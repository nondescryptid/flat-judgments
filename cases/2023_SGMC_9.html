He pleaded guilty to a charge of Voyeurism, committed in a female toilet on 5 February 2021, an offence under Section 377BB(5) of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”), as stated in MAC 900890 of 2021 (“the Charge”). He admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) in support of the Charge and was convicted accordingly.</a></p><a id="p1_1"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused also admitted to committing the connected offence of Criminal Trespass into the female toilet. He had also committed two other Voyeurism offences prior to 5 February 2021. He gave his consent for these three charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing on the Charge proceeded with.</a></p><a id="p1_2"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused was sentenced on 5 January 2023 to an imprisonment term of 15 days. After consultation with his defence counsel, the Accused decided to start his sentence on the same day and he has completed serving his sentence. The imprisonment term of 15 days had been calibrated to account for the time the Accused was in police custody after his arrest on 5 February 2021 and the time in remand from 6 to 19 February 2021 at the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”), amounting to a total period in legal custody of 15 days. In effect, the Accused was punished with 30 days of incarceration for the one Voyeurism offence, with three other charges taken into consideration. The Notice of Appeal against sentence was filed by a new lawyer on 18 January 2023.</a></p><a id="p1_3"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary of Facts</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manner of committing the offence was unremarkable and can be briefly stated. The Accused was 21 years old and a student at a local university. The victim was a 20-year-old female student at the same university. The Accused and the victim were not known to each other.</a></p><a id="p1_4"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 5 February 2021, the Accused was taking a break from his tutorial lesson at the university when he saw the victim enter a female toilet. He walked into the female toilet and entered the cubicle adjacent to the one the victim was using. The Accused took out his handphone to video-record the victim using the toilet. He held his phone below the cubicle partition with the rear camera lens facing upwards to capture the victim in the cubicle she was using.</a></p><a id="p1_5"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victim had partially undressed inside the cubicle, revealing her underwear, when she noticed the shadow in the adjacent cubicle. She saw the shoes of the Accused and the phone. She gave a shout and the Accused ran out of the toilet. The Accused deleted the recording and waited for the victim outside the toilet. He apologised to her. The victim went and informed her classmates and the Accused was detained by the campus security personnel. The Accused was placed under arrest when the police responded to the call from the university.</a></p><a id="p1_6"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Antecedents</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused did not have any previous convictions.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">MTO Report</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the High Court case of <em>GCX v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22758-SSP.xml')">[2019] SGHC 14</a> (“<em>GCX</em>”), parties agreed that it was prudent to call for a report on the suitability of the Accused for MTO (Mandatory Treatment Order). An MTO Suitability Report was prepared by IMH in which the appointed psychiatrist recommended a six-month treatment for the Accused. The psychiatrist opined that the Accused had early psychotic symptoms at the time of the offences which subsequently evolved to schizophrenia. The doctor further opined that “<em>while he had psychotic symptoms at the time of the offences, his judgement at the material times were not significantly impaired.</em>” After assessing the Accused, he was of the opinion that his early psychotic symptoms had a small to moderate contributory link to his offences.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Submissions on sentence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Prosecution’s submissions</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although MTO was recommended by the appointed psychiatrist, the Prosecution submitted that the Accused should be sentenced to imprisonment. Based on <em>GCX</em>, the Prosecution highlighted that MTO is to be imposed when rehabilitation is the dominant sentencing principle that outweighed other sentencing considerations. The Prosecution submitted that the dominant sentencing principle in this case is deterrence and not rehabilitation.</a></p><a id="p1_9"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DPP highlighted that the Accused had followed a fellow university student into a campus toilet and used a recording device to take a video of her while she was inside the cubicle. He noted that women should feel safe wherever they are – be it escalators, lifts, train cabins, on buses or in classrooms. The DPP submitted that when voyeuristic crimes involving recording devices are committed, the offences plainly call for a deterrent and retributive sentence – a custodial sentence – and a consistent message must be sent out to potential offenders that will deter them.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DPP framed the question as one of whether the Accused’s culpability was so significantly attenuated by the psychiatric condition such that a custodial sentence ought to be put aside. The DPP submitted that the answer was a clear no. The DPP pointed out that the MTO suitability report made it clear that the mental condition in this case only had a small or moderate contributory link to the offences. Furthermore, it was only after the offences were committed that these early psychotic symptoms evolved to schizophrenia. The MTO suitability report also made clear that at the time of the offences, the judgment of the Accused was not significantly impaired.</a></p><a id="p1_11"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution submitted that the mere existence of a psychiatric condition does not automatically reduce the importance of other sentencing principles. There is no indication that the Accused had difficulty appreciating the legal and moral wrongness of his actions.</a></p><a id="p1_12"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution was willing to accept that some sentencing discount can be given to the Accused’s psychiatric condition but this should not eclipse the need for a custodial term. In cases of voyeurism, the dominant sentencing principles engaged are general and specific deterrence. It was stated in <em>PP v Chong Hou En</em> [2015] 3SLR 222 (“<em>Chong Hou En</em>”) at [65] and [66] that given that mobile phones with camera functions are now ubiquitous, it has resulted in them becoming easier for like-minded offenders to prey on unsuspecting victims.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution submitted that a sentence of at least four weeks imprisonment will be appropriate to give effect to the sentencing principles of deterrence and rehabilitation in a balanced and fair manner. The Accused’s psychiatric treatment would not be significantly disrupted after serving a short custodial sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution objected to the imposition of a Short Detention Order (“SDO”) on the basis that a Community Based Sentence is inappropriate as it would not deter such offences. Furthermore, the Accused had committed two other similar Voyeurism offences which were taken into consideration for sentence. The offence for which he is to be sentenced was not a one-off incident. The DPP cited the case of <em>PP v Ryan You Jun Chao</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24940-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGMC 42</a> which was a case in which the accused was a university student who had entered a female toilet to take photographs of females using the toilet. The sentence passed was 7 weeks of imprisonment instead of SDO. That case shared similar aggravating factors with the present case and was upheld on appeal.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mitigation plea</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence submitted the focus for this case should be on rehabilitation. An MTO as recommended by the appointed psychiatrist from IMH should be imposed as the early psychotic symptoms had a contributory link to the offences he had committed. The MTO suitability report stated that his psychotic symptoms, which later evolved to schizophrenia, had a small to moderate contributory link to the offences. The Defence conceded the behaviour of the Accused immediately after the incident showed a degree of rationality and reason but this should not preclude him having an MTO imposed.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence submitted that rehabilitation is the dominant sentencing consideration in the present case and outweighs the considerations of general and specific deterrence. The Accused also has a high potential for rehabilitation and is unlikely to reoffend if given the appropriate treatment for his schizophrenia.</a></p><a id="p1_17"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offence of Voyeurism under Section 377BB(5) of the Penal Code is punishable with up to two years’ imprisonment or with fine or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments. The calibration of the appropriate sentence must take into account the harm caused and the offender’s culpability that is based on the assessment of the circumstances of the case and the relevant sentencing factors.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Guidance from Supreme Court cases</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of <em>Tan Yao Min v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21706-SSP.xml')">[2018] 3 SLR 1134</a> (“<em>Tan Yao Min</em>”) provides us with the relevant considerations in assessing the effect of a mental condition on sentence. Drawing from the decisions of the Court of Appeal in <em>Lim Ghim Peow v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16775-SSP.xml')">[2014] 4 SLR 1287</a> and the High Court in <em>Chong Hou En</em>, it is clear that the existence of a mental disorder is a relevant factor in the sentencing process. The manner and extent of its relevance depends on the circumstances, in particular, the nature and severity of the mental disorder. In spite of the existence of a mental condition, specific and general deterrence may remain relevant where the offence is premeditated or where there is a conscious choice to commit the offence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Appropriate Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I begin the consideration of the appropriate sentence by determining the type of sentence that should be imposed in this case where the Accused has been assessed to have a mental condition. On the facts of this case, the Accused’s actions reflected a high degree of culpability in the commission of the offence. It was a premeditated act and it was not due to a momentary lapse of judgment. He saw the victim entering the female toilet and he made a conscious choice to commit the offence of criminal trespass by following her into the female toilet in order to carry out the voyeuristic act. It had to be borne in mind that this was not the first occasion that he was involved in voyeurism, as evident from the two charges of voyeurism taken into consideration for sentencing.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with the DPP’s submissions that the Accused knew and was highly conscious of the wrongness of his conduct. I am of the view that the mental condition at the material time did not overshadow the seriousness of the offence. In the situation where the manner of committing the offence and the prevalence of the prohibited conduct, together with the difficulty of eradicating such offences and the potential harm for the fruits of such crime to be shared on a significant scale, the call for a deterrent response is warranted.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the sentencing principle of retribution that should not be ignored. The victim was alarmed by the Accused’s act that she let out a shout when she saw the shadow and the handphone camera pointing up in her direction while she was in a partial state of undress inside the toilet cubicle. The violation of the victim’s right of privacy and her sense of outrage at what happened to her are clear justification for invoking the sentencing principle of retribution to be applied. Therefore, the clear need for deterrence (together with a corollary call for retribution) has not been displaced by the prospects of rehabilitation for the offender in this case.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the length of the custodial sentence, it is not in dispute that a short period of incarceration for a first offender to be sentenced on one charge would be sufficient to send out the deterrent message. In passing the sentence, I had taken into account that the Accused had pleaded guilty which is a sign of remorse. Prosecution had submitted for a length of imprisonment of at least four weeks. The Prosecution’s submissions were fair and the sentence sought fully justified. In particular, the suggested sentence gave some mitigating weight to the contributory link of the mental state of the Accused at the time of the offence without compromising the deterrent message to be sent.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crux of the matter for the sentencing process in this case is whether the dominant sentencing principle is Deterrence or Rehabilitation. Based on a consideration of all the relevant factors and material circumstances of this case as described above, it was evident that the community-based sentencing options of MTO and SDO were not appropriate as the objective of Rehabilitation was outweighed by the major sentencing consideration of Deterrence with Retribution playing a minor role.</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sentence of 15 days of imprisonment imposed is to address the sentencing objectives of general deterrence and retribution as presented in this case. The calibration of the sentence had accounted for the time of fifteen days spent in custody – at the police station before being charged in court and at the IMH for psychiatric examination after being charged in court. In effect, the sentence passed is about one month. There were three offences taken into consideration for sentencing – two for similar offences of Voyeurism committed on two occasions prior to the instant offence and one for criminal trespass in the commission of the instant offence.</a></p><a id="p1_25"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one last point to be addressed before I conclude. There was a suggestion that the Accused had acted upon hearing a voice telling him to commit the offence. I am unpersuaded by this, in the light of the fact that there was no mention of him informing anyone of this voice in his head at the material time. He had waited outside the female toilet and apologised to the victim, knowing full well he had committed an offence against her. There is no mention of the Accused having told the victim, the campus security officers or the police that he was labouring under a voice in his head telling him how to act or what to do. In fact, the Accused had admitted to the police that he did the act as he was feeling very stressed and very emotional. He also admitted that he had done it multiple times before and would usually target Chinese females (at paragraph 7 of the SOF).</a></p><a id="p1_26"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the mother of the Accused had informed the IMH team that she was not aware of the Accused hearing the voice (refer to the IMH report dated 20 May 2022 of Dr Koh Wun Wu Kenneth Gerard (“Dr Koh”) at paragraph 4.) The mother mentioned that her son had been complaining of stress but she did not observe any odd behaviour suggestive of psychosis in him such as abnormal suspiciousness or deterioration in self-care.</a></p><a id="p1_27"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the various psychiatric reports, these psychotic symptoms were only mentioned and brought up for attention after he was caught for the offences. It is pertinent to note that the Accused had remarked to the IMH psychiatrist Dr Derrick Yeo that now that he had committed a criminal offence, he felt that the ‘voice’ was to be blamed and not himself (refer to paragraph 10 of the IMH report dated 18 February 2021). At Paragraph 14 of this IMH report, it was stated that the Accused maintained that he was not at fault for taking the video as he consistently blamed the voice that he was hearing for ‘making him do the wrong thing’. He would repeatedly ask for psychiatric treatment to be started for him as he would insist that his ‘voice’ was a symptom of a mental illness and asked the psychiatrist to help him ensure that he can continue with his studies at NTU. The Accused was also not forthcoming about having previously taken videos of other female victims in the past but claimed that this was the first time that he had been caught for such an offence.</a></p><a id="p1_28"> </a></div></content></html>
