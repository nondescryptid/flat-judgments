The complainant ascertained the driver to be that of the accused. Upon screening, it was found that the accused had driven the said motorcar while under disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving license for all classes of vehicles.

The accused has also contravened s 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Chapter 189, 2000 Rev Ed) and thereby committed an offence punishable under s 3(2) read with s 3(3) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation Act (Chapter 189, 2000 Rev Ed).</a></p><a id="p1_9"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further investigations revealed that on 3 December 2021, at about 2.30am, the accused went to retrieve the said motorcar from Golden Hill Estate, which was left behind by the last user, with the intention to drive back to his residence at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5.

The vehicle bearing license plate number SJX170Y is one of the cars the business offers for rental. The car was initially parked in the vicinity of the accused’s friend’s residence. The accused had a customer who had arranged for the car to be rented in the morning of 3 December 2021. It was the usual practice for the accused to use his residential address as the pickup point for customers to collect and return the rented cars.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence had submitted that the accused had driven the car as he as he was unable to find a driver willing to drive it to his residence on his behalf. As the customer was going to collect the car in the morning, he needed time to have the car ready for a handover in the morning. This was why he wanted to have the car back at his residence earlier.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Sentencing considerations</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence had acknowledged that while the sentencing precedents do not support the imposition of a fine, the Court was urged to consider a non-custodial term for the s 43(4)(<em>a</em>) of the RTA charge, a fine of up to S$600 for the insurance charge, and a global disqualification period of 12 months.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was submitted that the starting point for a first offender for an offence of driving while under disqualification is an imprisonment term of four to eight weeks: <em>Fam Shey Yee v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 3 SLR 0927.xml')">[2012] 3 SLR 927</a> at [12](“<em>Fam Shey Yee</em>”). It was further submitted that a sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment and a 12-month disqualification were imposed in <em>Public Prosecutor v Soyed Foysal Ahamed Pavel</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21806-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGDC 131</a>.

It was highlighted that the Court had considered the fact that the accused in that case appeared to have no intention of giving up his driving license in spite of a court order and that the offence was committed about six months after the initial disqualification of 23 months for drink driving. It was the Defence’s position that from the sentencing precedents, it does appear that a sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment is the norm.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence had sought to distinguish the precedents above on the following basis:</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_24-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It did not appear that the accused drove for a long distance.

Deterrence is an important principle that underlies our sentencing jurisprudence and it is directed at keeping crime rates in check (<em>PP v Tan Fook Sum</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1999] 1 SLR(R) 1022.xml')">[1999] 1 SLR(R) 1022</a> at [18]). General deterrence aims to educate and deter other like-minded members of the general public by making an example of a particular offender (<em>Meeran bin Mydin v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1998] 1 SLR(R) 0522.xml')">[1998] 1 SLR(R) 522</a> at [9]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the 2019 amendments to the Road Traffic Act, the maximum prescribed punishment for both a first and repeat offender for an offence of driving while under disqualification under s 43(4) of the RTA was a fine not exceeding $10,000 or an imprisonment term not exceeding 3 years or both. Since the amendments to the RTA on 1 November 2019, the punishment for a repeat offender under s 43(4)(<em>b</em>) of the RTA has been enhanced to a fine not exceeding $20,000 or to imprisonment not exceeding six years or to both, to provide stronger deterrence against re-offending. The present charge was committed after the 2019 amendment to the RTA.</a></p><a id="p1_32"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the sentencing precedents relied upon by both the Prosecution and the Defence, it is evident that the starting point for an offence of driving while under disqualification has been enhanced from four to eight weeks’ imprisonment in <em>Fam Shey Yee</em> to a starting point of eight weeks’ imprisonment after the amendments to the RTA in both <em>Abdul Fathani</em> and <em>Peng Jianwen</em>.</a></p><a id="p1_33"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Driving whilst under a disqualification order is a strict liability offence. This was held by the High Court in <em>Chng Wei Meng v PP</em> [2002] 2 SLR (R) 581 (“<em>Chng Wei Meng</em>”) at [19] and affirmed in <em>Muhammad Saiful</em> at [23]). As such, the mere act of driving under a disqualification order is all that had to be proven for the offence to be made out: See [23] of <em>Muhammad Saiful</em>. In that case, Sundaresh Menon CJ had considered some specific types of mitigating and aggravating factors namely:</a></p><a id="p1_34"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34"></a><a id="p1_34-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge of the disqualification order;</a></p><a id="p1_34-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_34-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intentional and flagrant breaking of the law;</a></p><a id="p1_34-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_34-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Length of time from expiry of the original disqualification order;</a></p><a id="p1_34-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_34-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weight of surrounding circumstances.</a></p><a id="p1_34-p2_d"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Knowledge of disqualification order</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, the accused was convicted on 11 May 2021 in Court 7B for an offence of permitting another person to use a motor vehicle without the requisite insurance coverage under s 3(1) of the MVA. He was sentenced to a $600 fine and a 12 months’ disqualification and this sentence has not been set aside as no appeal was filed against this sentence. Hence, the accused was clearly aware that he was under a disqualification order when he drove the car on 3 December 2021.</a></p><a id="p1_35"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Intentional and flagrant breaking of the law</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was submitted that the accused had made a spontaneous decision to drive the car as he was unable to find a driver to drive it to his residence and that a customer was going to collect the car in the morning. I found it odd that the accused would make a spontaneous decision at 2:30am to collect the car when he was aware that a customer was going to collect the car that very morning. In my view, it was more likely that the accused had intentionally and in flagrant disregard of the law chosen to drive the car in the early hours of the morning in the hope of evading detection by the police.</a></p><a id="p1_36"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I was mindful that in the present case, a charge under s 177(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Penal Code had been taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence. The accused had admitted that he had furnished false information in respect of his NRIC number to the complainant at the material time. In my view, this is an aggravating factor as he had sought to conceal his wrongdoing from the complainant.</a></p><a id="p1_37"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Significant distance travelled</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused had driven from Golden Hill Estate and intended to drive back to his residence at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5 but was stopped along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 towards Upper Thomson Road. The Defence had argued that it did not appear that the accused had driven for a long distance. With respect, this estimation is inaccurate as a Google Map search indicates that the distance between Goldhill and his residence is between 10.8 km and 12.3 km depending on the route taken. Hence, it was clear that the accused had driven a significant distance before he was stopped by the complainant.</a></p><a id="p1_38"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Length of time from expiry of the original disqualification order</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By then, the accused was almost at the 7-month mark of his 12 months’ disqualification order. Although I agreed with the Defence that it was not a situation of the accused having offended early into the disqualification, he still had another five months of his disqualification to serve before he was permitted to take the requisite steps to obtain his driving licence again.</a></p><a id="p1_39"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a><a id="p1_40">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the above factors, there were clearly no extenuating or exceptional circumstances for the accused to drive while under a disqualification order. Hence, I agreed with the Prosecution that there were no good reasons to depart from the usual sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment and to impose a non-custodial sentence as submitted by the Defence.</a></p><a id="p1_40"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a><a id="p1_41">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the alternative, the Defence had urged the Court to impose a sentence of between four to six weeks’ imprisonment. In my view, such a sentence could only be considered had the offence been committed prior to 1 November 2019. In the present case, as the accused had intentionally and in flagrant disregard of the law, chosen to drive the car on 3 December 2021 for a significant distance, a sentence below the starting point of eight weeks’ imprisonment would clearly be inadequate. Furthermore, he had sought to evade detection when he gave false information in relation to his particulars to the complainant.</a></p><a id="p1_41"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a><a id="p1_42">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the above and as there were no exceptional circumstance that warranted a departure from the imposition of the usual custodial sentence, I was of the view that a custodial sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment for the s 43(4)(<em>a</em>) of the RTA charge was fair and justified.</a></p><a id="p1_42"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Disqualification order</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a><a id="p1_43">43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As observed by Sundaresh Menon CJ in <em>Muhammad Saiful</em> at [18] a disqualification period shorter than the original disqualification period would do little to deter future like-minded offenders. It is an important punitive element for offences of drink driving and under s 43(4) of the RTA. He further observed at [19] that a disqualification order also prevents these offenders from driving and endangering themselves and other road users. The imposition of another, longer disqualification period would help ensure that such drivers are kept off the roads for a longer period of time.</a></p><a id="p1_43"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a><a id="p1_44">44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the above, I was of the view that a disqualification order for a period of 24 months for all classes of vehicles was necessary both as a form of specific and general deterrence. A disqualification order that is twice the original order is also necessary as a form of punitive element in the present case in view of the aggravating circumstances in the present case. Furthermore, in the present case, there were no mitigating circumstances which would suggest that a 24-month period is disproportionate. Hence, a 12-month disqualification period as submitted by the Defence would clearly be inadequate.</a></p><a id="p1_44"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a><a id="p1_45">45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had ordered the disqualification order to take effect from the date of release as the starting point where an accused is sentenced to a disqualification order as well as a period of imprisonment, the former should commence at the end of the period of imprisonment. This follows as a matter of common sense since an accused would already be physically incapacitated from driving during his term of imprisonment without any need for a disqualification and an overlap between a disqualification order and a concurrent term of imprisonment would undermine the penal effect of the disqualification order (see <em>Muhammad Saiful</em> at [39] and [46(a)].</a></p><a id="p1_45"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">S 3(1) of the MVA </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a><a id="p1_46">46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As set out above, the accused was previously convicted for a similar offence under s 3(1) of the MVA on 11 May 2021. This sentence had not been set aside as no appeal was filed against this sentence. As the accused was previously fined $600 and disqualified for a 12-month period, the same sentence as proposed by the Defence would be wholly inadequate. Furthermore, I noted that the Defence had not pointed to any special reasons for the Court not to impose a disqualification order or a shorter period of disqualification. In the present case, I agreed with the Prosecution that the maximum fine of $1,000 should be imposed on the accused in view of his re-offending within seven months after his earlier conviction.</a></p><a id="p1_46"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a><a id="p1_47">47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, a disqualification order for a period of 24 months for all classes of vehicles was necessary both as a form of specific and general deterrence. A disqualification order that is twice the original order is also necessary as a form of punitive element in the present case, in view of the aggravating circumstances in the present case. I had ordered the disqualification to take effect from the date of conviction as expressly provided under s 3(3) of the MVA.</a></p><a id="p1_47"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a><a id="p1_48">48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, a fine of $1,000 in default five days’ imprisonment and disqualification for a period of 24 months from the date of conviction was fair and justified in the circumstances.</a></p><a id="p1_48"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a><a id="p1_49">49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused was aware that his disqualification order for his previous offences commenced from 11 May 2021. His offences were discovered when he was stopped for checks by the complainant along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 in the early hours of 3 December 2021 when he was on the way home. This present case serves to illustrate the difficulty in detecting such offences under the RTA and the MVA and the need to impose deterrent sentences as part of the Court’s sentencing consideration.</a></p><a id="p1_49"> </a></div></content></html>
