The accused had driven his motor van, GBG6849T, without due care and attention as the accused, while driving on lane 1 of 3 lanes, had failed to keep a proper control of the motor van thus resulting in a head to rear collision with FBP4225J, SMX8723P and SMT667S.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Injuries</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first and second victims were not injured while the third victim was conveyed by ambulance from the accident scene to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).

Subsequently, it shows motor van GBG6849T, which was travelling on lane 1 of 3 lanes, colliding onto motorcycle FBP4225J, then motorcar SMX8723P, causing motorcar SMX8723P to collide into motorcar SMT667S.</a></p><a id="p1_12"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footage from an unknown passer-by shows motor van GBG6849T travelling on lane 1 of 3 lanes and overtaking two slow-moving vehicles which were on lane 2.

Motor van, GBG6849T then rear-ended vehicles FBP4225J, SMX8723P, causing SMX8723P to rear-end SMT667S.

He was driving at a fast speed and did not slow down when vehicles in front of him had slowed down. For the harm caused, it was submitted that there were three victims involved. The total cost of repairs to the vehicles was high and one of the victims was injured. It was further submitted that the harm in this case would be moderate after considering the costs of repairs and the injuries suffered.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigation</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused is self-employed and operates a logistics company that serves ‘Lazada’ customers. He is often personally involved in the collection and delivery of goods and greatly reliant on his driver’s licence. When his company is assigned to deliver high value items, the accused is expected to handle these deliveries personally and is unable to delegate such tasks to other drivers. It was submitted that a lengthy disqualification period would have a crushing effect on the accused’s livelihood.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was further submitted that by pleading guilty, the accused had saved precious time and resources. He deeply regretted that his carelessness had caused both injury and financial loss to other road users. After the accident, he had remained at the scene to assist the victim and investigating authorities.</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the Defence sought fines of $2,000 and 11 months’ disqualification for the first charge and $1,000 and 3 months’ disqualification for the second charge.</a></p><a id="p1_25"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In support of the sentencing position for the first charge, the Defence had relied on five unreported cases in the table of sentencing precedents involving offences under s 65(4)(<em>a</em>) of the RTA. It was submitted that the present case is not more egregious as compared to the highlighted precedents.</a></p><a id="p1_26"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the second charge, it was further submitted that a search on the Sentencing Information and Research Repository (“SIRS”) showed that the mean sentence among 58 cases prosecuted under s 65(5)(<em>a</em>) of the RTA is a fine of $1,000. It was highlighted in <em>Public Prosecutor v Rizuwan Bin Rohmat</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26656-SSP.xml')">[2021] SGDC 219</a> (“<em>Rizuwan</em>”), in respect of a charge punishable under s 65(5)(<em>a</em>) of the RTA, the offender was sentenced to a $1,000 fine and 3 months’ disqualification. The offender had failed to keep a proper lookout when forming up at a red traffic light junction and collided his motor van into a stationary vehicle. It was the Defence’s case that the second charge in the present case is not more egregious. Accordingly, a $1,000-fine and 3 months’ disqualification was appropriate.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prosecution’s Reply</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the plea in mitigation, the Prosecution highlighted that the cases cited by the Defence were unreported. In addition, there was no mention of cost of damage to the vehicles. It was submitted that in the present case, one of the significant costs is the high cost of damage.</a></p><a id="p1_28"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, as the accused was driving a motor van, the culpability would be higher as compared to if he had driven a motor car. It is still a larger vehicle than a saloon car.</a></p><a id="p1_29"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision on disqualification order</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the accused had been convicted of two charges in connection with the driving of a motor vehicle, pursuant to s 42(1) of the RTA, I had to consider whether an order disqualification should be imposed. S 42(1) provides that that a court before which a person convicted of an offence in connection with the driving of a motor vehicle may, where so required by this Act, order him to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for life or for such period as the court may think fit. If the disqualification period imposed is one year or longer, an additional prescribed test of competence to drive needs to be taken by the offender under s 43(1)(<em>b</em>) of the RTA before the offender is allowed to drive again.</a></p><a id="p1_30"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, the accused while driving his motor van, a vehicle larger than a normal motorcar, on an expressway with moderate traffic flow, was involved in a head to rear collision with three vehicles. Hurt was caused to one of the victims as he was hospitalised for three days and given 26 days of medical leave. In addition, substantial property damage was caused to the said three vehicles. From the footage from an unknown passer-by, the accused’s motor van was seen travelling on lane 1 of 3 lanes and overtaking two slow moving vehicles which were on lane 2. Subsequently, vehicles on lane 1 were seen slowing down. His motor van then rear-ended vehicles FBP4225J, SMX8723P, causing SMX8723P to rear-end SMT667S. The accused’s collision with the third victim’s motorcycle caused the third victim to be flung onto lane 2 of 3 lanes of the expressway. Hence, based on these circumstances, I agreed with the Prosecution that the harm caused should be pegged at moderate.</a></p><a id="p1_31"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that it was clear from the footages that the accident was caused from the accused’s aggressive manner of driving and his failure to keep a safe distance and speed as well as to keep a proper lookout of the vehicles ahead of him in lane 1 as they slowed down. I took into account the fact that at the time of accident, the weather was clear, the road surface was dry and the visibility was clear. There was no evidence before me that his view of the vehicle ahead of him was obstructed as he drove along lane 1 of the expressway.</a></p><a id="p1_32"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I had taken into account the accused’s plea of guilt, I was mindful that the accused did not have a clean driving record as he had compounded offences of speeding in April 2017 and failing to conform to a traffic red light signal in October 2019. The present offence was clearly not a one-off incident. Hence, I agreed with the Prosecution that his culpability was at the higher end of low.</a></p><a id="p1_33"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the circumstances of the commission of the offence including the accused’s manner of driving, the harm caused to the three victims as well as the potential risk and danger he posed to the other road users, I was of the view that a disqualification order should be imposed in respect of both charges. Although it was submitted by the Defence that a lengthy disqualification period would have a crushing effect on the accused’s livelihood, I placed little weight to this point as I did not find any exceptional circumstances in the present case not to impose a disqualification order.</a></p><a id="p1_34"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In deciding on the appropriate period of disqualification, I was mindful that the disqualification order and the sentence imposed are not mutually compensatory; an increase in the quantum of the fine imposed should not be taken to mandate the imposition of a reduced period of disqualification than would otherwise has been ordered: <em>Edwin s/o Suse Nathen v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 1139.xml')">[2013] 4 SLR 1139</a> at [13].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining the appropriate length of the disqualification order, I was guided by High Court’s approach in <em>Kwan Weiguang v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27557-SSP.xml')">[2022] SGHC 121</a> (“<em>Kwan</em>”). Although Aedit Abdullah J dealt with an appeal against a disqualification order of 15 months that was imposed on the appellant for an offence of dangerous driving under s 64(1) and punishable under s 64(2C)(<em>a</em>) of the RTA, the factors considered are relevant to the present case. He held at [59] and [61] that the objective of the disqualification order is as follow:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A driving disqualification order combines three sentencing objectives: punishment, protection of the public and deterrence (<em>Edwin s/o Suse Nathen v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 1139.xml')">[2013] 4 SLR 1139</a> (“<em>Edwin Nathen</em>”) at [13]). Often, due to the limited range of fines in the punishment provision, the impact of a disqualification order is likely to be felt much more acutely than any marginal increase in the quantum of the fine (<em>see Edwin Nathen</em> at [13]).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ensuring the safety of others in public is an important consideration. As discussed in Public Prosecutor v Ong Heng Chua and another appeal (“Ong Heng Chua”)<a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22524-SSP.xml')">[2018] 5 SLR 388</a> at [61]:</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">61&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the most important sentencing principles engaged in disqualification orders are the protection of society, because the objective of disqualification orders is to prevent future harm that the offender may cause to the public, and deterrence, because such orders deprive the offenders of the freedom to drive. In line with these principles, greater weight should be placed on the culpability of the offender in the commission of the offence as well as his driving record. These reflect how much of a danger he poses to society, and also indicative of the degree of specific deterrence necessary…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Protection is achieved by removing a dangerous driver from the roads to attenuate the risk of harm occasioned by bad or antisocial driving. Further, Parliament has made it clear that the ability to impose disqualification orders under s 42(1) of the RTA is meant to protect innocent road users from the potential danger posed by motorists who demonstrate violent or aggressive behaviour when reacting to situations connected with driving such as: flashing of head lamps, overtaking and disputes over parking spaces, <em>etc</em> (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (20 January 1999) vol 69 at col 1932 (Wong Kan Seng, Minister for Home Affairs).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">61&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A disqualification order also serves to remove the privilege to drive from those who have abused it, and this also reinforces the notion of shared usage of the roads. It must be remembered that driving is an inherently dangerous activity. The licence to drive is a privilege accorded to persons who, through a series of properly administered tests, have demonstrated that they are capable of meeting the standards expected of a reasonably competent driver (<em>Jali bin Mohd Yunos v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17093-SSP.xml')">[2014] 4 SLR 1059</a> at [36]). The former Minister for Home Affairs, Prof S Jayakumar, had expressed the following view which reinforces this notion (see Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (28 March 1990) vol 55 at col 960): “… we must get every driver in Singapore to note that when he is issued a licence, it is in fact a very special privilege and it is granted on condition that he drives in a responsible manner bearing in mind the interest of others.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Kwan</em> at [65] to [71], the relevant and material factors when determining the period of disqualification are:</a></p><a id="p1_37"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37"></a><a id="p1_37-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circumstances of the commission of the offence and</a></p><a id="p1_37-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_37-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued ability to drive and attitude towards other road users.</a></p><a id="p1_37-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, it was undisputed that a disqualification order was warranted in respect of both charges. What was in issue was the appropriate length. The Prosecution had sought a global disqualification period of between 15 to 18 months while the Defence had sought for a global period 11 months, a period which would not require the accused to take the additional prescribed test of competence for him to be able to drive again.</a></p><a id="p1_38"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the first charge, after the accused first collided into his motorcycle, the third victim was flung onto lane 2 of 3 lanes of the expressway. He suffered left knee and ankle contusion and was hospitalised for three days with 26 days of medical leave. It was fortunate that he did not suffer more serious injuries or was run over by oncoming vehicles in lane 2 of the busy expressway. It was also fortuitous that the oncoming vehicle in lane 2 was able to stop the vehicle on time to avoid hitting him.</a></p><a id="p1_39"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a><a id="p1_40">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having regard to the aggravating factors namely the accused’s manner of driving and the personal injury suffered by the third victim, I was of the view that an 18 months’ disqualification period was appropriate to achieve the three sentencing objectives of punishment, protection of the public and deterrence.</a></p><a id="p1_40"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a><a id="p1_41">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, a period of 11 months’ disqualification, as submitted by the Defence, was inadequate in view of the aggravating factors present in this case. I disagreed with the Defence’s position that the present case is not more egregious as compared to the five unreported precedents. In my view, the unreported precedents were unhelpful as they lacked precedential value and could also be distinguished as they involved only one victim unlike the present case which involved three victims.</a></p><a id="p1_41"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a><a id="p1_42">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the second charge, the accused’s head to rear collision with FBP4225J, SMX8723P and SMT667S had resulted in substantial property damage as set out at [14] to the three vehicles. There was also a fair degree of potential harm to other road users considering the conditions at the material time, including the moderate flow of traffic on the expressway. Having regard to the accused’s manner of driving and the substantial property damage caused to the three vehicles, I was of the view that a period of 15 months’ disqualification period was appropriate to achieve the three sentencing objectives of punishment, protection of the public and deterrence.</a></p><a id="p1_42"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a><a id="p1_43">43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not find the case of <em>Rizuwan</em> helpful as in that case, the offender had collided into the victim’s stationary motorcar which had come to a stop at a traffic red light signal on a normal road. Minor damage was caused to the victim’s motorcar. In the present case, the collision involving multiple vehicles had occurred along an expressway where vehicles travel at a higher speed with moderate flow of traffic. Hence, I disagreed that the second charge is not more egregious than the facts in <em>Rizuwan</em>.</a></p><a id="p1_43"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a><a id="p1_44">44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things considered, I was of the view that a period of disqualification of 18 months for all classes of driving licences for the first charge and a period of disqualification for 15 months for all classes of driving licences for the second charge with effect from 15 February 2023 was fair and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances of the case.</a></p><a id="p1_44"> </a></div></content></html>
