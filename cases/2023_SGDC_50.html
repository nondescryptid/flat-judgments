After overtaking the Accused’s car, Yap stepped on his brakes and reduced his speed to about 70km/h. The Accused swerved left to avoid a collision. Yap then immediately reduced his speed further to 56km/h.

At about 2.20pm, the Accused filtered from lane 2 to lane 1 and stopped next to (but slightly ahead of) Yap’s car. The Accused wound down his window and took a photograph of the front of Yap’s car. When the traffic light turned green, Yap turned right and drove along Tampines Avenue 1.

First, the Accused had displayed a high level of culpability as he (a) had driven in an “aggressive manner” to retaliate against Yap’s irresponsible driving, and (b) had displayed a blatant disregard for the safety of other road users.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Second, the Accused’s driving had posed “significant” harm given (a) the circumstances of the road condition at the material time, and (b) that extensive damage was caused to Yap’s and the Accused’s cars.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Third, the mitigating effect of the Accused’s guilty plea ought to be balanced against the fact that (a) he had compounded offences for speeding in 2007, 2014 and 2019, and (b) the Prosecution would have no difficulty in proving the charge against him given that there was a recording of his dangerous driving.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Finally, the proposed sentence of 3.5 months’ imprisonment was in line with <em>Public Prosecutor v Aw Tai Hock</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21249-SSP.xml')">[2017] 5 SLR 1141</a> (“<b><em>Aw Tai Hock</em></b>”), another road rage case, where five months’ imprisonment was imposed.

The Defence adduced a psychiatric report which stated that the Accused (a) had been labouring from adjustment disorder (with mixed anxiety and depressed mood) at the material time, (b) had acted out of character during the incident, and (c) had the general capacity for self-restraint. Finally, the Defence urged me to consider the fact that Yap had been sentenced to a fine when calibrating the Accused’s sentence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">My Decision</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having considered the matter, I imposed the following sentence:</a></p><a id="p1_9"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_9-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven months’ imprisonment, and</a></p><a id="p1_9-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_9-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disqualification from holding all classes of driving license for three years.</a></p><a id="p1_9-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In imposing the sentence, I have taken the following views:</a></p><a id="p1_10"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_10-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seriousness of an offence of dangerous or reckless driving is principally influenced by two factors.

The Accused’s dangerous driving comes within the more serious range in the spectrum of dangerous driving cases that are punishable under s 64(2C)(a).

To make out an offence of dangerous or reckless driving, all that the Prosecution needs to prove are the <em>elements</em> in s 64(1) – namely, that (i) the offender has driven a motor vehicle, (ii) the vehicle has been driven on a road, and (iii) the vehicle has been driven recklessly or at a speed or in a manner which is dangerous to the public.

In this regard, the settled position prior to the 2019 RTA amendments is that the gravity of an offence of dangerous or reckless driving is principally influenced by two factors. First, the extent of harm caused by the driving.

Our roads are not playgrounds or battle arenas for the Accused and other angry drivers to taunt road users or to exact vengeance. It has been rightly held that “[t]he desire [of a driver] to avenge a wrong is a human failing that society must not encourage, as it would lead him to take the law into his own hands.

This principle applies where two or more offenders are sentenced for participating in the <em>same</em> criminal enterprise. Under the parity principle, the sentences passed on them should generally be the same, unless there is a relevant difference in their responsibility or their personal circumstances: <em>Muhamad Azmi bin Kamil v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/28899-SSP.xml')">[2022] SGCA 68</a> at [25].</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the parity principle does not apply in the present case. It bears noting that the Accused and Yap had committed <em>different</em> acts of dangerous driving.

This is because no grounds of decision was issued for Yap’s sentence. In the absence of a reasoned decision, it is not possible to discern what had weighed on the mind of the judge when sentencing Yap: <em>Janardana Jayasankarr v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19421-SSP.xml')">[2016] 4 SLR 1288</a> (“<b><em>Janardana</em></b>”) at [13(b)].</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Sentencing precedents</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50">50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage, I wish to briefly comment on the sentencing precedents under s 64 submitted by the parties. I did not find these precedents to be helpful as they are not similar to the Accused’s offence. Let me elaborate.</a></p><a id="p1_50"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Aw Tai Hock</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a><a id="p1_51">51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Aw Tai Hock</em> was decided before the amendment to s 64. In my view, sentences imposed in precedents such as <em>Aw Tai Hock</em> are of little precedential value in sentencing cases under s 64(2C)(a). My reasons are as follows.</a></p><a id="p1_51"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51"></a><a id="p1_51-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated earlier, prior to 2019, s 64 prescribed only a single range of punishment (up to a maximum fine of $5,000 and a maximum term of imprisonment for 12 months) for all types of dangerous or reckless driving – including those which caused death and grievous hurt. Given that the sentencing for the entire range of dangerous or reckless driving cases was capped at 12 months’ imprisonment, significant terms of imprisonment under s 64 would logically be appropriate only where serious personal injury had been caused.</a></p><a id="p1_51-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_51-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, prior to the 2019 amendments, it would not be appropriate to impose significant imprisonment terms where no serious personal injury had been caused. This was so even where the dangerous or reckless driving was particularly egregious and serious property damage had been caused. That is why despite finding the case to be “clearly one of the worst cases of dangerous driving” (see judgement at [46]), the High Court in <em>Aw Tai Hock</em> imposed only five months’ imprisonment – i.e., less than half of the prescribed punishment – as only minor personal injury was caused in that case (the victim suffered only musculoskeletal injuries and was given four days’ medical leave).</a></p><a id="p1_51-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_51-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no longer the case after the 2019 amendments. Courts can now sentence an offender under s 64(2C)(a) up to the maximum punishment of 12 months’ imprisonment even if his dangerous or reckless driving does not cause any personal injury. As stated earlier, the legislative intent behind the 2019 amendment is to provide stronger deterrence against irresponsible drivers and thus make our roads safer. It would thus be remiss of the courts for not applying the full sentencing spectrum in s 64(2C)(a) in egregious cases of dangerous or reckless driving simply because no personal injury has been caused.</a></p><a id="p1_51-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_52">52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the above, there are other reasons why the sentence in <em>Aw Tai Hock</em> should not set a glass ceiling for the Accused’s sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_52"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52"></a><a id="p1_52-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, if the same offence in <em>Aw Tai Hock</em> were to be committed today, it is possible that the offence will <em>not</em> be punished under s 64(2C)(a).</a></p><a id="p1_52-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_52-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_52-p2_a-p3_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this because Andy (the subject of the offender’s road rage in that case) had suffered injuries after colliding into another car when attempting to evade the offender’s dangerous driving: <em>Public Prosecutor v Aw Tai Hock</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20333-SSP.xml')">[2017] SGDC 131</a> at [5].

Under this approach, a court will first consider what would be an appropriate sentence under s 64(2C)(a) based on the gravity of the dangerous or reckless driving alone. Thereafter, the court will apply a suitable uplift to that sentence by having regard to the severity of the hurt caused. The maximum extent of this uplift will be $5,000/one year’s imprisonment – i.e., the difference between the maximum punishment under s 64(2B)(a) ($10,000/two years’ imprisonment) and the maximum punishment under s 64(2C)(a) ($5,000/one year’s imprisonment).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, if the offence in <em>Aw Tai Hock</em> is punishable under s 64(2C)(a), then it is likely that the offender will receive a sentence higher than the five months’ imprisonment originally imposed by the High Court.

The offender had driven dangerously by (a) repeatedly changing lanes ahead of a car driven by a person that he was unhappy with (“<b>the victim</b>”) and (b) subsequently stopping his car in a position that was likely to cause danger to other road users on lane 2 of 3 lanes of Keppel Road at about 8.34 pm. The offender was fined $1,600 and disqualified from driving all classes of driving license for 15 months. The offender appealed against his driving disqualification. On appeal, the disqualification period was reduced to 12 months.

In this decision, I have explained why a sentence higher than that proposed by the Prosecution is warranted, and is in line with the principle that the full sentencing spectrum in s 64(2C)(a) should be considered in sentencing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64">64&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a doubt, dangerous or reckless driving where vehicles have been used as instruments of intimidation and destruction constitute one of the most serious types of offences punishable under s 64(2C)(a).

This is so even if the road user does not suffer any personal injury as a result. No matter how serious the actions of a provocateur may have been, a <em>vehicular assault</em> on him or his vehicle can never be condoned. Driving is an inherently dangerous activity.
