The accused claimed that V2 then made a subsequent video call to him, and also exchanged phone calls and added him on Facebook. The accused also repeated his claim, made in his statement P3, that V2 likes and loves him. Further, the accused said that V2 did not want him to keep a relationship with V1, and wanted to be in a relationship with him instead.

He then gave V1 money to buy drinks for them, leaving him alone with V2. The latter repeated that she loved him, and also allegedly hugged him and kissed him on the shoulder and forehead. He reciprocated by kissing her on the forehead and hugging her. While the accused admitted that he touched V2 on her thighs, he denied touching her breasts.

He said that V1 even took a photo of him when they were at Marsiling Park. The accused also confirmed as correct his answer given in P3 Q4A4, that V1 had kissed him on his right cheek, and that he kissed V1 on her left cheek, but said that he did not touch her.

However, in light of the evidence of the recording officer about the mental conditions of the alleged victims and their responses during the recording process, as well as the amount of involvement and assistance needed in order to elicit their answers (due to the mental state of the alleged victims), out of an abundance of caution, I was of the view that the alleged victims’ statements could not be safely relied on in deciding the issues of the case. This was so even though the statements did, <em>prima facie</em>, appear to provide information as to the offences allegedly committed by the accused against the alleged victims. In deciding the issue of guilt, I also did not consider the contents of the alleged victims’ statements – in particularly the parts of their statements that implicated the accused – since the latter did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the alleged victims in court.</a></p><a id="p1_29"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For completeness, I would add that the position I took vis-à-vis the alleged victims’ statements, appeared to be largely consistent with the position stance by the Prosecution.

Further, as could be seen from the table at [31] above, as regards the <em>actus reus</em> of the offences, P3 itself contained many of the admissions that formed the subject matter of the charges against the accused.</a></p><a id="p1_36"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, while the accused’s statements did contain features that were exculpatory or which downplayed his role, and the accused also alluded to alleged consensual behaviour on the part of the alleged victims, I would add that in assessing the contents of both P2 and P3, I was mindful of the guidance provided by the Court of Appeal in <em>Chan Kin Choi v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1991] 1 SLR(R) 0111.xml')">[1991] 1 SLR(R) 111</a>, that in respect of any mixed statement, both the incriminating and the exculpatory parts of a mixed statement should be considered by the trial judge in determining where the truth lay, although it would usually be the case that the incriminating parts were likely to be true whereas excuses would not carry the same weight: (see [34] and [35]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking into account all relevant considerations, there was clearly no reason to doubt the accuracy of the contents of the P2 and P3, in particular the admissions made by the accused as to his commission of the <em>actus reus</em> of the offences. These admissions were voluntarily made, and had been interpreted by an independent Bangladeshi interpreter and recorded by ASP Ong. Thus, as set out at [31] above, the accused’s statements showed, amongst other things, that he had deliberately and intentionally carried out the offending acts against the two alleged victims, on the dates, times and places reflected in the charges.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether there was any valid consent to the sexual acts</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having found that the <em>actus reus</em> of the offences was established, I now consider whether the Prosecution has successfully proved the other elements of the charges.

At [40], Justice See Kee Oon (“<b>See J</b>”) held that “…the essential elements which would make up valid consent are fundamentally similar irrespective of whether the court is dealing with sexual or non-sexual offences”. Further, See J made clear at [40] that in order for consent to operate as a complete defence, the Defence must satisfy the following threshold requirements “at the minimum”:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><em>There must be voluntary participation on the part of the “victim” after he/she had been able to appreciate the significance and the moral quality of the act proposed to be done</em></b> (see <em>Pram Nair</em> at [93]).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be some element of agreement as to what is proposed to be done to the “victim”. In this regard, it is a question of fact whether there was an agreement, which can be implied or express and there is no requirement for any conventional contractual analysis. What is important is that the “victim” must know the nature of the act proposed to be done and the reasonably foreseeable consequences of the act (see <em>Balakrishnan</em> at [104]– 105]).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must not be any fact which calls into question whether consent was given voluntarily. <b><em>In this regard, the presence of any of the vitiating factors in s 90 of the Penal Code would be prima facie evidence of a lack of voluntariness</em></b>. It is also clear from the definition of “injury” in s 44 of the Penal Code, that “injury” for the purposes of s 90(a)(i) of the Penal Code would encompass any harm “illegally caused to any person, in body, mind, reputation or property” (see Yeo, Morgan &amp; Chan at para 19.19).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"></p><div align="right">[emphasis added] </div><p></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Assessing the capacity of the alleged victims to consent to the accused’s acts</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53">53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, the Prosecution essentially led evidence from expert witnesses, as well as from witnesses who know and/or who are familiar with the alleged victims, to show that the alleged victims lacked the capacity to consent to the accused’s acts set out in the charges.

All of these lay witnesses had also given evidence of their own interactions with the alleged victims which clearly pointed to mental incapacity on the part of the alleged victims. That the evidence of these witnesses was able to withstand challenge by the Defence in court, also bolstered the conclusions separately reached by the psychiatrists of the mental deficiency of the alleged victims, and their incapacity to consent to the sexual offences committed by the accused against them.</a></p><a id="p1_65-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_66">66&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, I accepted the evidence of the IMH psychiatrists that owing to their mental disability of the alleged victims, they could thus not have understood the nature and consequence of the accused’s acts that he had carried out against them, and that they lacked the mental incapacity to consent to the various sexual acts that the accused had committed.</a></p><a id="p1_66"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a><a id="p1_67">67&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would add that in any event, based on the observations of the experts, as well as evidence of the lay witnesses who were familiar with or who had interacted with the alleged victims, it seemed highly unlikely that the alleged victims would have behaved towards the accused in the manner that he suggested, as the alleged victims had clear limitations in their ability to speak English, and they did not appear to take to strangers as readily or as freely as the accused claimed. In other words, it was highly unbelievable the accused’s claims that the alleged victims had been so forward with him, or that they had largely “come on to him” rather than the other way round. In this regard, it was improbable that they had consented to the acts of a sexual nature that he had committed against them.</a></p><a id="p1_67"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a><a id="p1_68">68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, even if I were to give the benefit of the doubt to the accused, and accepted his claim that the alleged victims had “consented to the sexual acts” committed by the accused, nonetheless, under section 90(b) of the Penal Code, their mental incapacity would have vitiated any consent that they may have given for such acts, such that any alleged consent on their part would not constitute valid consent. In other words, because the alleged victims were incapable of giving consent, then it would not matter whether [they] ostensibly did do so, since any such consent would not be valid in law.

Mr Leung said that V2’s English was very basic, and she would answer in short sentences of less than 10 words.

This was especially so since the accused undoubtedly had plenty of opportunities and time to interact with and to observe both alleged victims at or before the time of the offences. Specifically:</a></p><a id="p1_89"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89"></a><a id="p1_89-p2_a">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 18 November 2018, prior to committing the offence set out in the 1st charge against V1, the accused had dinner with V1 (which lasted for at least 15 minutes) and had asked her for directions; and</a></p><a id="p1_89-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_89-p2_b">b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to committing the offence set out in the 6th charge against V2, the accused had a videocall with V2 and also conversed with her on the phone no less than three times.

In this regard, the audio transcript (P19) of his conversation with PW8 and others, clearly showed that the accused can converse in English with normal-functioning adults. Further, as noted earlier, the accused’s own evidence that he has to interact with normal-functioning adults in English, would clearly have alerted him to the differences in the alleged victims’ behaviour and speech patterns from those of normal adults. I would add that while this was not evidence I placed particular emphasis on, I also agreed with the Prosecution that to some extent at least, this conclusion that the accused was aware that the alleged victims were not normal functioning adults, was fortified by the recorded conversations that the accused had with PW8 on 8 December 2018 (see P19 and P20). <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91">91&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the overwhelming evidence was that the accused would have been aware of the mental incapacity of the alleged victims, and could hardly have made a mistake that they had the consented or had the capacity to consent to the sexual acts that he carried out on them.</a></p><a id="p1_91"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a><a id="p1_92">92&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, the Defence has failed, abysmally, to establish that the defence of mistake applied to excuse the offences, since not a single one of the requisite elements of the defence, let alone all of them, has been established by the Defence on a balance of probabilities.

Without going into any great detail about these contradictions which the Prosecution had carefully set out in its submissions, I would only add that the inconsistencies and clearly unbelievable claims made by the accused, as highlighted by the Prosecution, were never properly accounted for by the accused in his testimony, nor were they even addressed by counsel in submissions, despite the Defence being given ample opportunity to do so.</a></p><a id="p1_95"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a><a id="p1_96">96&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, I also noted that the Defence adopted a constantly shifting and inconsistent stance as regards the contents, and belatedly, even the voluntariness, of the accused’s statements, P2 and P3. In this regard, in the course of his testimony, the accused had raised claims about various alleged inaccuracies contained in his police statements P2 and P3, and also about his condition when he was giving his statements, when these same issues were never raised by his counsel when the recorder, ASP Ong, or the interpreter, Mr Abdul were on the stand. Further, despite the contradictory position adopted by the accused and his counsel, I noted that the accused’s counsel, when putting up the Defence submissions, again made no attempt to address such obviously conflicting and unsatisfactory aspects of the Defence.</a></p><a id="p1_96"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a><a id="p1_97">97&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffice to say, it was clear that as the accused’s accounts were full of contradictions, and generally impossible to believe. I found him to be a witness of little credit. I thus agreed with the Prosecution that the accused’s version of affairs, and his exculpatory claims, should be rejected in full.</a></p><a id="p1_97"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a><a id="p1_98">98&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For completeness, I would add that the issue of the accused’s credibility was of particular importance in the present case in light of the defence of mistake that the Defence had attempted to put forward, especially as the accused was the only witness for the Defence. Since the burden was on him to establish this defence, that the accused kept giving inconsistent and incredible accounts, and made himself a highly unbelievable witness, made it even more of an uphill task for the defence of mistake to be established. In any event, as I have already explained why I was of the view that the defence of mistake had not been made out, I shall say no more about this matter.</a></p><a id="p1_98"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Alleged victims’ failure to testify and the issue of competency</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a><a id="p1_99">99&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarise, I found that the Prosecution had successfully established beyond a reasonable doubt:</a></p><a id="p1_99"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99"></a><a id="p1_99-p2_a">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elements of the offences;</a></p><a id="p1_99-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_99-p2_b">b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That there was no valid consent by the alleged victims to the acts committed by the accused against them that are the subject matter of the respective charges; and</a></p><a id="p1_99-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_99-p2_c">c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That there was no valid defence raised as to the charges.</a></p><a id="p1_99-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_100">100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above findings would have been sufficient to find the accused guilty on all six of the charges that were proceeded with against him.</a></p><a id="p1_100"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a><a id="p1_101">101&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, for completeness, I now deal with the issue about the absence of testimony from the alleged victims.

PW8 also said described V1 as being able to communicate well with her 3-year-old son, while they (the adults) have to adapt their way of asking her as if she was a kid.

He was concerned that she may actually panic or be in shock and refuse to say anything. Dr Leong also noted that prior to his third meeting with V2, where she greeted Dr Leong, V2 was very shy, and she would look down, and respond with very slow and very startled speech. V2 basically just looked at her father whenever Dr Leong posed a question.</a></p><a id="p1_113-p2_a-p3_i"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_113-p2_a-p3_i"></a><a id="p1_113-p2_a-p3_ii">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V2 also has very limited speech ability, and does not have good command of language. In terms of V2’s speech, she couldn’t speak full sentences, and most of the time, it’s just two to three words, and she would use very simple words. After saying two to three words, she will just pause and freeze. V2 also needed a lot of prompting and he had to give her a lot of cues in order for her to continue to speak. Her answers were unclear and, at times, irrelevant during parts of the interview which she did not comprehend and thus required her father to answer on her behalf.<sup><span class="FootnoteRef"></span></sup></a><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a> Dr Leong said that even both her parents could only comprehend about 50% of what her verbal expression was.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_113-p2_a-p3_iii">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While V2 was orientated to time and place, she was unable to articulate the days of the week in order, nor give the date or year.</a></p><a id="p1_113-p2_a-p3_iii"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_113-p2_a-p3_iii"></a><a id="p1_113-p2_a-p3_iv">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dr Leong approached V2 about court proceedings, he noted that she doesn’t understand about court proceedings, the judge, the law, and the various other aspects. She also started to get very distressed when Dr Leong kept asking some questions. V2’s father said that it was best for V2 not to go to court, since similar to her experience when going to the nursery, she would cry inconsolably. V2 would start to do this in a new and strange environment.</a></p><a id="p1_113-p2_a-p3_iv"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_113-p2_a-p3_iv"></a><a id="p1_113-p2_a-p3_v">(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, Dr Leong said that from his understanding and assessment of V2 as being moderately intellectual disabled, she would not be able to attend court.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a> His view was that she was highly unlikely to be able to follow normal court proceedings due to her disability. Further, Dr Leong opined that because of V2’s moderate intellectual disability, she was not fit to testify. His view was that it was very likely that she will act out, break down, and freeze if she has to come to court. It was also highly unlikely that she can understand questions put to her or give rational answers to these questions because this is a strange and new environment to her. Her answers may also be irrelevant because of her anxiety.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_113-p2_b">b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards V2’s psychological assessment by Mr Leung, the latter had conducted a psychological test, and conducted an interview with V2 with V2’s father present for part of that interview. Ms Leung had ascertained from an initial conversation with V2 that the latter was unable to answer simple questions such as what she was doing, or what she was working as. V2 also had to be prompted by her father to answer questions, and her responses would be to nod and say “Yes”. Further, V2 was not able to elaborate even though Mr Leung provided prompts to encourage her to do so. In his report P17 on V2, Mr Leung had noted that while V2’s speech was generally coherent and relevant during simple conversations, her answers were unclear and at times irrelevant during some parts of the interview which she did not comprehend. She thus required V2’s father to answer on her behalf. V2 was also unable to provide her NRIC number and could not articulate the days of the week in order and was not oriented to the date, month and year stating that it was year 2013 at the time of assessment despite prompts. Mr Leung opined that V2 met the full criteria of the intellectual disability as defined by the DSM-5, and was hence, mild to moderately intellectually disabled.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_113-p2_c">c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW5, who was V2’s father, testified that when V2 was born, she was a “blue baby”. When she was 7 years old, the nursery refused to accept her because she was not mentally fit, and they subsequently enrolled her in MINDS school. He said that V2 does things very slowly, she could not walk straight or steadily because her mind could not concentrate, and she could probably string less than 5 words in a sentence, and these were not complete sentences. Neither could V2 carry out a conversation in English as she would use short forms. While he was able to understand her, PW5 doubted that other people would understand what she wants.

Counsel further argued that the accused had essentially been “neglecting to exercise reasonable diligence” in respect of ascertaining that the consent of [V1] was not real consent.

These were the degree of sexual exploitation in terms of the nature and extent of acts involved in the various outrage of modesty offences committed by the accused against V1 and V2, including such acts as hugging, kissing the V1 and/or V2 on their cheeks and lips, and the touching of the various parts of their anatomy, including the breasts of V1 and V2 in the case of the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> charges. The fact that V1 and V2 are vulnerable because of their mental disability, and the deliberate exploitation by the accused of their vulnerability, as well as the apparent planning involved especially for the offences that took place on the later date i.e. on 24 November 2018, were all offence specific factors that apply based on the <em>Kunasekaran</em> framework. I thus agreed with the Prosecution that all the outrage of modesty offences fell within Band 2 of the framework. Further, where the outrage of modesty offence involved the touching of the breasts, caning should also be imposed in line with the decision in <em>Chow Yee Sze</em>, as affirmed in <em>Kunasekaran.</em></a></p><a id="p1_146"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a><a id="p1_147">147&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to the offender specific factors, I note that the <em>Kunasekaran</em> framework is meant to apply to offenders who claim trial. In this case, the accused is also a first offender. However, while the Prosecution alluded to the accused’s conduct in trial as being an aggravating factor, I note that the accused was, at first glance when he gave his statements in particular his first statement P2, relatively co-operative in that he admitted to the acts that are the subject matter of the charges against him.
