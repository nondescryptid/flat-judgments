He would look at the interviewer for a couple of seconds before closing his eyes and seemed to fall asleep. He would open his eyes and make eye contact when his name was called by the interviewer, then close his eyes again.

While the accused initially verbalised his thoughts that the interview would not help him in any way given his past experiences, the accused grew in his responsiveness to questions, made good eye contact, and required little prompting for elaboration.

While he continued to associate with friends whom he knew during his incarceration as a youth, he reported that they have desisted from offending, were married, and advised him to do the same. The accused also had a group of childhood friends who were prosocial, supported him when he needed assistance such as raising bail, and who advised him to change, to which he would acknowledge. According to his wife, he socialised mainly within the home context, where she would be present.</a></p><a id="p1_34"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the antisocial peer group, the accused appeared to have had friends who introduced him to methamphetamine during his most recent time in the community and to contacts who sold the drug, leading to his current trafficking and consumption charges. His association with these drug-taking friends, including his elder brother who took drugs, resulted in him continuing his drug consumption and incurring more drug-related charges.</a></p><a id="p1_35"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused and his wife’s account suggested that his free time after work was spent mostly within the home context, where they socialised with neighbours over meals and music, or with his wife chatting and watching television programmes or movies.

While he was convicted of a drug consumption charge resulting in his second PD sentence, he said that it was from a spiked drink laced with methamphetamine. The accused reported intentionally consuming methamphetamine in 2018 after being discharged from urine supervision upon introduction by a friend. He enjoyed its effects as it made him feel “energetic”.</a></p><a id="p1_38"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would consume the drug daily at a friend’s place (they lived in the same block) before going to work. His consumption reportedly increased over time, up until about 1-2g per day. When he could not obtain the drug, at times on weekends, he would experience being “sian” (without energy) and would replace it with alcohol instead. The accused and his wife’s account indicated that his wife was unaware of his drug taking habits until he was arrested in 2019, as it did not appear to interfere with their couple life and daily activities.</a></p><a id="p1_39"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a><a id="p1_40">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused reported a history of alcohol use, with him socialising with friends over meals and drinks at his place and at home after his release in the community in 2017. The accused said that after being dependent on prescribed drugs during his second PD sentence, he turned to alcohol as a substitute upon release. This enabled him to complete his urine supervision and be successfully discharged after 11 months. According to the accused’s wife, she was fully aware of his alcohol intake as part of his daily routine where she was often present, and she observed no noticeable changes in behaviour. His drinking, appeared to be linked to his trespass offence in April 2019, where he visited his mother and upon discovering she was not at home, attempted to enter the flat through climbing in from the outside. The accused said that as he had consumed alcohol prior, he mistakenly entered a neighbour’s flat instead of his own and was fined.</a></p><a id="p1_40"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a><a id="p1_41">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused presented with problems of adjustment in childhood, given his reported childhood trauma due to witnessing repeated physical abuse towards his mother and brothers, his running away from home in Primary Six, being placed in a Boy’s Hostel and subsequently a Boy’s Home after he ran away from the former. His criminal record reflected this last incident as a probation sentence at the age of 14 years old.</a></p><a id="p1_41"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a><a id="p1_42">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused also presented with charges of voluntarily causing hurt and institutional offences of self-inflicted harm. By his account, it appeared that he frequently reacted with violent behaviours when experiencing strong emotions of, for instance, frustration. He said that the physical pain of self-inflicted injuries helped him cope with his emotional pain, for example, during times where he was kept alone in a cell.</a></p><a id="p1_42"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a><a id="p1_43">43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last two years in remand, the accused was observed to not display any of these behaviours or be charged for such institutional offences. He reported that apart from taking prescribed medications, he engaged in daily meditation and prayer, which he found helpful in managing his emotions.</a></p><a id="p1_43"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a><a id="p1_44">44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused presented with some minimization of his offences, in terms of him not being the one to have printed out the wedding cards with the word “Sarajumbo”, and him claiming not to know that trafficking of methamphetamine could potentially lead to a capital charge. The accused alluded to “not thinking” when he pursued his drug habit and said that did not think he would be apprehended one day. Pertaining to the secret society “Sarajumbo” which he had founded, while others had started to follow him during the time where gangs were commonplace in 1996, he said that it naturally become inactive during his second PD sentence as prisons had improved over the years and there were systems to keep inmates safe. He appeared to have thought the word was inconsequential on the printed wedding card, given this context, and did not pay much heed given that the card had many other words on it.</a></p><a id="p1_44"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a><a id="p1_45">45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused appeared to have adopted a positive shift in many pro-criminal attitudes; he reported that he used to think he was a “hero” but reflecting on the years past, he felt that he had wasted his life away. While he had his mother visit him over the many incarcerations, he said that this time around with his marriage, he had impacted another - his wife and her life. In relation to substances, he hoped to reduce reliance on current prescribed medications and be weaned off them eventually.</a></p><a id="p1_45"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a><a id="p1_46">46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused displayed conventional attitudes as he regularly engaged in work, fulfilled his role as a husband by supporting his wife and taking care of the household, planned to study if given the opportunity, and was open to any intervention programmes, which he reported to have not received during his earlier sentences.</a></p><a id="p1_46"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Risk Findings</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a><a id="p1_47">47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on Singapore’s norms, the accused’s LS/CMI score placed him in the Moderate Risk/Need level of criminal re-offending. He belonged to a group of prisoners with a 30% probability of recidivism within 2 years of release.</a></p><a id="p1_47"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a><a id="p1_48">48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PSR stated that based on available sources of information, the accused presented with strengths in the areas of access to prosocial resources in the form of his wife and friends and ability to engage in regular employment. These protective factors appeared to facilitate him being in the community for the longest period of 2 years 7 months and also adopt the prosocial identity and role of a partner to his wife.</a></p><a id="p1_48"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a><a id="p1_49">49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PSR concluded that the accused presented with a moderate risk/need level of criminal re-offending. This appeared to be contributed primarily by his long history of offending, and drug and alcohol use contributing to law violations.</a></p><a id="p1_49"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Clarification sought on the pre-sentence report</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a><a id="p1_50">50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 28 December 2022, the court sought the following clarification on the PSR, with which both the Prosecution and Defence concurred:</a></p><a id="p1_50"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">In Part VIII of the report, it is stated that “Karnan [the accused] presented with a moderate risk/need level of criminal re-offending. This appeared to be contributed primarily by his long history of offending, and drug and alcohol use contributing to law violations.” To clarify, what are the specific risk factors which may be associated with Karnan’s [the accused’s] risk of re-offending?</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a><a id="p1_51">51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 18 January 2023, the Singapore Prisons Service replied as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_51"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">While Karnan [the accused] presented with attempts to lead a more non-criminal life in the past 2 years 7 months in the community, Karnan's [the accused’s] long history of offending continues to pose a risk to him because of criminal and drug-using acquaintances he has made over time and behaviours and attitudes that have become a part of his repertoire. Additionally, his history of using various substances (medication, alcohol and most recently methamphetamine) to either cope with emotions or to feel better presents another pathway back to crime.</p>

id="p1_52"></a><a id="p1_53">53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution submitted for the accused to be sentenced to PD for a term of at least 16 to 17 years.</a></p><a id="p1_53"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a><a id="p1_54">54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the technical requirements for PD were met, and the PSR had certified that the accused was fit to undergo PD, the Prosecution submitted that it was expedient to sentence the accused to PD, having regard to his lengthy history of offending, the seriousness of the present offences, and the substantial risk of future offending.</a></p><a id="p1_54"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a><a id="p1_55">55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, the Prosecution submitted that PD should be imposed for the following reasons:</a></p><a id="p1_55"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a><a id="p1_56">56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the accused’s antecedents showed that he was a habitual and recalcitrant offender, who has continued offending undeterred by lengthy sentences. As observed in the PSR, the accused has a history of offending dating back 42 years. His offences included serious property offences (vandalism, robbery with hurt) and violence offences (rioting, voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from his duty), as well as drug offences (possession and consumption of a controlled/specified drug).</a></p><a id="p1_56"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a><a id="p1_57">57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused was previously sentenced to 7 years’ PD with caning in 2000 and 8 years’ PD in 2009. It was particularly concerning that these lengthy periods in custody had not deterred the accused from further offending. Indeed, by engaging in drug trafficking where he had previously been convicted of drug possession and consumption, the accused has demonstrated an <em>escalation</em> in offending behaviour in spite of the previous sentences of PD.</a></p><a id="p1_57"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a><a id="p1_58">58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused had tended to turn back to crime after release from prison. For example, having been sentenced to 7 years’ PD in March 2000, he was sentenced again in 2007 for committing a hurt offence while in prison, before receiving a further sentence of PD in 2009. The PSR discloses that the longest period he spent in the community was from March 2017 to October 2019, being 2 years’ and 7 months. In the context of his antecedents, the Prosecution submitted that this was not to be regarded as a substantial period of time.</a></p><a id="p1_58"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a><a id="p1_59">59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the present offences were serious and supported the assessment that the accused was a hardened offender and a menace to the public.</a></p><a id="p1_59"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59"></a><a id="p1_59-p2_a">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trafficking charge. The supplying of controlled drugs in Singapore was clearly a serious harm to the public, which warrants a tough deterrent stance: <em>Vasentha s/o Joseph v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18022-SSP.xml')">[2015] 5 SLR 122</a> at [7]-[13] (“<em>Vasentha</em>”). In the present case, the accused possessed a substantial quantity of methamphetamine (not less than 166.99g) for the purposes of trafficking. It was further aggravating that he had taken to trafficking to sustain his drug consumption and had attempted to escape from officers in the course of his arrest.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_b">b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consumption and possession charges. The accused consumed methamphetamine on or before 3 October 2019 and 18 November 2020. The second occasion of consumption was committed while he was on court bail which also included the possession charge, further demonstrating the accused’s inability to stay away from drugs.</a></p><a id="p1_59-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_59-p2_c">c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret society charges. The accused has also admitted to membership of a secret society (of which he was the Senior Member and Founder) and affirmed his association with the secret society by printing its name on his wedding invitations.</a></p><a id="p1_59-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_60">60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the accused had a substantial risk of future offending. The PSR discloses an assessment of the accused to have a Moderate Risk/Need level of criminal reoffending, with a 30% probability of recidivism within 2 years of release. His drug use was identified as a contributor to this risk. The Prosecution submitted that the 30% probability remained significant and did not preclude a finding that PD was appropriate: see <em>PP v Iskandar bin Tahar</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20843-SSP.xml')">[2017] SGDC 266</a>, where the offender similarly had 30% probability of recidivism within 2 years of release and PD was nonetheless imposed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61">61&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was doubtful whether the accused was truly remorseful for his actions. Despite being caught red-handed in possession of the drugs, the accused did not confirm an intention to plead guilty until after the Case for Prosecution had been served. Consistent with this, the PSR disclosed that the accused presented with some minimisation of his offences, noting his allusion to “not thinking” when he pursued his drug habit and claiming that he did not think he would be apprehended.</a></p><a id="p1_61"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a><a id="p1_62">62&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the PSR disclosed some protective factors, such as his relationship with his wife and regular employment, these appeared to be of limited efficacy in preventing the accused from reoffending. Indeed, it was noted in the PSR that the accused’s wife was <em>unaware</em> of the accused’s drug taking habits, suggesting that the accused had taken steps to conceal such habits from her.</a></p><a id="p1_62"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a><a id="p1_63">63&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having regard to all the circumstances, the Prosecution submitted that it was expedient for the protection of the public that the accused is kept in custody for a substantial period of time.</a></p><a id="p1_63"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a><a id="p1_64">64&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the escalation in offending, and the ineffectiveness of the previous periods of PD in deterring the accused from offending, the Prosecution submitted that a substantial uplift was warranted for the protection of the public.</a></p><a id="p1_64"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a><a id="p1_65">65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, the Prosecution submitted that the length of PD should not be less than the imprisonment term which the accused would receive had he been sentenced to regular imprisonment (for which the consideration of protecting the public was tempered by other considerations): see <em>PP v Kamis bin Basir</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29109-SSP.xml')">[2022] SGDC 297</a> at [39].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66">66&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, the Prosecution submitted that the following sentences would have been imposed on the accused:</a></p><a id="p1_66"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66"></a><a id="p1_66-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the trafficking charge, a sentence of at least 16 years’ imprisonment would have been appropriate. Applying the conversation rate in <em>Loo Pei Xiang Alan v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18099-SSP.xml')">[2015] 5 SLR 500</a> (“<em>Loo Pei Xiang Alan</em>”) at [17] to the sentencing ranges in <em>Vasentha</em> at [47], the indicative starting sentence for trafficking in 166.99g of methamphetamine would be 15 years’ imprisonment and 11 strokes of the cane. Having regard to the aggravating factors, and given his antecedents, an uplift of at least 1 year would be appropriate.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the enhanced consumption charge, the minimum sentence of at least 3 years’ imprisonment would have been sufficient.</a></p><a id="p1_66-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_66-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the enhanced possession charge, the minimum sentence of at least 2 years’ imprisonment would have been sufficient, given the small amount (0.67g) of methamphetamine involved.</a></p><a id="p1_66-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_66-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Societies Act charge, a sentence of at least 3 months’ imprisonment would have been appropriate. In <em>PP v Muhamad Naqiuddin Khan Bin Jhangir Khan and ors</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26895-SSP.xml')">[2021] SGDC 269</a> at [22] and [67], the court observed that the precedents indicated a sentencing tariff of about 3 months’ imprisonment for offences under section 14(3) Societies Act, where there had been long years of membership of higher participation in the society’s activity. In the present case, the accused held the position of Senior Member and Founder and had printed his Society’s name on his wedding invitations.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67">67&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution accordingly submitted for term of at least 16 to 17 years’ PD.</a></p><a id="p1_67"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a><a id="p1_68">68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the backdating of the term of PD, the Prosecution acknowledged that section 318 CPC was amended (with effect from 31 October 2018) to specifically allow for the backdating of sentences of corrective training or preventive detention. Nonetheless, the Prosecution submitted the observations on backdating by the Court of Appel in <em>PP v Rosli bin Yassin</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 2 SLR 0831.xml')">[2013] 2 SLR 831</a> (“<em>Rosli</em>”) at [201] were still relevant:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Given the overarching principle to protect the public, if, in fact, the offender’s situation is an <em>extremely serious</em> one, then we would think that the court would <em>not</em> consider taking into account the time the offender has spent in remand. We think that this is likely to be the norm rather than the exception simply because, in principle, situations warranting a sentence of preventive detention are likely to be very serious to begin with. Indeed, in the <em>most extreme</em> situations, the court might not only disregard the time the offender has spent in remand but also sentence him or her to the maximum period of 20 years of preventive detention. However, as alluded to above, we would not rule out the exceptional situation where, whilst a sentence of preventive detention is warranted, there is nevertheless some justification for sentencing that offender to <em>less</em> time in preventive detention, which would, <em>inter alia</em> (and <em>in substance</em> at least), take into account the time the offender has already spent in remand.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69">69&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, the Prosecution submitted that it would not press the point in the present case that there should be no backdating of the PD term.</a></p><a id="p1_69"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Defence’s mitigation and submission on sentence </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a><a id="p1_70">70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence submitted that the real question that arose for determination before the court was whether PD was the only viable option towards the reformation of the accused.</a></p><a id="p1_70"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a><a id="p1_71">71&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referring to the PSR, the Defence submitted that when it was observed by the interviewer at the first interview that the accused was unable to communicate as he was dazed and appeared drowsy and sleepy, the Defence submitted that the accused along with several other prisoners were prescribed with sedatives to keep them ‘calm’ the whole day.</a></p><a id="p1_71"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a><a id="p1_72">72&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence submitted that the accused displayed positivity and was forthcoming despite despairing that it was ‘hopeless’ exercise but he then became responsive, respectful, verbalised and was forthcoming during then interview. He had shown respect towards the interviewer, did not decline to co-operate, or try to minimise or trivialise his offending as shown from what was presented in the PSR.</a></p><a id="p1_72"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a><a id="p1_73">73&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence contrasted the present case to that of <em>PP v Young Tat Ong</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29033-SSP.xml')">[2022] SGDC 278</a> (at [13]) (“<em>Young”</em>) where there the court therein found the offender to be unremorseful, was not only evasive but declined to answer some questions despite reminders. The offender in <em>Young</em> had tried to play the victim and portrayed himself as an innocent man. Further, he also offered a version that was inconsistent with the Statement of Facts that he had admitted to prior. He did not stop at there but was attempting to manipulate the interviewer to report that wanted an “honest living and that he did “no cheating or borrowing or anyhow take money”. In short, the offender in <em>Young</em> was totally unrepentant and showed no remorse whatsoever.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74">74&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, the PSR stated that the accused’s account and version to the interviewer was generally consistent with ‘other sources of information’ and hence their findings that the PSR was valid after doing an assessment in conjunction with first-hand observations during the interactions and this was a positive factor in the accused’s favour.</a></p><a id="p1_74"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a><a id="p1_75">75&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence submitted that unlike <em>Young</em>, the accused’s family and marital circumstances had some foundation that was a positive sign. He had attachments and was not disconnected as there was a family who stood by him. His current wife was very close to him. She was employed currently, and they stay at their own matrimonial HDB flat, and they knew each other since 2017. They got married in 2020 and the accused hoped to have children and start a family. She was a pillar of strength for him, and they spent much time together.</a></p><a id="p1_75"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a><a id="p1_76">76&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the accused was close to his mother and all along whilst he had been in remand to date, some 2 years or so, his wife and she had been an unfailing support and source of emotional support for him. They had been visiting him regularly and the accused had been greatly encouraged by their love and support and the PSR attested to the same. The accused had shown changes for the better. In fact, his conversion to Sikhism has wrought major changes in him where the tenet of Sikhism encourages the practice of self-restraint and respect for all. The Defence submitted that the accused was determined to be active member in the Sikh temple where he would help by cooking and serving food.</a></p><a id="p1_76"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a><a id="p1_77">77&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused’s low educational qualifications correlated to the kind of jobs that were available to him. In this regard, the accused hailed from a childhood background that was perilous and wrought with much pain and extreme hardship. He grew up in an environment that was far from ideal and could not be deemed as normal. His late father was an alcoholic who was violent and where physical violence was the order of the day. The accused experienced and witnessed incessant beatings with his mother attempting suicide on numerous occasions. As such, he never had a chance at decent education as studies were the first thing in the priority of things as far as his father was concerned.</a></p><a id="p1_77"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a><a id="p1_78">78&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this, there were positives recorded in the PSR. The accused held a regular job and enjoyed the work as a cleaning supervisor where his employer was pleased with his work rate and performance and additionally, he worked part -time helping out in delivery and was also in his spare time a handy man. He was not indolent during the material time in question and supported himself and his wife.</a></p><a id="p1_78"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a><a id="p1_79">79&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards to the companions he kept, a confluence of factors was at play. His childhood was severely marred by his stint in the Boy’s Home where he was both physically and psychologically abused and it was a negative life changing experience for him. He graduated at a fast pace in that toxic harsh environment where the conditioning was based on gang related activities – which was the norm and rule of the day. The release from there when he turned 8 years of age was another step into the harsh realities of society that did not welcome delinquents – and one he faced when so ill-equipped to deal and cope with. The only solace hereafter was finding comfort amongst ‘friends’ who were from the same stock – ex Boy’s Home inmates. The journey in life was not a bed of roses for him as it was one hurdle and other in finding any purpose and meaning in life. He made no excuses for the past and has paid the price.</a></p><a id="p1_79"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a><a id="p1_80">80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PSR reported that the accused had disassociated away from past friends who were into the pubbing culture, and he was discerning where he was listening to his childhood friends who were married and had started a family and he had their support, and he was forging a close relationship with his wife – his newfound social nexus.</a></p><a id="p1_80"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a><a id="p1_81">81&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence acknowledged that the accused’s mistake was that he was misled by a couple of his antisocial peers who made the mistake of introducing him to smoking methamphetamine where he was addicted to and committed the current drug offences. Further his elder brother who was a lifelong drug addict had influenced him to consume ice. That said, the Defence submitted that the accused’s conduct and ensuing harm was “self-destructive” to him and not a danger to the public.</a></p><a id="p1_81"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a><a id="p1_82">82&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence submitted that the accused also had good friends who had not given up on him and believed that the accused had good traits as to his character since childhood days and was capable of successful going straight if he was given a chance this time and to this end the Defence enclosed a letter from one such friend (Jeffrey Louis) which attested to the same. In the last 2 years in remand, the accused had changed for the better and had not displayed behaviours of such nature or been charged such and he has relied on religion of Sikhism where he meditates and prays daily.</a></p><a id="p1_82"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a><a id="p1_83">83&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence submitted that it was apparent that the accused’s dependence on alcohol and drugs were intertwined given his history where it was reported since his youth he was led astray on heroin and marijuana which he did not really enjoy. It was for a singular offence of consuming ice where he was given 8 years PD. His present offending was escalated by his higher than normal dependence on ice. As regards alcohol dependence, the PSR stated that his dependence on it was a substitute to keep him off drugs where he managed to complete his urine supervision.</a></p><a id="p1_83"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a><a id="p1_84">84&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the PSR which stated that despite some minimization on his part, the accused appeared to have adopted a positive shift in many pro-criminal activities. This internalization and self-realization were important for it showed a new insight into him.

The court will look at the <em>totality</em> of the offender’s previous convictions. (see the Singapore High Court decision of <em>Tan Ngin Hai v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2001] 2 SLR(R) 0152.xml')">[2001] 2 SLR(R) 152</a> at [7]).

As Yong CJ explained in <em>Public Prosecutor v Perumal s/o Suppiah</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2000] 2 SLR(R) 0145.xml')">[2000] 2 SLR(R) 145</a> at [38]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">In this regard, I must reiterate my earlier exhortation in <em>PP v Wong Wing Hung</em> … at [10] not to confuse the concept of preventive detention and imprisonment, which are distinct sentences and are underpinned by different objectives and rationales. The former is essentially aimed at the protection of the public while the latter reflects the traditional policies of prevention, deterrence, rehabilitation and retribution. They are different in duration, character and implementation. As such, it would be a mistake to view them as fungible sentences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97">97&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the accused’s long list of antecedents starting from 1980 since he was 14 years of age, there was no doubt that the accused was a habitual offender. In this regard, the PSR noted that the accused presented with an offending history of 42 years. His conviction history included serious property offences (vandalism, robbery with hurt), violence offences (rioting, voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty, voluntarily causing grievous hurt, wrongful confinement and offences related to scheduled weapons) and drug offences (possession and consumption of controlled/specified drug) for which substantial terms of imprisonment and caning had been meted out.</a></p><a id="p1_97"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a><a id="p1_98">98&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was especially significant was that the accused has previously served <em>two terms of PD</em>, namely 7 years PD in 2000 with caning for drug related and violence related offences; and 8 years PD in 2009 for a drug related offence. When imposing the second PD term in 2009 in <em>PP v Karnan s/o Arummugam &amp; Anor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/61776-M.xml')">[2009] SGDC 136</a>, the District Judge observed at [127]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">There was in this case no doubt, from the antecedent record of the accused, that he is an incorrigible and recalcitrant offender.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99">99&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present offences were committed in 2019 and 2020, some 2 years 7 months after he was released from his 2<sup>nd</sup> PD term.

The PSR stated that from the accused’s antisocial peer group, the accused had friends who introduced him to methamphetamine during his most recent time in the community and to contacts who sold the drug, leading to his current trafficking and consumption charges. His association with these drug-taking friends, including his elder brother who took drugs, resulted in him continuing his drug consumption and incurring more drug-related charges.</a></p><a id="p1_100"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a><a id="p1_101">101&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PSR clarification report stated that the accused’s long history of offending continued to pose a risk to him because of criminal and drug-using acquaintances he has made over time and behaviours and attitudes that have become a part of his repertoire. Additionally, his history of using various substances (medication, alcohol and most recently methamphetamine) to either cope with emotions or to feel better presented another pathway back to crime.</a></p><a id="p1_101"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a><a id="p1_102">102&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused had continued his association with his antisocial peer group <em>even after</em> he was charged in court on 4 October 2019. To this end, the Societies Act offence (10<sup>th</sup> charge) for which he was convicted showed that he was a member of the Sarajumbo Secret Society until 21 August 2020, for which the accused held the position of “Founder” and “Senior Member”, having founded the Society in 1996. Further, the Statement of Facts stated that he had printed the Society’s name under his name on 20 invitation cards to his wedding in his possession on 21 August 2020 (11<sup>th</sup> TIC charge), to show the pride in the gang he had founded.</a></p><a id="p1_102"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a><a id="p1_103">103&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noted from the PSR that the accused presented with some minimization of his offences, in terms of him claiming not to know that trafficking of methamphetamine could potentially lead to a capital charge. The accused alluded to “not thinking” when he pursued his drug habit and said that he did not think he would be apprehended one day. Further, while he was convicted of a drug consumption charge after trial which resulted in his second PD sentence in 2009, he said that it was from a spiked drink laced with methamphetamine. However, his appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed by the High Court. Pertaining to the secret society “Sarajumbo” which he had founded, while others had started to follow him during the time where gangs were commonplace in 1996, he said that it naturally become inactive during his second PD sentence. He claimed to not being the one to have printed out the wedding cards with the word “Sarajumbo”, and appeared to have thought the word was inconsequential on the printed wedding card and did not pay much heed given that the card had many other words on it.</a></p><a id="p1_103"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a><a id="p1_104">104&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For protective factors, the PSR stated that the accused presented with strengths in the areas of access to prosocial resources in the form of his wife and friends and the ability to engage in regular employment. These protective factors appeared to facilitate him being in the community for the longest period of 2 years 7 months and also adopt the prosocial identity and role of a partner to his wife. That said, in the context of his 42 years of criminal offending, I agreed with the Prosecution that a period of 2 years 7 months could not be regarded as a substantial period of time.</a></p><a id="p1_104"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a><a id="p1_105">105&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Significantly, I noted that the PSR stated that the accused and his wife’s account indicated that his wife was <em>unaware of his drug taking habits</em> until he was arrested in 2019 as it did not appear to interfere with their couple life and daily activities. This suggested that the accused had taken steps to conceal his drug-taking habits from her as she was quite oblivious of his drug activities despite being the person closest to him. This was even though he was consuming drugs on a daily basis at a friend’s place in the same block before going to work. In my view, his wife, prosocial friends or the fact of regular employment had little influence on preventing the influence of the accused’s antisocial peer group and his elder brother which led to his drug related offences, including some which would committed while on court bail. Simply put, these protective factors were of limited effectiveness in preventing the commission of current offences.</a></p><a id="p1_105"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a><a id="p1_106">106&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current offences for which the accused has been convicted were serious ones which included trafficking of a significant amount (166.99g) of methamphetamine together (maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane) with the enhanced consumption and enhanced possession charges (maximum of 10 years’ imprisonment and/or fine of $20,000) and Societies Act charges (maximum of 3 years’ imprisonment and/or fine of $5,000). While the total amount of methamphetamine in A1A, A1B and A1C1 was found to be more than 166.99g of methamphetamine, the Prosecution had proceeded in the 1<sup>st</sup> charge of trafficking of not less than 166.99g of methamphetamine.</a></p><a id="p1_106"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a><a id="p1_107">107&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence had highlighted the accused’s conversion to Sikhism as an example for the accused’s possible reform. In my view, the fact remains that the conversion by the accused to Sikhism in prison took place in a closed environment and had yet to be tested against external influences such as the accused’s anti-social peer group. In any event, while his conversion to Sikhism had been documented in the PSR, it was not highlighted as a significant protective factor in his favour.</a></p><a id="p1_107"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a><a id="p1_108">108&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I disagreed with the Defence’s submission that the accused’s conduct was self-destructive and did not pose a threat to others or a harm to society. It should be noted that his second PD term was imposed for an offence of consumption, and this was upheld by the High Court on appeal. As noted by Yong CJ in <em>Tan Ngin Hai v PP</em> [2001] 3 SLR 161 at [8], offences of drug possession and consumption can attract a PD term:</a></p><a id="p1_108"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>In my view there is no rule of law which states that protection of the public necessarily refers to protecting them from physical bodily harm.

As such the imposition of preventive detention ought not to be restricted only to persons of violent behaviour as exhibited through the commission of violent crimes. <b>Instead the real test is whether or not the degree of propensity towards any type of criminal activity at all is such that the offender ought to be taken out of circulation altogether in order that he be not afforded even the slightest opportunity to give way to his criminal tendencies again</b>.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a><a id="p1_109">109&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agreed with the Prosecution that there has been an <em>escalation</em> in the accused’s behaviour from his previous drug related offences which were for possession and consumption given his current conviction for trafficking in not less than 166.99g of methamphetamine. The accused had also exhibited a blatant disregard for the law as the enhanced possession, enhanced consumption and Societies Act charges were committed while he was on court bail.</a></p><a id="p1_109"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a><a id="p1_110">110&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great harm occasioned by drug abuse and drug trafficking and the need to deal sternly with drug traffickers has been comprehensively set out by Menon CJ in <em>Vasentha</em> [7] to [11] as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_110"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>The drug problem is a scourge. The binds of addiction make it difficult for those ensnared to break free. Singapore has recognised the evils of drug abuse and enacted legislation to address the problem since the early part of the last century</b>. For instance, the Straits Settlements Deleterious Drugs Ordinance (No 27 of 1910) made it an offence to import, administer or possess any deleterious drugs such as diamorphine. In more recent times, legislation such as the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance (No 7 of 1951) and the Drugs (Prevention of Misuse) Act (Cap 154, 1970 Rev Ed) were passed to address the drug problem. These two pieces of legislation were the predecessors of the MDA which was enacted in 1973.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">At the second reading of the Misuse of Drugs Bill in 1973, Mr Chua Sian Chin, then Minister for Home Affairs, <b>explained that the tough penalties for traffickers were there by design in order to suppress the drug trade</b>.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">….</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>In 1975, the MDA was amended to provide even harsher penalties for drug traffickers.</b> The prescribed minimum and maximum sentences for trafficking in controlled drugs were adjusted upwards; and the death penalty was introduced for trafficking in more than 30g of morphine or 15g of diamorphine (commonly known as “heroin”).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Later, in 1977, Mr Chua Sian Chin clarified that the harsh penalties for drug traffickers were underpinned by considerations of both general and specific deterrence: Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (27 May 1977) vol 37 at cols 34–35.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>The MDA was subsequently amended several times to provide stiffer penalties for trafficking in controlled drugs such as cannabis mixture, methamphetamine (commonly known as “ice”) and ketamine (see Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act (Act 40 of 1993); Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act (Act 20 of 1998) and Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act (Act 2 of 2006)).</b> These amendments were necessitated by changes in the local and global drug situation (including the emergence of new synthetic drugs) and <b>they seek to ensure that we can continue to effectively curb drug abuse and drug trafficking in Singapore.</b></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a><a id="p1_111">111&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PSR’s assessment of 30% probability of recidivism on the part of the accused remained significant and did not preclude a finding that PD was appropriate. In <em>PP v Iskandar bin Tahar</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20843-SSP.xml')">[2017] SGDC 266</a>, the offender had a 30% probability of recidivism within 2 years of release and PD was nonetheless imposed. To this end, the PSR had identified the accused’s drug use as a contributor to this risk of recidivism which was in fact how the current set of offences (the majority of which were drug offences) came to be committed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112">112&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, I was of the view that risk factors significantly outweighed the protective factors in this case. As I had earlier noted, the protective factors of his wife. prosocial friends and regular employment were of limited effectiveness in preventing the influence of the accused’s antisocial peer group and his elder brother which led to his current drug related offences, including some which would committed while on court bail. The various Societies Act charges show that he continued to maintain his anti-social peer links despite his previous PD terms.</a></p><a id="p1_112"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a><a id="p1_113">113&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that he had previously served 2 PD terms which involved drug offences and taken with the escalation of the accused’s conduct to drug trafficking for the current offences, I found that there was a need to protect the public and it was expedient that a third PD term be imposed. I made this finding on the basis of the accused’s history of criminal behaviour, the circumstances and nature of the present offences as well as the risk of re-offending.</a></p><a id="p1_113"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a><a id="p1_114">114&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 304(2) CPC provides that once the court is satisfied that it is expedient for the protection of the public to impose a term of PD, it should do so unless it has special reasons for not doing so. Special reasons would generally refer to an accused’s physical and mental suitability for PD, and in any event, must be exceptional: <em>PP v Perumal s/o Suppiah</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2000] 2 SLR(R) 0145.xml')">[2000] 2 SLR(R) 145</a> at [41]. As the accused has been medically assessed to be fit to undergo PD, I did not find any special reasons for not imposing PD.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Duration of the PD term</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115">115&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I next considered the length of the PD term to be imposed on the accused.</a></p><a id="p1_115"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a><a id="p1_116">116&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, in <em>Ravindran</em> Hoong J held at [92] that the duration of the term of PD was guided by the extent to which the public requires protection from the offender.</a></p><a id="p1_116"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a><a id="p1_117">117&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Sim Yeow Kee v PP &amp; another appeal</em> [2016] 5 SLR 938 (“<em>Sim Yeow Kee”</em>) the High Court observed at [97] as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_117"> </a><p class="Judg-Quote-1"><a id="p1_117">In the context of PD [Preventive Detention], general deterrence and the social value in keeping a hardened criminal out of circulation provide a legitimate basis and operative justification for the application of this regime. Thus, we consider that considerations of proportionality would not apply rigorously in such circumstances. Here too, these considerations would have limited scope for displacing the imposition of a term of PD where such a sentence would otherwise be warranted. However, we reject the notion that it has no application whatsoever. We note that in <em>Tan Ngin Hai v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2001] 2 SLR(R) 0152.xml')">[2001] 2 SLR(R) 152</a>, the offender was sentenced to eight years’ PD for stealing coins amounting to $1.10 from a van. The court considered it appropriate to do so because it was satisfied that it was “dealing with” an offender who was “deeply” entrenched in the criminal way of life, as could be seen from his past convictions. With great respect, we find ourselves unable to endorse the view that the principle of proportionality is so wholly to be disregarded that incarceration for such duration can fairly be justified for the theft of a few coins.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118">118&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Sim Yeow Kee</em> stands for the proposition that considerations of proportionality would not be applied rigorously in terms of a PD term. In other words, a PD term may be considerably longer than the imprisonment term which the court would have been minded to impose if it was expedient for the protection of the public, having regard to the circumstances of the case. That said, proportionality should not be wholly disregarded when imposing a PD term and the court in <em>Sim Yeow Kee</em> expressed concern in a situation such as that in <em>Tan Ngin Hai v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2001] 2 SLR(R) 0152.xml')">[2001] 2 SLR(R) 152</a> where an 8 year PD term was imposed for the theft of a few coins.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119">119&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversely, in calibrating the duration of the PD, in my judgment the accused should not be receiving a PD term which was <em>less</em> than the regular imprisonment term which the court would have imposed in the absence of a PD term, as that would detract from the purpose of PD which was to protect the public. In <em>PP v Kamis bin Basir</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29109-SSP.xml')">[2022] SGDC 297</a> similar observations were articulated by the District Judge at [39]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The next factor that persuaded me that incarceration for seven to eight years would be insufficient has to do with the likely length of imprisonment, had the accused been sentenced to regular imprisonment. In the present case, I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that the likely length of sentence, had the accused been sentenced to a term of regular imprisonment, would have been around nine years. This would comprise the mandatory seven years’ imprisonment for the 2 Charge (and an argument may reasonably be made that the sentence for this charge should be higher than the mandatory minimum) and a term of two years’ imprisonment for the 1 Charge (bearing in mind the relevant offence-specific and offender-specific factors as well as the principle of escalation). <b>This broadly suggested that the appropriate length of preventive detention should not be less than nine years in any event. In the present case, incarceration for a period longer than the likely imprisonment term that would have been imposed was, in my judgment, justified because preventive detention, as established earlier, operates on a different penological basis. The imposition of a term of imprisonment would generally incorporate the consideration of proportionality. However, such a principle would not apply rigorously where preventive detention was concerned as the overriding consideration must be the need to protect the public: Kuah Teck Hin (at [21]).</b></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120">120&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, I proceeded to assess the likely imprisonment term which the accused would have received.</a></p><a id="p1_120"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a><a id="p1_121">121&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the trafficking charge, having regard to <em>Loo Pei Xiang Alan</em> at [17] trafficking in one gram of diamorphine was, all other things being equal, as culpable as one who trafficked 16.7g of methamphetamine.

Based on the Statement of Facts, there was no evidence to suggest that the accused was part of a syndicate.

All things considered, I was of the view that there should be a slight discount from the starting point of 15 years’ imprisonment and in my view, a sentence of 13 years’ imprisonment would be appropriate for the trafficking charge. The enhanced possession and consumption charges each carried minimum sentences of 2 and 3 years’ imprisonment respectively. The Societies Act charge would have carried an imprisonment term of 3 months, see <em>PP v Muhamad Naqiuddin Khan Bin Jhangir Khan and ors</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26895-SSP.xml')">[2021] SGDC 269</a> at [71].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126">126&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to s 307(1) CPC, at least 2 sentences of imprisonment would have to run consecutively and as such, the range of the imprisonment term which the accused was likely to have received would range of 13 years and 3 months’ imprisonment (if the imprisonment terms in the trafficking and Societies Act charges were to run consecutively) and 16 years’ imprisonment (if the imprisonment terms in the trafficking and enhanced consumption charges were to run consecutively). Given that the enhanced possession charge was committed on a different date from the trafficking charge while the accused was on court bail, I would have been minded to run the 2 years’ imprisonment term for the enhanced possession charge with the trafficking charge which would lead to global term of 15 years’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_126"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a><a id="p1_127">127&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, I was of the view that the PD term to be imposed should not be less than 15 years and that 15 years’ PD was sufficient for the protection of the public and not wholly disproportional given the accused’s history of offending, the circumstances and nature of the present offences as well as the accused’s risk of re-offending.
