There is similarly no need to rule on every one of the submissions of the parties. That said, the submissions and sub-issues are an important part of the overall tenor and entire context of the conduct of the parties that I must examine to determine whether a strong <em>prima facie</em> case of unconscionability is established.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In undertaking this examination, I am guided by Lee J’s observations at [21-22] of <em>CEX</em> that while some authorities appear to discuss the substantive allegations of breach of contract, ostensibly departing from the merits principles, they:</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-Quote-1"><a id="p1_14">“…simply stand for the proposition that if [the obligor] were able to demonstrate conclusively that there had in fact been no breach, then that would lend weight to its assertions that [the beneficiary] had acted unconscionably: <em>Leighton Contractors (</em>Singapore<em>) Pte Ltd v J -Power Systems Corp and another</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/60266-M.xml')">[2009] SGHC 7</a> at [9].

The court however, is not obliged to always draw this inference…”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In deciding whether there is a breach or whether the call is baseless as above, I am also guided by the decision of the Court of Appeal in <em>Eltraco International Pte Ltd v CGH Development Pte Ltd</em> [2000] 3 SLR (R) 198 at [32] that where there are genuine disputes between the parties, one is entitled to call upon a bond to protect one’s interest. I am also mindful of the high threshold for establishing unconscionability as per [21] of the decision in <em>BS Mount Sophia Pte Ltd v Join-Aim Pte Ltd</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 3 SLR 0352.xml')">[2012] 3 SLR 352</a> (“<em>Mount Sophia</em>”) where the Court of Appeal noted:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When determining if a strong <em>prima facie</em> case has been made out, the entire context of the case must be thoroughly considered, and it is only if the entire context of the case is particularly malodorous that such an injunction should be granted.

Any permit to carry out structural works granted lapses when the qualified person under ss 8 or 11 to supervise the building work ceases to be such. The High Court further ruled at [48] that the permits are not transferable and the specific procedure to appoint a replacement must be followed. As this was not done in <em>CEX</em>, the call was unconscionable as the developer was responsible for at least part of the delay by not appointing a replacement qualified person and it would be illegal to proceed with construction works without a valid permit for the project at the time of the call, as per [67], [68] and [71] of <em>CEX</em>.</a></p><a id="p1_17"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that the appointment of Mr Ho was not notified to the BCA and Mr Chia remained the Architectural QP on record as late as September 2022, I find on the authority of <em>CEX</em> that there is illegality leading up to the call on the performance bond. My finding is fortified by the unanswered question surrounding the capacity of Mr Chia to serve as Architectural QP prior to his replacement by Mr Ho, as his incapacity would lead to an even earlier lapsing of the BCA Permit. As counsel for the claimant has noted, Mr Chia has not filed any affidavit to address his capacity to serve and neither has the first defendant sought to rebut the claimant’s contention.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect, I see no merit in the contention of counsel for the first defendant that a BCA Permit was not needed when Mr Ho was appointed since structural works had already been completed. This contention is unsupported by any controlling authority and as submitted by counsel for the claimant, incongruent with the legislative intent and framework of the BCA 1989 highlighted at [9] of <em>CEX</em>, to have a qualified person for building works at all times, due to the important duties imposed on such qualified persons. Whether the structural works had been completed by then is also unclear.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also see no merit in the submission that the claimant is not entitled to challenge the appointment of Mr Ho since they did not raise any objections earlier. Firstly, there is no evidence that the claimant was aware of the irregularity in the appointment. Secondly, I am of the view that the claimant is entitled to assume that the statutory formalities would be adhered to by the first defendant whose duty it is to make the appointment.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for whether the Architect under the SIA conditions must also be the Architectural QP, I agree with counsel for the claimant that this is envisaged and required under the regulatory framework having regard to the legislative intent and framework mentioned at [19] above. The first defendant’s submission that this is permitted is also not supported by any controlling authority. That said, even if I am wrong on this and the appointment of Mr Ho for the purposes of the contract is valid, the unanswered question regarding the capacity of the Architectural QP remains, rendering the works illegal in light of s 8 (2) of the BCA 1989 that mandates the appointment of another qualified person if any qualified person becomes unwilling or unable to act, by reason of termination or any other reason. As there is no evidence of Mr Chia’s capacity to perform his role while residing at a nursing home, the validity of the BCA Permit prior to the appointment of Mr Ho is highly questionable, even if Mr Ho’s appointment as architect for the purposes of the contract is valid.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether there is material non-disclosure </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of material non-disclosure, I agree with counsel for the first defendant on the authority of the Court of Appeal decision in <em>Bintai Kindenko Pte Ltd v Samsung C&amp;T Corp and another</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23479-SSP.xml')">[2019] 2 SLR 295</a> at [80] that the claimants have failed to make full and frank disclosure when applying for the <em>ex-parte</em> summons for an interim injunction by:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not drawing the court’s attention to the contractual requirements for an extension of time;</a></p><a id="p1_22-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_22-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Claiming that the lift contractor was the first defendant’s contractor rather than the claimant’s nominated sub-contractor; and</a></p><a id="p1_22-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_22-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stating they were not aware that YY Architects was the Project Architect while omitting to include all correspondence with YY Architects following the appointment.</a></p><a id="p1_22-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duty to make full and frank disclosure is well established and clear, and the submission of the claimant that none of the non-disclosures would have affected the granting of the <em>ex-parte</em> interim injunction in view of the illegality misses the point and does not excuse non-disclosure. That said, the effect of the non-disclosure is mitigated to an extent by the fact that notice of the hearing was given to the first defendant who attended and contested the <em>ex parte</em> application for the interim injunction.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, as highlighted by counsel for the claimant, the court does have a discretion to continue or grant a fresh injunction if required by the justice of the case even if there was failure to make material full and frank disclosure as noted at [48] of the Court of Appeal decision in <em>Dauphin Offshore Engineering &amp; Trading Pte Ltd v The Private Office of HRH Sheikh Sultan bin Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan</em> [2000] 1 SLR (R) 117. In my view, the justice of the case calls for a permanent injunction and the non-disclosure is best addressed by an appropriate cost adjustment, rather than setting aside in the circumstances of our case.</a></p><a id="p1_24"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Other genuine disputes</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the remaining sub-issues and submissions concerning the causes of the delays, the entitlement of the parties to seek extensions of time, suspend and/or terminate the contract and claim liquidated and other damages, applying the merits principle, I am of the view that these are best left to arbitration. Given the conflicting positions of the parties and the equivocal nature of the evidence in support of the various contentions, I am unable to say with any clarity that one side is responsible for the breach and/or that the call was baseless. In this regard, I am inclined to find that they evidence a genuine dispute between the parties that would have ordinarily entitled the first defendant to make the call but for my findings in relation to unconscionability.</a></p><a id="p1_25"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons above, having considered the context of the case in its entirety, I find that while there are genuine disputes between the parties on several issues, there are also strong <em>prima facie</em> indications of illegality in the project administration and inconsistency in the stance of the first defendant that are particularly malodorous. These render the call on the bond unconscionable and warrant the grant of the injunction sought.</a></p><a id="p1_26"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will hear parties on costs.</a></p><a id="p1_27"> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"></a><p class="Footnote"><a id="p1_27"><sup></sup></a><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a>1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit of Claimant’s Director Ng Beow Hock dated 20 September 2022 (“1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit of NBH”) at pp 171.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit of NBH at pp 173.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit of NBH at pp 169.</p></div></content></html>
