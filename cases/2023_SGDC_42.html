Prior to the present consolidated suits (“the present suit”), they were engaged in another High Court lawsuit against each other over a failed project known as “Solvesam” which was a computer software for use in software asset management and computer systems. The parties had high hopes for the company which would own Solvesam to be listed on NASDAQ, a stock exchange in the United States of America but this did not happen. Both the High Court suit and the present suit shared similar background facts.</a></p><a id="p1_1"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the trial, I dismissed the plaintiff’s claim and allowed the defendants’ counterclaim. Being dissatisfied, the plaintiff has appealed against my decision. I shall now provide full grounds of my decision.</a></p><a id="p1_2"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The background on the parties’ business and personal relationship had been comprehensively covered in the Judgment of George Wei J (as he then was) in <em>Tan Swee Wan and another v Johnny Lian Tian Yong</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22010-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGHC 169</a>. I could do no better than to refer to Wei J’s Judgment covering the background facts of the parties.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some differences between the High Court suit and the present suit. These were the subject matter that formed the basis of the suits as well as the causes of action.</a></p><a id="p1_4"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the High Court suit, the defendants in the present suit sued the plaintiff in the present suit over contractual payments which the defendants felt that they were entitled to claim as funds had been raised for the project and the project was essentially on track to be listed. There were 3 alternative causes of action pleaded. The first cause of action related to a breach of an oral agreement entered into by the parties sometime in 2010. Another cause of action was fraudulent misrepresentation made by the plaintiff in the present suit to induce the defendants to enter into a subscription agreement that was entered into by the parties with Sirius Venture Consulting Pte ltd (“Sirius”) and Spring Seeds Pte Ltd (“Spring Seeds”) that had invested in Techbiz Frisman Pte Ltd (“Techbiz”) that developed Solvesam. The third cause of action was based on constructive trust in that the defendants were unhappy with the plaintiff as the latter did not apply the funds that had been raised in compliance with the common understanding between the parties.</a></p><a id="p1_5"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present suit, the parties sued each other for contributions made by them to satisfy a number of Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation (“OCBC”) and Standard Chartered Bank (“SCB”) bank loans taken out by the parties as directors and shareholders of Techbiz. I shall now briefly summarise undisputed background facts to facilitate better understanding of the present suit.</a></p><a id="p1_6"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 8 August 2001, the first defendant (“Swee Wan”) set up Techbiz which provided computer forensics services. In October 2001, the plaintiff (“Johnny”) became director and shareholder of Techbiz. This was followed by the second defendant (“Kelvin”) who in January 2002 also became director and shareholder of Techbiz. Around 2006 to 2009, Solvesam was developed as a product of Techbiz.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 23 December 2010, the parties set up Solvesam International Pte Ltd (“SIPL”) which was subsequently changed to SSI International Pte Ltd on 20 July 2011 (“SSI”) to further develop and market Solvesam. The idea was that once sufficient capital had been raised for Solvesam, the parties would procure Techbiz to transfer ownership and rights over Solvesam to SIPL and list SIPL on NASDAQ. With the defendants’ technical knowledge, it appeared that the defendants developed Solvesam and Johnny’s role was to source for funds from Chinese investors.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, further development of Solvesam was not successful and SSI was not listed on NASDAQ. Starting around June 2011, there was confusion and unhappiness regarding some online falsehoods posted on websites about Solvesam and the defendants were concerned that such falsehoods might result in a lawsuit by Microsoft China. However, Microsoft China did not launch a law suit. The relationship between parties deteriorated. The defendants had serious doubts about Johnny’s intention of developing Solvesam. On 4 July 2011, Kelvin resigned as director and COO of Techbiz. This was followed by Swee Wan’s resignation as director and CEO of Techbiz on 30 November 2011.</a></p><a id="p1_9"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the deterioration of the parties’ relationship, Techbiz had required funding to further develop Solvesam into a fully developed software asset management system so numerous bank loans from OCBC and SCB were obtained in 2008 and 2009. The present suit related to the personal guarantees given by the parties as directors of Techbiz to the banks to secure the loans. I have summarised the loans that formed the subject matter of the present suit in the 2 tables below.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a

version </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnny’s pleaded case was that he was claiming the sum of $101,905.40 from each defendant with interest as the defendants’ share of liability under two joint and several personal guarantees dated 18 February 2008 and 30 December 2010 made in favour of OCBC which were the Table 1 loans. OCBC had by way of their letters of 10 July 2012, 2 August 2012 and 3 August 2012 requested for payment of amount due and outstanding from Johnny.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there was no payment, the bank exercised its right of set-off on 3 occasions namely, 21 September 2012, 9 October 2012 and 30 October 2012 for the sum of $84,299.10 from Johnny’s OCBC accounts and Easicredit account. This was followed by a Statutory Demand to initiate bankruptcy proceedings on 28 March 2013 for the remaining sum of $219,880.98. On 24 April 2013, Johnny paid OCBC the full amount of $221,417.11 which comprised of the $219,880.98 plus costs on indemnity basis at $1,536.13. Hence, Johnny claimed that he had paid the sum of $305,716,21 for the Table 1 loans and he sought 1/3 contribution from each defendant amounting to $101,905.40 per defendant.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the counterclaim relating to the Table 2 loans, Johnny’s position was that he was not liable as section 6(b) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43) mandated that no action could be brought on a special promise to answer for the debt unless the promise was by way of some note or memorandum in writing signed by the party to be charged. He denied having expressly or co-guaranteed such payment in writing.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendants’ version</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendants denied that they were liable for Johnny’s claim as Johnny had come to court with “unclean hands” and Johnny’s conduct had caused Techbiz to collapse, leading to Techbiz’s default on the various bank loans. In the alternative, Johnny had waived his right to contribution from the defendants.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendants’ case was that Johnny’s conduct together with his associates, Tan Yeok Lim (“TYL”) and Lim Kwang Meng (“LKM”) caused Techbiz to default its loan obligations. Many instances of such conduct were pleaded. Amongst the key grievances that the defendants had were that Johnny and LKM had set up Inquiro Consulting Pte Ltd (Inquiro”) on 23 May 2012 and this company was a competing business. Johnny had betrayed the mutual trust and confidence in their business partnership by giving false online information on websites relating to Solvesam.</a></p><a id="p1_17"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was pleaded at [16] of the Defence and counterclaim that out of the US$20 million that Johnny was tasked to raise, only HK $33.2 million was transferred to SSI. As at April 2012, Techbiz had over $400,000 in account receivables including the amount of $240,291.24 owed by SSI to Techbiz was not collected. In addition, in May 2012, Johnny, TYL and LKM requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting of Techbiz held on 4 June 2012 to resolve cessation of Techbiz business. In June 2012, the 3 men also wrongfully caused the sale of Techbiz’s entire undertaking and property as tabulated in Annex A of the Defence and Counterclaim at a heavily subsidised price of $500. In December 2011, Johnny procured the transfer of the intellectual property of Solvesam owned by Techbiz to SSI (which was wholly owned by the plaintiff) without any consideration.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnny’s conduct caused the defendants to be suspicious of his activities. Subsequently, on 29 June 2011, both defendants resigned as directors of SSI and sold their shares in SSI to Johnny for $1 each.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendants did not dispute that the parties had signed the two joint and several guarantees dated 18 February 2008 and 30 December 2010 made in favour of OCBC. These two guarantees covered 3 loan facilities taken out by Techbiz for the Table 1 loans.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of a counterclaim, the defendants sued Johnny for payments that they had made to OCBC and SCB for the outstanding Table 2 bank loans. The defendants paid OCBC $77,868.67. The defendants paid SCB $110,000. This amounted to $187,868.66 which meant that each defendant had paid $93,934.33. The defendants claimed that as Johnny had breached the oral agreement made in 2010, he was liable to pay these amounts. Alternatively, as pleaded in [7A] of the Defence and counterclaim, both defendants were counterclaiming the sum of $62,622.89 against Johnny being his 1/3 contribution under the Table 2 loans and pursuant to an Indemnity Agreement made between the parties.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues to be determined</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues for determination were:</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="">Issue 1- In light of unclean hands defence, was Johnny entitled to claim equitable contribution for Table 1 loans?</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a><a id="">Issue 2- Pursuant to loan and further loan representations, did Johnny waive his right to equitable contribution for Table 1 loans?</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a><a id="">Issue 3- On construction of Clause 22 of the OCBC guarantees, did Johnny agree to waive his right to equitable contribution under Table 1 loans?</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a><a id="">Issue 4- Did Johnny agree to indemnify Kelvin for his liabilities as co-guarantor for Techbiz’s loans?</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a><a id="">Issue 5- As for Swee Wan’s counterclaim, did Johnny agree to share liability for Table 2 loans?</a></p><a id=""> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision of the court</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 1- In light of unclean hands defence, was Johnny entitled to claim equitable contribution under Table 1 loans? </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this issue, I found in favour of the defendants in that this was a valid defence. It would be unconscionable to allow Johnny to succeed in his claim against the defendants. In [225] of the High Court decision of <em>Hong Leong Singapore Finance ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd</em> [2007] 1 SLR (R) 292, to establish this defence, the undesirable behaviour in question must involve more than general depravity. It must have an immediate and necessary relation to the equity sued for; it must be a depravity in a legal as well as in a moral sense. The transaction must be so tainted that the taint has a necessary and essential relation to the contract which is sued upon.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the facts of this case, I found that Johnny had mismanaged Techbiz’s affairs thereby causing Techbiz to default on its loan obligations and triggering the enforcement of the personal guarantees. I shall elaborate on my findings in which I found Johnny’s conduct to be unconscionable.</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Techbiz had over $400,000 in the form of overdue account receivables as at 1 August 2012. This was the material time when Techbiz defaulted on its OCBC loan obligations but Johnny failed to actively pursue these overdue account receivables although he had taken over the conduct of the company by then and even proceeded to call a EGM on 4 June 2012 to cease Techbiz’s business.</a></p><a id="p1_25"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the overdue account receivable from SSI to Techbiz was $240,291.24<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a> in Invoice No TB 1011-026 dated 31 October 2011 with credit terms of 14 days and the amount outstanding to OCBC was $283,798. There was no evidence that the plaintiff, who had full control of SSI by 1 August 2012, made efforts to recover the large sum of $240,291.24 owed by SSI to Techbiz. In court, Johnny’s explanation was that he was not aware of this amount although the Techbiz accounts of overdue receivable as at 30 April 2012<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> clearly showed $240,291.24 was owed by SSI. Therefore, I did not find Johnny’s explanation credible.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, by Johnny’s own evidence, at [197] of his AEIC<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a>, he claimed that he had injected $120,000 by end May 2012 into Techbiz. It followed that if Johnny had also diligently collected the sum of $240,291.24 from SSI, the default of the OCBC loans could have been averted.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, Johnny had set up Inquiro Consulting Pte Ltd (“Inquiro”) on 23 May 2012 even before the EGM to cease Techbiz’s business was called on 4 June 2012. I found that the nature of Inquiro’s business was such that it was in effect a competing business with Techbiz. In an email to Swee Wan on 3 July 2012<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a>, the assets of Techbiz was confirmed to be sold to Inquiro for a mere $500 even though Techbiz owned Solvesam which the plaintiff believed to be product so valuable that the company which owned its rights (namely SIPL/SSI) warranted a listing in NASDAQ. Although the EGM on 4 June 2012 had made a resolution that Swee Wan was to review and agree first, the sale of the assets went ahead without Swee Wan’s review and consent. This was highly suspicious behavior on the part of Johnny. There was also no evidence that there were other comparative quotes obtained from possible potential buyers. These actions suggested that Johnny had intended to sacrifice Tecbiz in favour of Inquiro and this resulted in the OCBC loan default.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, Johnny had obtained over $600,000 director’s fees from SSI<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a> which was unchallenged in court. So he was in the position to prevent the OCBC loan default but he chose to let the default occur resulting in the trigger of the personal guarantees.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth, my view was that it was curious that Johnny being a savvy businessman, did not negotiate with OCBC to prevent the bank default. He would know about the possibility of negotiating with OCBC to put Techbiz under judicial management but there was no evidence of such an attempt having been made. Instead, there was ample evidence exhibited showing how he urged the law firm M/s Yeo-Leong &amp; Peh, which was acting for OCBC, to pursue the debt against the defendants and even pointedly requested through his then lawyer, M/s INCA Law, that bankruptcy proceedings be pursued against the defendants <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 2- Pursuant to loan and further loan representations, did Johnny waive his right to equitable contribution for Table 1 loans?</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnny testified in court that his representations as seen in his emails of 26 February 2011<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a> and 29 June 2011<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> in which he stated that he would be responsible for and pay back all invested amounts pertained only to the potential Microsoft lawsuit for false misrepresentations including those posted on the Universal Wide Investment Holdings website. As it turned out, Microsoft did not commence a lawsuit. In addition, Johnny’s position was that the key words “loan” and “indemnity” were not found in his emails of 3 July 2011, 26 June 2011 and 29 June 2011 in which he gave the defendants assurances that he would be responsible. In short, these were not representations that Johnny would be responsible for the loans such that he had waived his right to contribution from the defendants.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that Johnny had stated in his 29 June 2011 email that he would bear 100% responsibility for the Microsoft debacle as the chain of emails preceeding his email pertained to the Microsoft potential law suit. However, I found that in his email of 26 February 2011, Johnny had represented in [6] of this email to the defendants that he would be responsible and would pay back all invested amounts if Solvesam failed and did not “100% list”. All Johnny’s assurances should be read in the context that he failed to raise the necessary funds by October 2010 as promised resulting in the need to obtain the December 2010 OCBC loans. He felt the need to assure the defendants, who had the critical technical expertise to contribute to the Solvesam project and Techbiz, to continue to believe positively in him.</a></p><a id="p1_32"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I found that the Johnny had waived his right to equitable contribution for Table 1 loans from the defendants.</a></p><a id="p1_33"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 3- On construction of Clause 22 of the OCBC guarantees, did Johnny agree to waive his right to equitable contribution under Table 1 loans?</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having found in favour of the defendants for the first and second issues, there was no need for this court to determine Issue 3.</a></p><a id="p1_34"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now deal with the counterclaims of the defendants.

In the Court of Appeal decision in <em>Tribune Investment Trust Inc v Soosan Trading Co Ltd</em> [2000] 2 SLR (R) 407, where there is no written agreement, the existence of a contract is to be “culled” from written correspondence and contemporaneous conduct at the material time.</a></p><a id="p1_36"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying this principle to the facts of the present suit, I found that Johnny had orally agreed to indemnify Kelvin for the latter’s liabilities as co-guarantor for the OCBC and SCB loans. It was trite law that oral agreements were legally binding between parties.</a></p><a id="p1_37"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that after Kelvin’s resignation as director and COO of Techbiz, Johnny offered to Kelvin to buy his shares in Techbiz for $100,000. Johnny also promised to indemnify Kelvin against all his liabilities as co-guarantor for all Techbiz’s loans. On that basis, on 26 July 2011, Kelvin signed the shares transfer form and the plaintiff paid him $100,000 on 27 July 2011. It was Kelvin’s case that the Johnny had at 3 instances (January 2012, July 2012 and 31 December 2011) orally represented to Kelvin about this indemnity. I accepted Kelvin’s testimony on this score.</a></p><a id="p1_38"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, it would be illogical for Kelvin not to cover his potential liability through an indemnity from Johnny considering he had left Techbiz way before the loans default. This was because by the time he left Techbiz, relationship between Johnny and the defendants had turned sour and was full of distrust and suspicion. Therefore, I accepted Kelvin’s evidence that he would not have divested his shares if Johnny had not provided the indemnity for Techbiz’s loans as Kelvin would have missed out dividend payments once he had divested his shares.</a></p><a id="p1_39"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a><a id="p1_40">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this basis, I found the Johnny was not entitled to claim equitable contribution from Kelvin as Johnny had agreed to indemnify Kelvin for his liabilities as co-guarantor for Techbiz’s loans. It followed that since Johnny had provided such an indemnity, Kelvin would also be entitled to claim contribution from Johnny in respect of the sums that Kelvin had paid for the Table 2 loans. Hence, I awarded judgment in the sum of $93,934.34 with the usual statutory interest to be paid by Johnny to Kelvin as Johnny had provided a full indemnity.</a></p><a id="p1_40"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 5- As for Swee Wan’s counterclaim, did Johnny agree to share liability for Table 2 loans?</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a><a id="p1_41">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In court, the plaintiff’s counsel took the position that the defendants were put to strict proof that the defendants had each actually paid the amounts of $55,000 to SCB and $38,934.34 to OCBC which meant that each defendant had paid $93,934.34. Their position was that the defendants had not shown proof that such sums were paid.</a></p><a id="p1_41"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a><a id="p1_42">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that the contemporaneous letter dated 12 July 2013 sent by M/s Gateway Law Corporation stated clearly that such sums were indeed paid and were full and final settlement of any outstanding sums. As rightly pointed out by the defendants’ counsel, as there was final and full settlement of such loans, there had not been any lawsuit commenced in court against the defendants. Therefore, I agreed with the defendants that they had proven that they had indeed made such payments.</a></p><a id="p1_42"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a><a id="p1_43">43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To secure these Table 2 loans, the defendants signed one personal guarantee dated 8 May 2009 and 2 personal guarantees dated 9 April 2009. Johnny was not a guarantor under these 3 personal guarantees as according to the defendants, Johnny did not have an acceptable credit history at the material time.</a></p><a id="p1_43"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a><a id="p1_44">44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the undisputed factual matrix, all parties had stood as guarantors for Table 1 loans. But only for Table 2 loans which were the subject matter of the counterclaim, only the defendants stood as guarantors.</a></p><a id="p1_44"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a><a id="p1_45">45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendants’ explanation was that Johnny had unsatisfactory credit history in 2009. Johnny’s position was that it could not be due to Johnny’s unsatisfactory credit history as the lawsuit DC/DC 1624 of 2008 was concluded as of 12 September 2008 and Johnny had obtained judgment in his favour. The explanation by Johnny as to why he was not a guarantor for the Table 2 loans was because both banks did not require it.</a></p><a id="p1_45"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a><a id="p1_46">46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that for the Table 1 loans, based on the contemporaneous emails sent by OCBC, the bank’s practice was to require all directors and/or shareholders to stand as guarantors. I noted that the 2008 OCBC loan was for $80,000 and OCBC required all 3 men to stand as guarantors. As for the 2010 OCBC loan for $355,000, all 3 men similarly had to stand as guarantors. I found that it would be logical that the 2009 loans for a total of $645,000 which was a far larger sum, would also require all men to stand as guarantors. However, something must have happened in 2009 for OCBC and SCB to require only the defendants to stand as guarantors.</a></p><a id="p1_46"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a><a id="p1_47">47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without evidence such as documentary evidence or oral evidence from the banks and their officers, I was unable to definitively make the finding that the reason why the plaintiff did not stand as guarantor as suggested by the defendants was mainly due to Johnny’s unsatisfactory credit history. Nonetheless, the undisputed facts that stood before this court was that it was the defendants who stood as guarantors for Table 2 loans.</a></p><a id="p1_47"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a><a id="p1_48">48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that Swee Wan had proven that Johnny had provided an oral indemnity to him to share equal liability for the Table 2 loans. I shall elaborate.</a></p><a id="p1_48"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a><a id="p1_49">49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loans were taken out by Techbiz to further develop the Solvesam project especially since Sirius and Spring Seeds were exiting their involvement in the project and both Sirius and Spring Seeds had given notice for redemption of the RCPS shares on 8 September 2009 and 3 March 2009 respectively. It was undisputed that Johnny’s main role in the project was to raise funds as he did not have technical expertise to develop Solvesam. However, the fundraising efforts by Johnny appeared to Swee Wan to have hit a snag in that there was delay in having the funds raised. In order for Swee Wan to continue to have trust in him, Johnny made certain representations to Swee Wan. I found that these representations included representations to share equal liability for Techbiz’s loans. This would include the Table 2 loans.</a></p><a id="p1_49"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a><a id="p1_50">50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Johnny’s representations in his email of 26 February 2011, he had represented to Swee Wan that he would payback all invested sum if SolveSam did not succeed. I found that this representation included paying back on the personal guarantees for the Table 2 loans.</a></p><a id="p1_50"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a><a id="p1_51">51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention was for all parties was to apply for the Table 2 loans as was the practice for the 2008 bank loans but due to possible issue about Johnny’s credit worthiness, only the defendants were accepted by OCBC and SCB to be guarantors in the Table 2 loans. Even Johnny conceded during cross-examination that it was the usual practice of banks to require personal guarantees from key members of the company seeking bank loans. He also conceded that he was a key member of Techbiz. Further, the loans taken out during the material time were for expansion of Techbiz. My view was that given these concessions by Johnny, it was completely plausible for parties, who were the key members of Techbiz, to have come to an arrangements that there was an agreement to share lability. Hence, where Swee Wan was concerned, the intention was for Swee Wan and Johnny to assume equal liability for the Table 2 loans.</a></p><a id="p1_51"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a><a id="p1_52">52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, I found that Johnny had agreed to share equal liability for the Table 2 loans which amounted to $31,311,44 being 1/3 contribution from each party. As Swee Wan had paid $93,934.34 for the Table 2 loans, I awarded Swee Wan 1/3 of the payment which amounted to $31,311.44 with the usual statutory interest thereon.</a></p><a id="p1_52"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a><a id="p1_53">53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I dismissed Johnny’s claim and allowed the defendants’ counterclaim accordingly.
