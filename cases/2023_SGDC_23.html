Under the terms of the Performance Guarantee, the Defendant was thus obliged to make payment on the Plaintiff’s demand without question. In relation to the Defendant’s contention that the Performance Guarantee had been terminated as a result of an earlier Non-Renewal Letter dated 5 February 2021 sent by the Defendant pursuant to clause 3 of the Performance Guarantee, the Plaintiff’s position is that the said Non-Renewal Letter: (a) was not sent out by the Defendant, (b) was not received by the Plaintiff, and/or (c) was not brought to the Plaintiff’s notice.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, the Plaintiff contends that the Defendant has failed to prove that the Non-Renewal Letter was actually mailed to the Plaintiff and/or that the Non-Renewal Letter was actually received by the Plaintiff. In this connection, it is undisputed that the postal acceptance rule does not apply to the case at hand following the High Court decision of <em>1L30G Pte Ltd v EQ Insurance Co Ltd</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21245-SSP.xml')">[2017] 5 SLR 1106</a> (“<b><em>1L30G</em></b>”). Accordingly, mere proof that the Non-Renewal Letter was mailed to the Plaintiff is insufficient for the Defendant to avoid liability – it is necessary for the Defendant to prove that the Non-Renewal Letter was received by the Plaintiff. Plaintiff contends that there is insufficient proof that the Non-Renewal Letter was in fact received by the Plaintiff, or that the Plaintiff had actual notice of it. The Performance Guarantee was thus automatically extended at the end of each expiry period, and remained valid at the time of the Plaintiff’s Demand. The Plaintiff additionally claimed that the Defendant had failed to comply with the condition precedent for terminating the Performance Guarantee by failing to give the Plaintiff at least 90-days’ notice before terminating the Performance Guarantee.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defendant’s case</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant submits that the Plaintiff’s application ought to be dismissed as the Plaintiff’s demand on the Performance Guarantee was out of time and therefore invalid. The Defendant contends that pursuant to clause 3 of the Performance Guarantee, and by way of a letter dated 5 February 2021 sent by the Defendant to the Plaintiff by AR Registered post on 29 January 2021 (the “<b>Non-Renewal Letter</b>”)<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a>, the Defendant has given the Plaintiff the requisite 90-days’ written notice of the Defendant’s intention not to extend the Performance Guarantee upon its expiry on 5 May 2021. Although the Defendant’s letter was dated 5 February 2021, the Defendant asserts that it was in fact issued on 29 January 2021 and post-dated to 5 February 2021. This was to factor in time for the letter to be delivered to the Plaintiff so that the Plaintiff would receive the 90-day notice as required by the terms of the Performance Guarantee. The Defendant tenders a Yellow Card<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> endorsed by Singapore Post which purportedly shows that the Non-Renewal Letter was delivered to SICC on 2 February 2021.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant’s position is that since the Defendant has informed the Plaintiff of its intention not to extend the expiry date of the Performance Guarantee beyond 5 May 2021 via the Non-Renewal Letter, the Performance Guarantee expired on 5 May 2021. As the Plaintiff’s Demand was only made on 25 November 2021, the Defendant is not liable to the Plaintiff under the Performance Guarantee.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Procedural History</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should note that the Defendant had in the initial stages of the proceedings submitted that the Plaintiff’s application was wrongly commenced by way of an originating summons (“<b>OS</b>”) and ought to be dismissed outright.

Pertinently, the automatic extension and termination clause of the performance bond in <em>1L30G’s</em> case was almost word-for-word identical to the automatic extension and termination clause in Clause 3 of the Performance Guarantee in the present case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A point of distinction between <em>1L30G’s</em> case and the present case is that the notice of non-renewal in <em>1L30G</em> was sent by Registered Mail, whereas the Non-Renewal Letter in the present case was sent via Advice of Receipt Registered Mail (“<b>AR Registered Mail</b>”).

The plaintiff-beneficiary claimed not to have received the notice of non-renewal.</a></p><a id="p1_26"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>1L30G</em>, the issues which His Honour, Lee Seiu Kin J, had to consider were:</a></p><a id="p1_27"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27"></a><a id="p1_27-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the defendant-insurer posted the notice of non-renewal;</a></p><a id="p1_27-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_27-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether under clause 3 of the performance bond in that case, it was sufficient that the defendant-insurer had sent the notice of non-renewal by registered mail, or whether it was necessary for the plaintiff-beneficiary to have actually received the letter, <em>i.e.</em> whether the postal acceptance rule applied; and</a></p><a id="p1_27-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_27-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If clause 3 of the performance bond required actual receipt, whether the plaintiff-beneficiary actually received the notice of non-renewal.</a></p><a id="p1_27-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee J eventually found in favour of the plaintiff-beneficiary.

The court reasoned that the defendant-insurer only needed to show that the notice of non-renewal was sent to the plaintiff on a balance of probabilities. His Honour considered the fact that the defendant's affidavit evidence that the notice of non-renewal was the document posted out was not directly contradicted by the plaintiff, and was in fact supported by the registered mail receipt. This rendered it likely that the defendant-insurer did in fact send the notice of non-renewal to the plaintiff.</a></p><a id="p1_28-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_28-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second issue, Lee J found that clause 3 of the performance bond in that case was in effect a termination clause, as it allowed the defendant to give notice of non-renewal of the performance bond. The effect of any exercise of the right to terminate was, however, accompanied by the plaintiff-beneficiary’s rights to make an immediate claim on the performance bond, or to extend the performance bond by a final 180 days. Lee J found that as a matter of construction of the performance bond, the plain meaning of the word “notice” as used in clause 3 must mean that the other party must actually be informed, especially since the notice of non-renewal triggered various rights for the benefit of the plaintiff-beneficiary. In this connection, Lee J held that the postal acceptance rule did not apply. His Honour reasoned that the postal acceptance rule only applied in cases where both parties intended for it to apply. The contractual language in <em>1L30G’s</em> case was clear in indicating that the plaintiff-beneficiary must have actual notice of the notice of non-renewal in order to benefit from his entitlements under clause 3. The fact that clause 3 of the performance bond concerned termination rather than acceptance of contractual rights might also indicate that the parties did not intend the postal acceptance rule should apply.</a></p><a id="p1_28-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the court in <em>1L30G</em> held that clause 3 of the performance bond was “only satisfied when the plaintiff has actually received the notice of non-renewal whether by letter, fax, email or any other means. If the defendant chooses to use postal communication, <em>it assumes the risks that are associated with the post</em>” (at [35]) (<em>emphasis added</em>).</a></p><a id="p1_29"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the facts of <em>1L30G</em>, the court found that the plaintiff-beneficiary did not have actual notice of the notice of non-renewal:</a></p><a id="p1_30"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_30-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the court found that the defendant did in fact post out the notice of non-renewal based on the registered mail receipt, this was insufficient to prove that the plaintiff had actual notice of the document since the postal acceptance rule did not apply; and</a></p><a id="p1_30-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_30-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court found that the evidence supported the conclusion that the plaintiff had not received the notice of non-renewal. The plaintiff’s director’s affidavit evidence to this effect was consistent with the plaintiff’s conduct of asking a third party about the extension of the bond. This finding was also corroborated by the acts of two third parties who were copied on the notice of non-renewal. First, the party whose performance was guaranteed by the bond had filed for an injunction against the first demand on the bond on 5 June 2015, which it would not have done if it had received the 27 June 2014 notice of non-renewal: see <em>1L30G</em> at [11(c)]. Secondly, the plaintiff had also emailed the insurance broker on 12 December 2014 to enquire if the performance bond would be automatically renewed. Likewise, the plaintiff would not have bothered to make these enquiries if it had already received the 27 June 2014 notice of non-renewal and was apprised of the insurer’s intention to terminate the bond: see <em>1L30G</em> at [37] and [39].</a></p><a id="p1_30-p2_b"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The present case</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The holdings of <em>1L30G</em> are of significant precedential value in the present case as the auto-extension and termination clause in <em>1L30G</em> and the present case are almost completely identical.

I therefore turn to the main issues to be decided in the present case, namely: (a) Whether the Non-Renewal Letter was the document mailed out by the Defendant; and (b) Whether the Non-Renewal Letter was received by the Plaintiff such that the Plaintiff had actual notice of the Defendant’s intention not to renew the Performance Guarantee.</a></p><a id="p1_32"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the Non-Renewal Letter was the document mailed out by the Defendant</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a balance of probabilities, I find that the document that was mailed by the Defendant by AR Registered Mail on 29 January 2021 is in fact the Non-Renewal Letter.

As she had been working from home, she emailed the Non-Renewal Letter to her colleague Wong Jian Wei (DW4, “<b>Wong</b>”)) and requested the latter to print and thereafter to send the Non-Renewal Letter out by AR Registered Mail. Wong confirmed at paragraph 6 of his affidavit that upon receipt of the email from Kelly Ho, he printed the Non-Renewal Letter, folded the letter and placed it in a sealed envelope. He then arranged for the company’s dispatch staff to send the Non-Renewal Letter by AR Registered Mail to the Plaintiff. He stated that he subsequently received the Yellow Advice of Receipt Card (the “<b>Yellow Card</b>”)<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a> from Singapore Post.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DW2 Chionh Hock Siong (“<b>Chionh</b>”), the Defendant’s delivery dispatch staff, deposed that he was the person who went to the Shenton Way branch of Singapore Post on 29 January 2021 to arrange for the Non-Renewal Letter to be sent by AR Registered Mail to the Plaintiff. He exhibited at pages 29 to 31 of his affidavit dated 19 July 2022 copies of the Posting Form for Registered Services (“<b>Posting Form</b>”) which he had prepared before going to the Shenton Way post office on 29 January 2021. Item 7 of the Posting Form listed the Plaintiff’s name and address. A picture of the AR Registered Mail addressed to SICC purportedly containing the Non-Renewal Letter, with Reference Number RC126293202SG (the “<b>Reference Number</b>”), is included in the Defendant’s Supplementary Bundle of Documents (“<b>DSBD</b>”) at page 3. Chionh also exhibited at pages 29, 31 and 32 of his affidavit a copy of the Singapore Post (Shenton Way Branch) Transaction Receipt dated 29 January 2021, item 7 of which bore the Reference Number.

Hence, the mere fact that it has been shown that the Non-Renewal Letter has been posted by Defendant does not without more lead to the conclusion that the Plaintiff must therefore have received it. The burden of proof lies on the person alleging notice was given (<em>i.e.</em> the Defendant) to show actual communication of the Non-Renewal Letter to the Plaintiff: see <em>Ho Miaw Ling v Singapore Island Country Club</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1997] 1 SLR(R) 0640.xml')">[1997] 1 SLR(R) 640</a> at [20].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I preface my discussion of this issue by stating that I agree with the Defendant Counsel’s submission that receipt of the Non-Renewal Letter by an <em>employee</em> of the Plaintiff at the registered office is sufficient to constitute actual notice of the Non-Renewal Letter by the Plaintiff. There is no need for the Non-Renewal Letter to be served on, or be received by, any <em>particular</em> officer of the Plaintiff.

In the present case, the Plaintiff’s staff were consistent in stating that they did not actually receive the Non-Renewal Letter.</a></p><a id="p1_43"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plaintiff’s arrangement with Singapore Post for the collection of AR Registered Mail</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a><a id="p1_44">44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it became clear in the course of the cross-examination of the witnesses that the Plaintiff had an arrangement with Singapore Post, whereby the Plaintiff collected all of its mail (both ordinary and AR Registered Mail) from the Ang Mo Kio Post Office. Non-registered mail will be collected by the Plaintiff’s office attendants from the Plaintiff’s P.O. Box at Ang Mo Kio Post Office, and registered mail at the counter of Ang Mo Kio Post Office. This was confirmed by: (a) the affidavit evidence and witness testimony of the Plaintiff’s dispatch staff, <em>i.e.</em> Mr. Ming<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a> and Ms. Saemah<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>; (b) the affidavit evidence and witness testimony of the Plaintiff’s Director of Corporate Services, Ms. Rajita<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>; and (c) the correspondences exchanged between the Plaintiff and Singapore Post – <em>i.e.</em> the Plaintiff’s letter to Singapore Post dated 5 July 2022<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> and the email response from Singapore Post dated 11 August 2022 confirming this arrangement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>.

Thus, the Defendant’s evidence, in particular the Yellow Card, which on its face suggested that the Non-Renewal Letter had in fact been delivered to the Plaintiff’s registered address, is inaccurate.</a></p><a id="p1_45"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yellow Card</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a><a id="p1_46">46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The signed Yellow Card was also, in my view, insufficient to prove that the Non-Renewal Letter was received by the Plaintiff or brought to the Plaintiff’s actual notice.</a></p><a id="p1_46"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a><a id="p1_47">47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yellow Card in the present case was signed by a Singapore Post officer under the heading - <em>“The recipient has acknowledged receipt of the item on the delivery receipt but declines to sign this card”</em>. This had initially created the impression that the mail had in fact been delivered to SICC’s registered address by a Singapore Post officer and received by a SICC employee at the said address, who then declined to sign on the Yellow Card. However, as noted above, in light of the Plaintiff’s arrangement with Singapore Post, the Non-Renewal Letter would not have been delivered to the Plaintiff’s registered address. Thus, the Yellow Card did not, in and of itself, prove that the Non-Renewal Letter was in fact received by someone at the Plaintiff’s registered address.</a></p><a id="p1_47"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a><a id="p1_48">48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Yellow Card was also not signed by the Plaintiff’s dispatch staff to acknowledge collection of the Non-Renewal Letter at the Ang Mo Kio Post office. Singapore Post’s representative, Mr. Rajah Raman, testified during cross examination that since the COVID-19 pandemic, Singapore Post does not deliver AR Registered mail directly to the recipient’s doorstep, but instead delivers such mail to the recipient’s letter box at the relevant post office<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a>. All registered mail will then be handed to the recipient over the counter<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>. Mr Raman goes on to clarify that when an AR Registered Mail is handed over to a customer at the post office, Singapore Post will not ask the customer to sign on the Yellow Card. Instead, the counter staff will assist and endorse on the right-hand side of the Yellow Card when they hand over the item to the customer<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>. When it was put to him that it was strange that when collections were made in person at the counter, the Singapore Post staff would not ask for the customer’s signature to be affixed on the left-hand acknowledgement section, Mr. Raman admitted that it was strange<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49">49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This revelation has two implications: (a) first, the notation on the Yellow Card that “<em>the recipient has acknowledged receipt of the item on the delivery receipt but declines to sign this card</em>” is in fact factually wrong and misleading; and (b) despite the return of a signed Yellow Card to the Defendant, there was in fact no acknowledgement by a personnel from SICC that the mail was in fact collected personally by him/her.</a></p><a id="p1_49"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a><a id="p1_50">50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, Mr. Raman’s contention that the counter staff would not ask the customer to acknowledge receipt on the Yellow Card despite the customer collecting in person at the counter was in fact contradicted by the Plaintiff’s Mr. Ming and Ms. Saemah’s consistent testimonies to the effect that it was standard practice that they would be required to sign on the Yellow Card if the AR Registered Mail was in fact handed to them personally at the counter. In the present case, they confirmed that the Yellow Card did not bear their signatures, which in turn suggested that the mail was not collected by either of them.</a></p><a id="p1_50"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Lack of clarity and consistency as to who signed the Yellow Card </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a><a id="p1_51">51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with Plaintiff’s Counsel that, viewed as a whole, there was a lack of clarity and consistency in Mr. Raman’s evidence as to who from Singapore Post signed the Yellow Card, and under what circumstances. During his examination in chief, Mr. Raman stated that it was Singapore Post’s <em>counter staff</em> that will sign on the Yellow Card when the mail is handed over to a customer at the Post office<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a>. However, during cross examination, Mr. Raman contradicted his earlier testimony by stating that the Yellow card is signed off by “<em>either the delivery staff or the participating counter staff</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. Ultimately, Mr. Raman confirmed that he did not know for sure who signed on the Yellow Card and he was merely “guessing”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52">52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lack of clarity as to the person who affixed the signature on the Yellow Card highlights a more fundamental problem, namely the significant ambiguity as to the actual practice adopted by Ang Mo Kio Post Office with regards the transmission of AR Registered Mail to the end customer. In light of such ambiguity, I agree with Plaintiff’s Counsel that the mere fact that Yellow Card was endorsed by <em>someone from Ang Mo Kio Post Office</em> does not, without more, show that the Non-Renewal Letter must have been handed over to a representative of the Plaintiff. This is all the more so given the fact that the Plaintiff’s dispatch staff have deposed on affidavit that it is “standard practice” for them to sign on the Yellow Card (or copy thereof) to acknowledge receipt of any AR Registered mail collected by them. Their affidavit evidence was maintained under cross-examination and was not impeached. Indeed, as a matter of logic, if the AR Registered Mail was in fact collected by a SICC office attendant over the counter, there was, in my mind, no good reason why Singapore Post would not ask the collecting party to sign on the left hand potion of the Yellow Card to confirm receipt<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53">53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net effect of the testimonies of the different witnesses is that the probative value of the signature on the Yellow Card to prove that the AR Registered Mail was in fact delivered to the Plaintiff is significantly diminished.</a></p><a id="p1_53"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “Status Update: RC126293292SG” (the “Status Update”)</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a><a id="p1_54">54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant also relied on the status update produced by Singapore Post which purportedly showed that the Registered Mail was collected by SICC on 2 February 2021 (the “<b>Status Update</b>”)<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a>. Mr. Raman’s testimony was that the Status Update is a system-generated status report from Singapore Post’s own internal system which tracks the status of trackable mail items, by scanning a barcode on the mail, at each location from the time the mail item is lodged at the post office for posting until the time it is delivered to the recipient<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>. Row 2 of the Status Update states the mail item was “Collected by Customer” on 2 February 2021 at 09:00:00.000 hours.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55">55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A perusal of the Status Update however raised questions as to the accuracy of the data and information reflected in the Status Update. In particular, there are two entries in the Status Update – namely the entries described as (i) “received by AMK Post Office” and (ii) “collected by customer” – which reflected the exact same timing of 9.00am sharp down to the second and millisecond. Construed literally, the Status Update showed that the Registered Mail arrived at and was scanned by Ang Mo Kio Post Office on 2 February 2021 at 09:00:00.000. It was thereafter purportedly collected by the customer (SICC) at 09:00:00.000 on the same day as well. I accepted Plaintiff’s Counsel’s submission that it was highly improbable that both the receipt of the Registered Mail at the Ang Mo Kio Post Office from the distribution base, and the collection by the customer over the counter, would coincide down to the exact millisecond. This suggested that the data and information contained in the Status Update are not reliable, thus raising doubts as to whether the Registered Mail was in fact “collected by the customer” as the Status Update appears to suggest.</a></p><a id="p1_55"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a><a id="p1_56">56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unreliability of the Status Update is accentuated by the Plaintiff’s evidence that the Plaintiff’s office attendant, Mr. Ming, left the Plaintiff’s address at 9.52am on 2 February 2021 to go to the Ang Mo Kio Post Office to collect SICC mails. This was backed by several pieces of documentary evidence:</a></p><a id="p1_56"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56"></a><a id="p1_56-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there was documentary evidence in the form of the Comfort Transportation taxi receipt dated 2 February 2021<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a>, read with an extract from the Plaintiff’s transport claims system<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>, which showed that the Plaintiff’s Mr. Ming only departed from the Plaintiff’s address at 9.52am. Mr. Ming therefore could not have collected the AR Registered Mail from the Ang Mo Kio Post Office counter-staff at 9.00am sharp as the Status Update suggested.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Ming also confirmed, during cross-examination, that he usually left the Plaintiff’s address after 9.30am to go to the Ang Mo Kio Post Office<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff’s “CPS Corporate Card Control / Claim Form” also showed that Ang Mo Kio Post Office was the second location on Mr. Ming’s trip on 2 February 2021<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a> – <em>i.e.</em>, Mr. Ming did not make a direct trip to the Ang Mo Kio Post Office. This further suggested that Mr. Ming could not have been at Ang Mo Kio Post Office at 9.00am, again rendering it unlikely that Mr. Ming collected the AR Registered Mail at 9.00 am sharp.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57">57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viewing the Status Update together with all the evidence and surrounding circumstances, I agree with Plaintiff’s Counsel that the Status Update was inadequate to prove that the Non-Renewal Letter was collected by SICC staff on 2 February 2021. In fact, it pointed to the contrary, and raised the question of who the registered mail was actually handed over to at or after 9.00am at Ang Mo Kio Post Office on 2 February 2021.</a></p><a id="p1_57"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff’s conducted as further corroborative evidence that the Plaintiff did not have actual notice of the Non-Renewal Letter</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a><a id="p1_58">58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>1L30G’s</em> case, the High Court took cognizance of the conduct of the plaintiff post the alleged dispatch of the notice of non-renewal to support its finding that the plaintiff did not have actual notice of the notice of non-renewal.

Mr. Wong had in his 19 April 2021 email to Ms. Rajita stated that “<em>I think we are ok for time because the performance bond provides for automatic renewal upon expiry unless the insurance company gives SICC 90 days’ notice of termination.

The fact that Plaintiff did not call on the Performance Guarantee to recover these liquidated damages and rectification costs when the Performance Guarantee had not yet expired, again suggested that the Plaintiff was laboring under the belief that the Performance Guarantee was being automatically renewed, and that no Non-Renewal Letter had yet been served.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">(C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plaintiff’s failure to return the original bond and discharge letter</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62">62&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, although the Non-Renewal Letter expressly requested the Plaintiff to “return the original bond … and discharge letter to discharge [the Defendant’s] liability”,<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a> the Plaintiff did not issue the original Performance Guarantee and/or the “discharge letter” to the Defendant.

The Defendant’s Kelly Ho confirmed that she was aware that as at February 2021, due to the Covid pandemic, postmen could not deliver registered mail directly to the recipients; the registered mails were instead placed in letter boxes and the yellow card chopped and signed by the postman<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a>. Despite having such knowledge, Kelly Ho did not take other proactive steps to ensure that the Non-Renewal Letter, which she conceded was an important document with “significant financial impact”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span>, was brought to the attention of the Plaintiff, such as by delivering personally to SICC. She could, alternatively, have faxed a copy of the Non-Renewal Letter to SICC, or sent a copy by email to SICC (as was done for Gim). The Defendant chose to do none of these. Since the Defendant had chosen to use AR Registered Mail, it assumed the risks of any non-delivery or misdelivery that are associated with the post: see <em>1L30G</em> at [35].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65">65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having regard to all of the foregoing, I find that the Defendant has failed to show that the Plaintiff has received and has actual notice of the Non-Renewal Letter on a balance of probabilities.</a></p><a id="p1_65"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the requirement that the Defendant give 90-days’ written notice prior to the expiry of the Performance Guarantee was fulfilled (the “Condition Precedent Issue”).</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a><a id="p1_66">66&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Condition Precedent Issue concerns the issue of whether by sending a Non-Renewal Letter dated 5 February to the Plaintiff, the Defendant has effectively given the Plaintiff only 89-days’ notice of its intention not to renew the Performance Guarantee upon its expiry on 5 May 2021, as opposed to the contractually required 90-days.</a></p><a id="p1_66"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a><a id="p1_67">67&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant’s case is that the Non-Renewal Letter was in fact dispatched on 29 January 2021, but post-dated to 5 February 2021 to provision for a time buffer arising from the mailing process.

Instead, the Performance Guarantee was automatically renewed in accordance with Clause 3 of the Performance Guarantee.
