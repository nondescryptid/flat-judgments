The issue in dispute is the District Court’s civil jurisdiction where a claim in excess of the District Court limit (“DC limit”) of $250,000 is filed by the plaintiff. If the plaintiff invokes s.22(1) of the State Courts Act 1970 to abandon the excess amount, what is the maximum amount the plaintiff can be awarded if damages are to be reduced on account of the plaintiff’s contributory negligence?</a></p><a id="p1_1"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this issue appeared to have been decided by the Court of Appeal in <em>Keppel Singmarine Dockyard Pte Ltd v Ng Chan Teng</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 2 SLR(R) 0839.xml')">[2008] 2 SLR(R) 839</a>, the Deputy Registrar hearing the assessment of damages<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> agreed with the decision in <em>Au Eong Poh Choo, Serene v Singapore Swimming Club</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/28835-SSP.xml')">[2022] SGDC 226</a> (“Serene Au”) that the legal position in <em>Keppel</em> was no longer applicable as s.19 of the State Courts Act was different from the provision considered by the Court of Appeal. In particular, it lacked the words “whether on balance of account or otherwise” which the Deputy Registrar felt was crucial to the Court of Appeal’s decision.

In <em>Keppel</em>, the plaintiff was injured in an industrial accident and commenced proceedings in the District Court.

Therefore, s.19(4)(a) operates to exclude the District Court’s jurisdiction when the amount claimed exceeds the DC limit and this is on 100% basis and before any reduction for contributory negligence.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Plaintiff’s submission on the first issue</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff urged the Court to adopt a purposive interpretation to s.19(4). As there was no evidence that Parliament intended to legislatively overrule <em>Keppel</em>, s.19(4) should be interpreted in a manner that preserves the legal position in <em>Keppel</em>. In addition, the Plaintiff pointed out that the Deputy Registrar’s decision would lead to higher costs for claimants and encourage cases to be needlessly commenced in the High Court.</a></p><a id="p1_17"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The decision in Serene Au</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Serene Au</em> four main factors were put forward in support of the interpretation of “amount claimed” as referring to amount claimed on a 100% basis:</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_18-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>First Factor:</u> There is a distinction between the Court’s <em>jurisdiction</em> and its <em>powers</em>.

In respect of the third factor of promoting certainty, the lack of further litigation on this issue after <em>Keppel</em> was decided suggests that litigants found the uncertainty caused by the decision to be manageable. As for the fourth factor, I note that my decision on the third issue avoids a situation where the size of the award depends on whether or not liability is resolved separately from quantum.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">First factor: Jurisdiction</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 19 is a provision that confers jurisdiction on a District Court to hear certain types of claims. Section 19(4) states that subject to sections 22 and 23 (as my discussion of Issue 2 will show, this is quite an important caveat but I leave it to one side for now), the District Court does not have the jurisdiction to hear and try any action where the “amount claimed” in the action exceeds the DC limit.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jurisdiction of a court is its authority, however derived, to hear and determine a dispute that was brought before it. If a court had the power to grant a remedy or make a certain order, it could only exercise that power in a subject matter in which it had jurisdiction: <em>Muhd Munir v Noor Hidah and other applications</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1990] 2 SLR(R) 0348.xml')">[1990] 2 SLR(R) 348</a> at [19].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it would be important to know at the time the writ and statement of claim is filed, whether the District Court has the jurisdiction to hear or try the action. At the time of filing, only the amount claimed on a 100% basis can be quantified while the amount claimed after taking into contributory negligence cannot.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Second factor: The 2016 Order </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words “amount claimed” are also found in the operation of paras 2 and 2A of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Transfer of Specified Proceedings to District Court) Order 2016. The Order confers jurisdiction on a District Court to hear certain types of cases where the “amount claimed” exceeds the DC limit.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a> Since the Order also uses the words “amount claimed” in the context of conferring jurisdiction, these words should have a consistent meaning.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Registrar in <em>Serene Au</em> stated at [40]:</a></p><a id="p1_24"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">These paragraphs essentially provide that certain motor accident and industrial accident proceedings commenced in the High Court/General Division of the High Court are transferred for hearing and determination in the District Court “where the <b><em>amount claimed</em></b> in the action does not exceed $500,000” [emphasis added]. As the Defendant submitted, these transfers take place shortly after the claim is filed and before liability is determined. Indeed, I understand that these transfers take place automatically once the claim is filed. Again, at that stage, only the amount claimed on a 100% basis can be quantified; the amount claimed after taking contributory negligence into account cannot.

When a plaintiff files a claim in excess of the DC limit and invokes s.22, the claim can then be heard in the District Court. There are two approaches to understanding how s.22 operates:</a></p><a id="p1_33"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33"></a><a id="p1_33-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Confers Jurisdiction:</u> Under this approach, the District Court does not have the jurisdiction to hear the action as s.19(4) operates to exclude the jurisdiction of the District Court. However, if the plaintiff satisfies all of its requirements including abandoning the excess amount under s.22, the section confers jurisdiction on the District Court to hear the action.</a></p><a id="p1_33-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_33-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Does not confer jurisdiction:</u> Under this approach, the District Court does not have the jurisdiction to hear the action as s.19(4) operates to exclude the jurisdiction of the District Court. Section 22 does not confer jurisdiction but indicates what the plaintiff needs to do in order for the District Court to have jurisdiction under s.19(2) which is to re-quantify the claim.</a></p><a id="p1_33-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that the first approach is correct and that upon satisfying the requirements in s.22, jurisdiction is conferred on the District Court to hear the action:</a></p><a id="p1_34"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34"></a><a id="p1_34-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 19(4), which excludes the jurisdiction of the Court to hear cases above the DC limit, is expressed to be “subject to s.22 and s.23.” Given that s.19(4) operates to exclude the District Court’s jurisdiction in certain cases, this suggests that s.22 and s.23 are also provisions that can modify the District Court’s jurisdiction. If all s.22 is doing is telling plaintiffs to re-quantify their claim to $250,000 or less, there is no need for s.19(4) to be subject to it.</a></p><a id="p1_34-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_34-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 23 confers on the District Court the jurisdiction to hear cases where the amount claimed is above the DC limit upon the signing of the requisite memorandum. Even though s.23 refers to jurisdiction under s.19(2), it is clear that <em>without s.23</em>, it would not be possible for s.19(2) to give the District Court the jurisdiction to hear such a claim. I am of the view that section 22 operates in a similar manner to confer jurisdiction on the District Court if the plaintiff abandons the excess amount.</a></p><a id="p1_34-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_34-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 22(2) begins with the clause “Where a District Court has <em>jurisdiction</em> to hear and try an action by <em>virtue of this section</em>.” The words “by virtue of this section” are consistent with section 22 being a provision that confers jurisdiction.</a></p><a id="p1_34-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If section 22 does not confer jurisdiction, it is unclear what function it has. As the Deputy Registrar in <em>Serene Au</em> noted at [24], if the Plaintiff re-quantifies his claim such that it is now within the DC limit, there would not be any need for the section as the claim is now within the limit and s.22 no longer applies (section 22 only applies in cases where the amount claimed exceeds the DC limit). Conversely, if the abandonment of the excess means that the claim still remains above the DC limit, this would give meaning to sub-paragraphs (c) and (d) which prevent the plaintiff from recovering an amount exceeding this limit.</a></p><a id="p1_35"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the issue caused by different heads of damage attracting different rates of pre-judgment interest, I agreed with the view of the Deputy Registrar in <em>Serene Au</em> that this was not an insurmountable problem. The suggestion that the Court could prorate the apportionment under the various heads of claim appears to be workable.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Third Issue: Is the reduction for contributory made from damages assessed or from the DC limit?</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having determined that s.22 confers jurisdiction on a District Court to hear an action where the “amount claimed” exceeds the DC limit if the plaintiff abandons the excess amount, I now turn to the third issue. If the District Court has the jurisdiction to hear the case and assess damages and is limited by s.22(1)(c) to making an award within the DC limit, what is the maximum amount the Plaintiff may recover if there is a reduction for contributory negligence?</a></p><a id="p1_37"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two possible approaches:</a></p><a id="p1_38"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38"></a><a id="p1_38-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduction for contributory negligence is made from damages actually assessed.</a></p><a id="p1_38-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_38-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduction for contributory negligence is made from the DC Court limit (if the damages assessed exceed the DC limit).</a></p><a id="p1_38-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that given the Deputy Registrar’s decision that the claim had to be re-quantified to within the DC limit, there was no need for her to consider this issue. If the plaintiff’s claim was re-quantified to $250,000 on a 100% basis, this would necessarily mean that any reduction due to contributory negligence would operate on this amount and the final award would always be within the DC limit.</a></p><a id="p1_39"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a><a id="p1_40">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the first approach is correct, subject to the limitation in s.22 that the maximum amount the Plaintiff may recover is the District Court limit of $250,000. When hearing a claim in excess of the DC limit, it stands to reason that the District Court has the power to ascertain what would be recoverable if the DC limit did not apply. This calculation would also have to take into account contributory negligence.</a></p><a id="p1_40"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a><a id="p1_41">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the District Court assesses what would be recoverable and arrives at a final amount, the next question is what orders the Court can make. It is then that reference is made to s.22(1)(c) which indicates that the District Court only has the power to make an award up to the DC limit of $250,000.</a></p><a id="p1_41"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a><a id="p1_42">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach is consistent with the observations of both the Court of Appeal and the High Court in <em>Keppel</em>. I begin with the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>Keppel</em> where the Court considered s.3(3) of the Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act 1953 and noted that:</a></p><a id="p1_42"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]f a defendant’s liability is limited by contract or written law, any reduction for contributory negligence would operate on the total assessed damages and not on the limits imposed by contract or statute.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">That being the case, we do not see why the courts ought to take a diametrically opposite (and illogical) approach by making reductions for contributory negligence from the District Court limit if the defendant’s liability is limited by the court’s jurisdictional limit under the Act. Instead, the requisite reduction should be made from the damages actually assessed regardless of whether the defendant’s liability is limited by the jurisdictional limit of the court, by contract or by statute.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a><a id="p1_43">43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Registrar in <em>Serene Au</em> cited this passage in his judgment and recognised that it could support the proposition that a reduction of damages due to contributory negligence should operate on damages actually assessed. However, he noted that this was not the basis of the Court of Appeal’s decision and that s.3(3) of the 1953 Act was not directly applicable as it dealt with the limitation of liability pursuant to contract or written law (and not jurisdiction).</a></p><a id="p1_43"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a><a id="p1_44">44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal’s analysis in the passage above assumes that the Court already has the <em>jurisdiction</em> to hear the case and discusses the <em>power</em> of the Court to reduce damages due to contributory negligence. However, the Deputy Registrar was seeking to answer a question about the <em>jurisdiction</em> of the District Court and correctly concluded that this discussion of <em>powers</em> did not assist him.</a></p><a id="p1_44"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a><a id="p1_45">45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the third issue deals with how the District Court should exercise its <em>power</em> to reduce damages on account of contributory negligence rather than its <em>jurisdiction</em>. As such, I find that the Court of Appeal’s observation on contributory negligence supports the interpretation that contributory negligence operates on damages actually assessed.</a></p><a id="p1_45"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a><a id="p1_46">46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further support can be found in the High Court judgment in <em>Ng Chan Teng v Keppel Singmarine Dockyard Pte Ltd</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 4 SLR(R) 0633.xml')">[2007] 4 SLR(R) 633</a> which arrived at the same result as the Court of Appeal without reference to the words “or otherwise.” I begin the analysis with an extract from paragraph 3 of Justice Choo Han Teck’s judgment:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">At that point, the amount of damages is not known. It might be less than the District Court statutory limit of $250,000 as stipulated by s&nbsp;20 of the Subordinate Courts Act read with s&nbsp;2 of the same, or it might be more. If it was less, the District Court would not only determine the quantum but also have the authority to order it to be paid. However, if the quantum assessed exceeded $250,000, the District Court would not have the <b>power</b> to order the full amount to be paid. Its order would be limited to the sum of $250,000. When a defendant consents to an interlocutory judgment at 70% liability (as in the present case) with damages to be assessed, he is taken to have accepted responsibility and bound to pay 70% of the damages that he would have to pay had he been found entirely liable (<em>ie</em>, 100%). It is <b>only after damages have been assessed that the court needs to know whether there are any other rules that prevent the plaintiff from fully recovering the amount assessed. It is then that s&nbsp;20 of the Subordinate Courts Act applies, and the court cannot make an order that is more than $250,000 although the amount assessed was more.</b> (emphasis added)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47">47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Justice Choo begins paragraph 3 of his judgment by saying that the sequence of proceedings is important. He discusses the <em>power</em> of the District Court to order a sum not exceeding the DC limit to be paid notwithstanding the fact that the amount assessed exceeded that amount. This paragraph suggests that the power is exercised at the <em>end</em> of the assessment of damages process. Given this sequence, it means that the Court should assess the damages first and reduce the assessed amount if contributory negligence is found or agreed upon. If the amount is still above the DC limit, s.22(1)(c) applies to limit the Court’s power in respect of the amount recoverable.</a></p><a id="p1_47"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a><a id="p1_48">48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can borrow the figures in <em>Keppel</em> to illustrate how this operates in a hypothetical case:</a></p><a id="p1_48"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48"></a><a id="p1_48-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interlocutory judgment is entered with the defendant accepting 70% liability.</a></p><a id="p1_48-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_48-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damages at 100% liability are quantified at $923,000. As the amount claimed exceeds the DC limit, the plaintiff must rely on either s.22 or s.23 of the Act in order for the District Court to have jurisdiction to hear an action where the amount claimed exceeds the DC limit.</a></p><a id="p1_48-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_48-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 70% liability, this amounts to about $646,000.

If section 22 applies, it can only make an award of up to $250,000 due to s.22(1)(c). On the other hand, if section 23 applies, there is no such restriction on the Court’s power to make an award in excess of $250,000</a></p><a id="p1_48-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_49">49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One practical implication of this approach is that plaintiffs may include in the Joint Opening Statement (“JOS”) for Assessment of Damages for Personal Injury Claims an amount claimed that exceeds the DC Limit. Re-quantification of the claim is not required though the Plaintiffs have to accept that the maximum amount recoverable is subject to the DC limit. This appears to be a practice adopted by plaintiffs in the State Courts. For example, this was done in <em>K Jeyakumar Naikar v Huationg Contractor Pte Ltd and another (supra).</em> Similarly, the Plaintiffs in the present case also filed a JOS that exceeded the DC limit though the Deputy Registrar ruled that they needed to re-quantify this amount.</a></p><a id="p1_49"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a><a id="p1_50">50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons stated above, the appeal is allowed.
