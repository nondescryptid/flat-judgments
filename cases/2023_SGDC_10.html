Using these sentencing considerations as a reference, I considered the following factors in determining the appropriate sentences to be imposed:</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_24-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The amount involved.</u> One of the primary aggravating factors in this case was the substantial amount of funds involved in the charges. $912,129.70 is a very significant amount of money. On the proceeded charges alone, the amount involved stands at S$602,461.70.</a></p><a id="p1_24-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_24-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Transnational element.</u> There was clearly a transnational element to the offences, given that the accused persons transferred the funds received to foreign bank accounts.</a></p><a id="p1_24-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_24-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Degree of planning and premeditation, and the level of sophistication of the scheme.</u> I agreed with the Prosecution that the offences were clearly premeditated and involved a level of sophistication. In my view, the Defence’s position that this was a scheme that “<em>practically anyone could have thought of</em>” unfairly downplayed the nature of the scheme. The plan to use the bank accounts of foreign nationals who were leaving Singapore was one designed to mitigate the risk of detection, which Zhang was clearly alive to.</a></p><a id="p1_24-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_24-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Duration of offending.</u> The offences were committed over a period of 49 days. The Defence argued that this was not a long period of time, as the Prosecution had characterised it. 49 days is indeed not a very long period, but it is clear on this fact that the accused persons had not engaged in a one-off or even brief bout of criminal activity. They were persistent and prolific in their criminal conduct in this period, receiving $912,129.70 in the bank accounts that they controlled over this period of 49 days, stopping only after they were arrested at the roadblock.</a></p><a id="p1_24-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_24-p2_e">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The offender’s knowledge of the underlying predicate offence.</u> The Defence sought to emphasise that the accused persons were not aware of that the funds were proceeds of cheating offences but instead proceeds from illegal online gambling. I agreed with the Defence that there is indeed room to distinguish between an offender who has direct knowledge of the underlying criminal conduct and one who only had reasonable grounds to believe that he was facilitating a third party’s benefits of criminal conduct. That said, even by the accused persons own account, they were never under any illusion (however flimsy) that they were dealing were untainted funds, since they were under the impression that these were the proceeds from illegal online gambling.</a></p><a id="p1_24-p2_e"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_e"></a><a id="p1_24-p2_f">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The prospect of reward.</u> Both accused persons had engaged in this criminal enterprise in anticipation of the financial benefits that they would obtain in the form of commissions, which would have amounted to a significant amount based on the agreed rate of $200 per $10,000 received in the bank accounts.</a></p><a id="p1_24-p2_f"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24-p2_f"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the offender-specific factors, I had regard to the fact that the accused persons had elected to plead guilty to the charges, which I accepted should be accorded mitigating weight.</a></p><a id="p1_25"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the hearing, Defence Counsel informed me that the accused persons did not intend to lay claim to the sum of $406,850 that had been seized from them, which formed the subject matter of the TIC charges under section 35 of the Miscellaneous Offences Act. Defence Counsel argued that this amount of money ought to be considered as partial recovery of the funds involved in the case that could be returned to victims.</a></p><a id="p1_26"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not think that much credit could be given for the $406,850 that the accused persons were intending not to lay claim to. This amount was seized from the accused persons when they were caught at a police roadblock, as opposed to having been voluntarily surrendered or paid in restitution. In fact, as the charges against the accused persons make plain, the accused persons were not able to give a satisfactory explanation of why this amount of cash was found in their possession. As the Prosecution pointed out, the sum of $912,129.70 that formed the subject matter of the CDSA charges had been transferred into the foreign bank accounts by the accused persons and did not overlap with the $406,850 in cash that was seized from the accused persons.</a></p><a id="p1_27"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentences imposed</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining the sentences to be imposed on the accused persons, I considered the precedents that parties had referred to in submissions.</a></p><a id="p1_28"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both parties referred to the case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Bahurudeen Kuthpudeen</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22267-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGDC 260</a> as a useful reference point for the third proceeded charges against the accused persons, <em>i.e.</em> the charges involving the amount of $437,558. In that case, an individual sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment was imposed for a charge under section 47(1)(b) of the CDSA involving a sum of $469,900.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charge in <em>Bahurudeen</em> involved the removal of the offender’s proceeds of his own offence under section 408 of the Penal Code, which meant that the offender did have direct knowledge of the underlying predicate offence. I accept that this can be distinguished from a situation where the offenders do not have direct knowledge of the underlying predicate offence. However, I note that while the accused persons in this case did not have direct knowledge of the underlying predicate offence, this was not a case where they had been given some flimsy cover story with red flags that they ignored – they were never under any illusion that these were untainted funds. As Defence Counsel emphasised several times during the hearing, the accused persons had acted under the impression that they were dealing in the proceeds of illegal online gambling.</a></p><a id="p1_30"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also noted that the offender in <em>Bahurudeen</em> engaged in a single act of removing his proceeds of crime from Singapore by carrying a sum of cash with him as he left Singapore via the Woodlands Checkpoint. In comparison, the third proceeded charges against the accused persons were amalgamated charges that covered conduct over a period of 10 days. The means by which the funds were transferred were also more complex than that in <em>Bahurudeen</em>. There was also the fact that the accused persons in this case faced additional TIC charges for similar offences.</a></p><a id="p1_31"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a balance of these factors, in my view, the conduct of the accused persons on this charge was more aggravated than that of the offender in <em>Bahurudeen</em> and so while the amounts involved in the third proceeded charges and <em>Bahurudeen</em> were similar, I was of the view that a higher sentence of 28 months’ imprisonment against each accused person was appropriate on the third proceeded charges.</a></p><a id="p1_32"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the first and second proceeded charges involving the sums of $61,000 and $103,903.70, I sentenced the accused persons to 5 months’ imprisonment and 9 months’ imprisonment respectively. In doing so, I had regard to the precedents cited by the Prosecution, <em>Public Prosecutor v Ng Koon Lay</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24910-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGDC 196</a> and <em>Public Prosecutor v Zulkiffili Bin Radi</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18963-SSP.xml')">[2016] SGDC 145</a>, where the offenders faced charges under section 47(2)(b) of the CDSA involving similar amounts as the first and second proceeded charges. I also noted that the sentences that I had determined were not out of step with the indicative sentencing ranges derived by the District Court in <em>Lee Jun Xiao</em>, which had been cited by the Defence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence also sought to rely on the case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Nordiah Bte Bakar</em>, an unreported decision that was referred to in <em>Public Prosecutor v Ambrose Dionysius</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21424-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGDC 35</a>. Given that no grounds of decision were available, the precedential value of this case was therefore limited, and I did not have significant regard for it.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Consecutive sentences</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ordered the sentences on the first and third proceeded charges to run consecutively.

The accused provided her UOB bank account details to Greg. Thereafter, a sum of $71,000 was received in the UOB account. The accused transferred $62,000 to another bank account as instructed and kept $9,000 for herself. On 23 September 2016, the accused was warned by CAD not to receive any more monies in her bank account as her bank account was being used to receive illegal funds. Despite this warning, on 29 September 2016, the accused received another US$88,000 (S$118,360) from Greg in her Citibank account (subject to the s. 411 PC charge). She later transferred S$89,860 (subject to s. 47(2)(b) CDSA charge) and S$22,000 to other bank accounts, keeping S$6,500 for herself. The US$88,000 were proceeds of a cheating offence and the accused had reason to believe the US$88,000 was stolen property.
