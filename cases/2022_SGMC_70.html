Attracted by the offer of fast cash, the Accused contacted “Bay” in early August 2021. “Bay” told the Accused that he would be given “around $400” if he were to open a bank account with United Overseas Bank (“UOB”) or Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (“OCBC”) and hand over the Automated Teller Machine (the “ATM”) card and Personal Identification Number (“PIN”) (the “scheme”).</a></p><a id="p1_7"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused agreed to participate in the scheme.

This was an act which UOB would not have done if it had not been so deceived, and which was likely to cause harm to UOB’s reputation.

The UOB account was subsequently frozen pursuant to police investigations.

The overall facts and circumstances of the case did not displace the Court’s focus on rehabilitation as its objective in sentencing<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a>. With that in mind, I called for a pre-sentence Probation suitability report. Subsequently, I also called for a Reformative Training suitability report.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Accused Found Unsuitable for Probation</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was unsurprising that the Accused was not found suitable for probation.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As highlighted by the Probation Officer Mr Gilbert Goh, the Accused’s repeated offending behaviour despite being placed on the Guidance Programme and a Probation Order reflected his lack of remorse and internalisation of the consequences of his actions<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a>. In 2018, the Accused was placed on the Guidance Programme for theft in dwelling offences but failed to successfully complete the programme due to the commission of offences for which he was subsequently charged in court and placed on probation for in October 2019. He again failed to complete his period of probation when he committed this set of offences before me. As observed by the Probation Officer, the conduct of the Accused demonstrated a poor response to intervention by authorities. His level of risk-taking, pro-criminal attitudes and disregard for the law indicated his lack of consequential thinking<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The home environment did not appear conducive for the Accused’s rehabilitation. Whilst the Accused acknowledged his parents’ concern for him, he chose only to engage in superficial conversations with them and/or retort by shouting at them or walking away<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a>. As assessed by the Probation Officer, the Accused’s parents had been limited in their ability to influence him positively despite their best efforts<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even an environment like the military where the Accused was serving his National Service did not seem to influence him positively. As noted by the Probation Officer, since 1 Jan 2022, the Accused had been on medical leave for more than 120 days such that his unit was unable to provide an assessment of his performance. The Accused’s tendency to obtain medical certificates through convenient means (virtual platforms) just because he “<em>did not like the military regime and found the duties in camp to be boring</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a> to avoid returning to camp suggested a lack of motivation to be constructively engaged and disregard for authority<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>. Despite the advice of the Probation Officer, the Accused persisted in obtaining medical certificates to avoid reporting to camp for duties<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having perused the Probation report, I did not see any basis to disagree with the findings of the Probation Officer. The viability of putting the Accused on probation had been thoroughly considered by the Probation Officer. The Accused did not challenge or query the contents of the Probation Report when given the opportunity to do so. Other than making an application to serve his term of Reformative Training at a later date, the Accused had nothing to say in mitigation<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Reformative Training as the Appropriate Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the Accused was found physically and mentally suitable for a term of reformative training. The Reformative Training report recognized that the Accused had multiple needs that required intervention, namely in the areas of his attitudes supportive of crime, his poor relationship with his family, poor academic performance, limited engagement in National Service, alcohol use, unconstructive use of leisure time and poor coping with stress<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a>. A Level Two intensity of rehabilitation in the Reformative Training Centre (RTC) was recommended.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As re-emphasized in <em>Public Prosecutor v Ong Jack Hong</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19524-SSP.xml')">[2016] 5 SLR 166</a>, at [11], “<em>the imposition of reformative training remains within the range of sentencing options for young offenders where the focus is on rehabilitation …….. reformative training too is geared towards the rehabilitation of the offender and hence remains a viable option</em>”. At [14], the Court went on to state: “<em>the choice between reformative training and probation is governed primarily by whether there is in the circumstances a need for a degree of deterrence within an overarching focus and emphasis on rehabilitation</em>”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, I was satisfied that a term of reformative training would be the appropriate sentence for the Accused.
