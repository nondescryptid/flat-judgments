The issue of whether an offender who re-offended during probation can be given another round of probation was dealt with in the case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Koh Wen Jie Boaz</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18361-SSP.xml')">[2016] 1 SLR 334</a>. The High Court had held that while the fact that a youthful offender was already under probation when he committed the offence in question was not a bar to a second sentence of probation, it was incumbent on the offender to satisfy the court that probation remained a viable option and there was no reason in all the circumstances to opt for a sentence that had a greater emphasis on deterrence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The High Court went on to set out the following factors that a court should take into account when deciding whether a second sentence of probation should be imposed:</a></p><a id="p1_36"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_36-p2_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether the latest offence in question is serious;</a></p><a id="p1_36-p2_i"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_i"></a><a id="p1_36-p2_ii">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether the offender’s pattern of offending displaces the focus on rehabilitation or at least mandated greater emphasis on deterrence;</a></p><a id="p1_36-p2_ii"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_ii"></a><a id="p1_36-p2_iii">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether there is evidence of genuine remorse;</a></p><a id="p1_36-p2_iii"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_iii"></a><a id="p1_36-p2_iv">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether there is cause for assurance that the risk factors which caused the last attempt at probation to fail had been addressed; and</a></p><a id="p1_36-p2_iv"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_iv"></a><a id="p1_36-p2_v">(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether there are any countervailing considerations such as the public interest in prevention or deterrence that militate against a second order of probation.</a></p><a id="p1_36-p2_v"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36-p2_v"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying these factors to the present case, I found that it would not be appropriate to grant the Accused a second round of probation. I highlight the more relevant factors as follows.</a></p><a id="p1_37"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The latest offences were serious</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fresh offences, the Accused had admitted in his Statement of Facts<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a> that in July 2021, that after coming across a message, sent on an unspecified Telegram group by one “Bay”, offering fast cash for the opening of bank account, he had contacted “Bay” in early August 2021. “Bay” told the Accused that he would be given “around $400” if he were to open a bank account with United Overseas Bank (“UOB”) or Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (“OCBC”) and hand over the Automated Teller Machine (the “ATM”) card and Personal Identification Number (“PIN”) (the “scheme”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused agreed to participate in the scheme. He informed “Bay” that he would open two bank accounts, one with UOB and another with OCBC, in exchange for $800. Pursuant to the scheme, the Accused had applied for 2 bank accounts, one with UOB and another with OCBC on 13 August 2021.</a></p><a id="p1_39"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a><a id="p1_40">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In both applications, the Accused had declared that he would be the ultimate beneficial owner of the bank account that he was applying for, a fact which he knew at the time to be false.</a></p><a id="p1_40"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a><a id="p1_41">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Accused’s deception, UOB and OCBC had approved the applications, an act which they would not have done if they had not been so deceived, and which was likely to cause harm to their reputation. The Accused subsequently handed the ATM card and PIN linked to both bank accounts to “Bay”.</a></p><a id="p1_41"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a><a id="p1_42">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police investigations later revealed that the UOB account had been the subject of at least 27 police reports involving a reported total loss of at least $129,591.70. The UOB account’s bank statements also showed that it had been used to receive a total of $214,353.38 in 85 separate transactions from 31 August to 2 September 2021. By the time the UOB account was frozen pursuant to police investigations, the vast majority of the monies had been dissipated and only a balance of $0.67 remained.</a></p><a id="p1_42"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a><a id="p1_43">43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police investigations revealed that the OCBC account had been the subject of at least 12 police reports involving a reported total loss of at least $21,106.20. The OCBC account’s bank statements also showed that it had been used to receive a total of $29,664.68 in 38 separate transactions from 22 to 23 August 2021. By the time the OCBC account was frozen pursuant to police investigations, the vast majority of the monies had been dissipated and only a balance of $1.00 remained.</a></p><a id="p1_43"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a><a id="p1_44">44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the fresh offences committed by the Accused were serious in that actual and substantial harm was caused. Through his act of opening up the bank accounts and thereafter handing over the control of these accounts, he had facilitated the dissipation of monies belonging to many victims.</a></p><a id="p1_44"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Pattern of offending and his response towards rehabilitation efforts</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a><a id="p1_45">45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of pattern of offending, it can be said that the Accused’s offending had escalated from relatively minor offences of theft to cheating of banks resulting in substantial harm.</a></p><a id="p1_45"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a><a id="p1_46">46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused’s escalation in offending came about despite having already undergone almost the full probation period of 2 years. He had reoffended just 2 months before completion of his probation. This shows that the Accused had failed to internalise the values taught to him over a period of 22 months. As highlighted in the Progress Report by his Probation Officer at para 9.1 and 9.2:</a></p><a id="p1_46"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Ren’s offences stemmed from greed. Despite intervention prior to being placed on probation and during probation, his involvement in further offences indicated that he continued to harbour pro-criminal attitudes. He disregarded the consequences of breaking the law to achieve his wants.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Ren had carried over little positives from his rehabilitation into post probation. He showed limited motivation for constructive pursuits as reflected by his prolonged absence from National Service.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether there was any evidence of genuine remorse </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a><a id="p1_47">47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused did not display any concrete evidence of genuine remorse after the commission of the offences other than his plea of guilt. He still showed a reckless disregard for authority and was not averse to taking the easy way out as evidenced by his long period of leave from national service. It was reported in the Progress Report<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a> that since 1 Jan 2022, the Accused was on medical leave for more than 120 days. The Accused admitted that he did not like the military regime and found the duties in camp to be boring. Therefore, he obtained Medical Certificates (MCs) to avoid returning to camp. He consulted doctors from virtual platforms and obtained between 2 to 5 days of MCs each time citing illness such as flu, cough and headaches. He then spent his time at home sleeping or scrolling through social media using his mobile phone. He persisted with this behaviour despite advice from his Probation Officer.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether there is cause for assurance that the risk factors which caused the last attempt at probation to fail had been addressed</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48">48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly, there appears to be no change in his indulgent attitude and no increase in any protective factors. His parents would be obviously disappointed that the Accused was not able to change his ways but unfortunately they themselves were at a loss as to how to improve the situation. His parents were not confident that the Accused would heed their advice. As opined in the Progress Report, despite their best efforts, they had been unable to influence the Accused positively<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">CONCLUSION</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49">49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that given his lack of motivation to change, it would be a futile exercise to place the Accused on another round of probation. However, given his young age, rehabilitation would still be a relevant and important sentencing consideration. The fresh offences committed by the Accused warranted a more deterrent sentence but they were not so serious as to displace rehabilitation as a dominant sentencing principle.</a></p><a id="p1_49"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a><a id="p1_50">50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused was found physically and mentally suitable for a term of reformative training.
