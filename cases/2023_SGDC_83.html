Depending on the dose, the consumption of kratom leaves (typically by chewing the fresh leaves, ingesting the dried leaves in powdered form or drinking kratom tea made from boiling kratom leaves in water) produces opioid and/or stimulant effects. In low doses (&lt;5g), kratom leaves produce “cocaine-like” stimulant effects, <em>e.g.</em>, increased alertness, physical energy and talkativeness, while high doses (5-15g) bring about more “morphine-like” sedative-narcotic effects.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a> As such, kratom leaves have been used both as a stimulant to counter fatigue and enhance stamina as well as an opium substitute, being often marketed as a legal alternative to controlled opiates such as morphine and heroin.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> They have also been used as part of traditional medicine to treat a variety of ailments, especially pain.

The occurrence of mitragynine in Singapore has risen over the years. Mitragynine was the sixth-most common NPS identified in drugs samples analysed in Singapore in 2018 and 2019, and became the <em>most</em> common NPS detected in Singapore in 2020.</a></p><a id="p1_29"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution urged this Court to impose a deterrent sentence to stem the tide of the growing abuse of mitragynine, and the potential deleterious effects it brings. Considering the substantial quantity of mitragynine involved and the fact that the accused’s attempted possession of the drugs was for a purpose connected to its illicit circulation in Singapore, the Prosecution submitted that a sentence of five to six years’ imprisonment is necessary to meet the need for deterrence.</a></p><a id="p1_30"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigation</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Counsel for the accused stated that in or around November 2021, accused came to be acquainted with an individual known to him as “Wan”.

This is because offenders in the former group harm <em>other persons</em>, as opposed to consumers who primarily harm themselves. As the offender in <em>Ramesh</em> must have known that he was committing some act that was connected to the illicit circulation of the drugs by safekeeping the drugs for one Chander with the intention of returning the same to the latter, the Court of Appeal held that it would be appropriate to impose a penalty at the higher end of the sentencing range.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to the quantity of drugs involved, the Court of Appeal in <em>Ramesh</em> had regard to the fact the quantity of diamorphine involved was 29.96g, which is almost double that which would attract capital punishment in the context of a trafficking charge and found that a sentence of ten years’ imprisonment was appropriate.</a></p><a id="p1_36"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Prosecution’s submission that notwithstanding <em>Ramesh</em> was a case involving the possession of diamorphine, the two considerations identified by the Court of Appeal are equally relevant to the present case. Applying these principles to the present case, the accused intended to keep 1 kg of kratom for himself and to deliver at least 4,843g of kratom to others either in the form of leaves or tea made by him. His attempted possession of the drugs was therefore largely for the purpose of facilitating its circulation, which is more serious than mere possession of the same for consumption. Had the accused been charged for attempted possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking, he would be facing an imprisonment term of at least 5 years and 5 strokes of the cane.</a></p><a id="p1_37"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dominant sentencing principle in the sentencing of drug offences is deterrence.
