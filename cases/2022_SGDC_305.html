One charge involved robbery with hurt, and the other two involved housebreaking by night, in order to commit theft. All these three charges carried, as indicative punishment, mandatory minimum imprisonment sentences as well as mandatory caning. The Accused was represented by Defence Counsel (the “DC”) when he pleaded guilty, and when the Mitigation was presented.</a></p><a id="p1_1"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Accused pleaded guilty, he understood the nature and consequences of his plea of guilt. This was confirmed by the DC. The Accused also admitted to the contents of the Statement of Facts (the “SOF”) without qualification. In addition to the three charges to which the Accused pleaded guilty to, the Accused admitted to 20 other charges and consented to these being taken into consideration (“TIC”) for purposes of sentencing. The Accused had a long history of prior offending. The TIC charges and the criminal record of the Accused will be referred to, later.</a></p><a id="p1_2"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution submitted that the Accused should be sentenced to a period of Corrective Training (“CT”) of at least 10 years, and 16 strokes of the cane. Following the framework set out in <em>Sim Yeow Kee v PP and another appeal</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19663-SSP.xml')">[2016] 5 SLR 936</a> (“<em>Sim Yeow Kee</em>”), the Prosecution submitted that had the Accused been sentenced to a sentence of “regular imprisonment” (the term as used in <em>Sim Yeow Kee</em>), the total imprisonment sentence “would likely” have been “at least 12 years’ imprisonment in total” (the “Indicative Regular Imprisonment Sentence”). The Prosecution submitted that a sentence of at least 10 years’ CT (and 16 strokes of the cane) would be appropriate in this case. The Defence did not dispute that the “technical requirements” for CT to be imposed had been satisfied. The Defence sought a shorter period of CT (and disputed that the Indicative Regular Imprisonment Sentence would add up to 12 years’ imprisonment).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused was represented by DC Ms Jeanny Ng at the time he pleaded guilty and when the Mitigation was presented. DC Ms Ng was discharged from further acting for the Accused, on 17 August 2021. Thereafter, the Accused acted in person, till 24 November 2021, when DC Mr Luke Lee was appointed to act for the Accused. DC Mr Lee was discharged from further acting for the Accused on 26 January 2022. Thereafter, the Accused acted in person (including for the filing of the appeal herein). I shall refer to DC Ms Ng as the “1<sup>st</sup> DC” and Mr Lee as the “2<sup>nd</sup> DC” where it is necessary to differentiate between the two DC. At this stage, it must be stated that both the 1<sup>st</sup> DC and the 2<sup>nd</sup> DC had acted with the highest regard to their respective obligations as officers of the Court and in the upholding of the best traditions and values of the Bar when they represented the Accused.</a></p><a id="p1_4"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused had sought to retract his guilty plea subsequent to his being convicted (but prior to sentencing). Suffice to say, neither the 1<sup>st</sup> DC nor the 2<sup>nd</sup> DC would act for the Accused in making such an application. Ultimately, I heard submissions from the Prosecution and the Accused in person, as to whether the Accused should be allowed to retract his guilty plea. I found that there was no basis for rejecting the guilty plea, which had been taken when the Accused was very ably represented by the 1<sup>st</sup> DC. Allowing the retraction of the guilty plea would have amounted to an abuse of the process of the Court. Whilst the Notice of Appeal indicates that this appeal is only against Sentence, I shall briefly state the reasons why the application of the Accused to retract his guilty plea was rejected, later in these Grounds.</a></p><a id="p1_5"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After considering the submissions on sentence from the Prosecution, and the Defence (contained in the Mitigation Plea prepared by the 1<sup>st</sup> DC) and from the Accused in person, I was satisfied that it was “expedient with a view to (the Accused’s) reformation and the prevention of crime that (the Accused) should receive training of a corrective character for a substantial period of time”, and that there were no “special reasons for not doing so”. The Accused was therefore sentenced to CT for a period of 10 years, backdated to 29 June 2018, the date of remand. The robbery with hurt charge also carried a mandatory caning sentence of at least 12 strokes of the cane. For the two housebreaking by night charges, the Accused was to be punished with caning as well. For the robbery with hurt charge, the Accused was sentenced to 12 strokes of the cane. For each of the two housebreaking by night charges, the Accused was sentenced to two strokes of the cane for each of these two charges.</a></p><a id="p1_6"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total sentence meted out to the Accused was CT for a period of 10 years, with effect from 29 June 2018, and 16 strokes of the cane. The Accused (acting in person) appealed against the Sentence, and is currently serving sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the three proceeded charges, the Accused had committed the offence of robbery with hurt on 8 April 2018. The two housebreaking by night charges were committed on 7 March 2018 and 26 June 2018 respectively. For the two housebreaking by night charges, the Accused had a similar antecedent and had been sentenced (on 15 June 2007) to imprisonment for two years and six months, and was therefore now to be punished with caning in addition to imprisonment that may be meted out for the offence.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SOF sets out, in great detail, the circumstances surrounding each of these three proceeded charges. The Accused had admitted to the facts contained in the SOF when he pleaded guilty, without any qualification.</a></p><a id="p1_9"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the robbery with hurt charge, the SOF describes that the main players in this offence were the Accused, and two other persons whom I shall refer to, for ease of reference, as “SM” and “GJ”. The robbery had taken place in a hotel room and involved the forceful taking of the sum of S$365,000 from one of three victims. Hurt was caused to the three victims. SM had caused hurt by punching two of the victims (including the one from whom the money was stolen). The Accused had caused hurt by punching the remaining victim.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SM and GJ were similarly charged for their respective roles in this robbery. SM was convicted on his plea of guilt and had been sentenced to imprisonment for a term of three years and four months (and caning). GJ had also pleaded guilty (separately) and was sentenced to imprisonment for three years (and caning). What has to be noted is that both SM and GJ had been charged with the lesser charge under s 392 of the Penal Code (robbery) which carried a mandatory minimum imprisonment sentence of three years. The Accused here faced the more serious charge of robbery with hurt under s 394 of the Penal Code which carried a mandatory minimum imprisonment sentence of five years.</a></p><a id="p1_11"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated above, the Accused had attempted to retract his plea of guilt, by claiming that he was on medication at the time he entered his guilty plea, and had been pressured by the 1<sup>st</sup> DC to plead guilty. These allegations were refuted by the Prosecution, which put up a very detailed and persuasive rebuttal to the assertions of the Accused. The Prosecution cited the Court of Appeal decision in <em>PP v Dinesh s/o Rajantheran</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23215-SSP.xml')">[2019] 1 SLR 1289</a> (“<em>Dinesh</em>”). At [54] of <em>Dinesh</em>, the Court of Appeal stated that, “… the onus will be on the accused person to adduce sufficient evidence to convince the court that his plea of guilt was invalid. This is simply a consequence of the fundamental rule of evidence that he who asserts a fact bears the burden of proving it.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assertion by the Accused that the medication he took on the date he entered his plea of guilt had somehow affected his state of mind was shown to be without any basis. A letter dated 20 August 2021 from the Prison medical authorities showed that the medication the Accused had consumed on the material date did not cause “unawareness”. A report dated 11 February 2022 from the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) was produced pursuant to a further remand ordered to ascertain the state of mind of the Accused. The said IMH report opined that the Accused “was not of unsound mind at the time of the alleged offences” and was fit to plead. The IMH report further opined (in agreement with another IMH doctor from an earlier examination) that “should (the Accused) fail to cooperate with court proceedings, this would be intentional and deliberate on (the Accused’s) part”. The IMH doctor concluded his opinion by stating that “(The Accused’s) risk of offending in future is high.”</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dismissing the application of the Accused to reject his guilty plea, I made the following brief oral remarks, <em>ex tempore</em>.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Start of oral remarks) “I will just be giving a few brief oral remarks before delivering my decision on the main point and that is whether Mr. Mohd Abdul Rahman would be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea. On this point, the main case authority is the Court of Appeal decision in PP v Dinesh s/o Rajantheran. And in short, it does set out three categories or cases in which an accused person seeks to withdraw a guilty plea. We can skip over the first category because that’s not applicable, that will be in cases where the accused attempts to withdraw guilty plea after being sentenced. That’s not the case here. Neither is this case under the third category, qualification of plea during mitigation. I agree with the Prosecution that the mitigation plea was a very detailed one put forward by Counsel, Ms. Ng at that point in time. And thus, indicate that the accused was guilty of the charges to which he had pleaded guilty to. So, we come to consider the second category, which is “pre-sentence retraction of plea by challenging the validity of the plead guilty procedure.” I would say that I accept and agree with the Prosecution’s submissions contained in the skeletal submissions. This was a situation where, with legal advice, the accused, Mr. Mohd Abdul Rahman had pleaded guilty, knowing the full consequences of his plea, having been properly advised of the consequences and that having been confirmed by Counsel as well. Statement of Facts have been admitted without qualification. Of great importance in this, in the consideration of this matter is the preparation of the mitigation plea, to which again, I agree with the Prosecution’s formulation of that---that could only have been based on instructions received from the accused. Clearly, Counsel could not be making up matters and would clearly be remiss of her professional obligations had she done so. So, quite clearly, she would have drafted the mitigation plea on behalf of the accused and based on his instructions. In this regard, I’ve---I have seen the letter from the previous Counsel, Ms. Ng, dated September 2021, addressed to the accused and, again, in conjunction with the Prosecution’s submissions, I find then that at the time the plea was taken, the accused have been properly advised and was aware of the consequences of his guilty plea. One of the points he had raised was that he was not aware of proceedings when he had pleaded guilty. Prosecution have shown---have submitted and shown this to be a submission bereft of honesty and candidness. The notes from Dr Cheok dated 20th August 2021 shows very clearly that medications that have been taken by the accused on 7th April 2021 would not have caused unawareness. The evidence is quite clear that the accused knew that he was pleading guilty was properly and firmly advised by his Counsel as to the consequences of the plea. And more importantly, as I’ve said, mitigation had been prepared on that basis. And along the way, during one of the mentions, both Prosecution and Counsel confirmed that there was no qualification of the plea contained in the mitigation, and perusal of mitigation confirms this. So, we come to consider the basis of which the accused seeks to withdraw his guilty plea. In this regard, I would agree with the Prosecution’s submission that what the accused is attempting to do would amount to an abuse of process, having been properly advised, and having been totally aware of the consequences of his plea, he then, for whatever reasons, decides later on to resile from his guilty plea, citing reasons which are shown not to have the ring of truth. As I’ve said, the letter from the former Counsel, Ms. Ng, confirms that he has been properly advised---fully advised in detail, not just to the charges but as to the Statement of Facts and as well as the mitigation and the Prosecution’s submission on sentence. The accused also had the benefit of representation by another Counsel further down the process, Mr. Lee---but Mr. Lee was discharged, no doubt, and we won’t go into detail with this. He was in a position to have advised the accused of the legal position with this matter. In conclusion, as I’ve said, I agree with the Prosecution’s formulation of how the Court should view this attempt by Mr. Mohd Abdul Rahman to withdraw his guilty plea, it would amount to an abuse of process if he were allowed to do so. Therefore, he is not allowed to withdraw his guilty plea. And as the process has properly reached the stage of there having been mitigation properly done by Counsel and Prosecution’s submission on sentence, it just leaves sentencing to be done, which I’m of the view should be done today, but I invite Mr. Mohd Abdul Rahman to make any further submissions he wishes to make. But sentence will be meted out today. Just one---just one further point, the latest IMH report, 11th February 2022, confirms and indicates from the psychiatrist’s point of view that Mr. Abdul---Mr. Mohd Abdul Rahman was not of unsound mind at the time of the alleged offences, was currently fit to plead. And very importantly, Dr Koh in the report agrees with Dr Yeo from an earlier report, that should the accused fail to cooperate with Court proceedings, this would be intentional and deliberate on his part. So, before we proceed further to sentencing---and I’ll also invite Prosecution should they wish to make any further submissions in addition to the previous submissions on sentence, I’ll hear first from Mr. Mohd Abdul Rahman.” (end of oral remarks).</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of sentencing was thus to be considered. I had considered the Prosecution’s sentencing submissions as well as the Defence’s position on sentencing (as set out in the Mitigation plea). I heard further from the Accused and the Prosecution, before sentencing the Accused to CT for a period of 10 years, backdated to 29 June 2018, and 16 strokes of the cane.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had carefully considered the Mitigation – from the Mitigation Plea prepared by the 1<sup>st</sup> DC, as well as what was put forth by the Accused. Ultimately there was nothing substantive to reduce the indicative sentence in any appreciable way. Both the Prosecution and the Defence had agreed that CT was the appropriate sentence to be meted out. Where they differed was as to the length of the CT to be imposed. Before I sentenced the Accused, I made the following very brief oral remarks, <em>ex tempore</em>.</a></p><a id="p1_17"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Start of oral remarks) “Referring to the Prosecution’s skeletal sentencing submission. I’m of the view that the Prosecution’s submissions on this have set out a fair and reasonable indicative sentence. The indicative sentence should Mr Mohd Abdul Rahman Bin Mohamad have been sentenced to imprisonment is fair and perhaps can be said to be on the lenient side considering the aggravated nature of the offences for which he’s to be sentenced as well as his antecedents and the TIC charges that have to be considered as well. And again, the final submission as to the quantum of incarceration is a fair and reasonable one in the circumstances, taking everything into account both the indicative imprisonment sentences if imprisonment was imposed as well as the antecedents and the TIC charges, and the individual circumstances surrounding the charges to be sentenced for. Having been found suitable for corrective training, Mr Mohd Abdul Rahman will hereby be sentenced to corrective training for a term of 10 years, and this will be backdated to the date that you’ve been in remand from 29th June 2018. You are further sentenced to caning for the following charges; for DAC 913723 of 2018, 12 strokes of the cane. DAC 915045 of 2018, 2 strokes of the cane and DAC 921645 of 2018, 2 strokes of the cane. Total sentence, corrective training for a period of 10 years commencing 29th June 2018, and total 16 strokes of the cane.” (end of oral remarks).</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In deciding the sentence to be meted out, it is vital that due and careful consideration is paid to the charges to be TIC. In many cases, the TIC charges, due to their being few in number, or of a less serious nature (compared to the charges being proceeded with), may not directly influence the quantum of punishment to be meted out, to an appreciable extent.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Accused, there was a need to enhance the sentence that was to be meted out for the proceeded charges. The TIC charges showed the Accused to be a person with scant regard for the law, with little or no respect for the numerous victims (for their dignity, their person or their property) who suffered as a result of his lawlessness.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The TIC charges involved property offences, offences against the person, public order offences and road traffic offences. There were five cheating charges, two theft charges, one dishonest misappropriation charge, one housebreaking charge, two trespassing charges, two charges of voluntarily causing hurt, one charge of affray, three charges of intentional harassment, one charge of disorderly behaviour, one charge of driving without a requisite driving licence and one charge of driving without the requisite insurance coverage. Taken together, these charges demonstrate a varied array of law-breaking committed by the Accused. Quite clearly, (when considered together with the three proceeded charges which were by nature, the most serious offences in the crime spree of the Accused), there was an urgent need for a sentence of sufficient length and severity to reform the Accused and to prevent him from further committing offences.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Criminal Records of the Accused also show an alarming history of prior offending. The Accused had been sentenced to reformative training at a Reformative Training Centre in 1998. Since then, (according to the Criminal Records) he had been incarcerated on five separate occasions, and on two other occasions, apparently served default sentences due to the non-payment of fines imposed. The major offences in his criminal past centred around property offences and offences against the person.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Criminal Records, the last conviction on 17 August 2015 resulted in sentences of 15 months’ imprisonment for house-trespass, three months’ imprisonment for causing grievous hurt on provocation and four weeks’ imprisonment for criminal force to deter a public servant being meted out to the Accused. On 19 September 2012, the Accused was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment for theft and 4 weeks’ imprisonment for voluntarily causing hurt. On 15 June 2007 the Accused was convicted of three charges of housebreaking by night, for which he was sentenced to imprisonment terms of two years and six months, two years and two years respectively. These housebreaking antecedents triggered the need to sentence the Accused presently, to caning for the two proceeded housebreaking by night charges.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution, in first setting out what the Accused ought to be sentenced to if “regular imprisonment” was contemplated as appropriate punishment, had indicated eight years’ imprisonment (plus the mandatory minimum 12 strokes of the cane) for the robbery with hurt charge, four and a half years’ imprisonment and two strokes of the cane for the earlier housebreaking by night charge (which involved a larger amount in the value of stolen items as compared to the later housebreaking by night charge), and four years’ imprisonment and two strokes of the cane for the later housebreaking by night charge. The Prosecution thus indicated that (apparently suggesting that the imprisonment terms of eight years and four years run consecutively) a sentence of “at least” 12 years’ imprisonment would qualify as the Indicative Regular Imprisonment Sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was persuaded more by the Prosecution’s submission on sentence than by the position laid out by the Defence in the Mitigation Plea. I do note that of the precedents cited by the Prosecution, some of them are unreported cases. However, for the reasons cited by the Prosecution, especially the focus on the TIC charges and the criminal history of the Accused, I found that the Prosecution’s position on sentence to be well-supported. I agreed with how the Prosecution arrived at the Indicative Regular Imprisonment Sentence, as well as the period of CT the Accused ought to be sentenced to. For the robbery with hurt charge, it was not useful to have full regard to the sentences meted out to SM and GJ, as these two persons had faced less serious charges. The punishment for the charge the Accused faced started from a mandatory minimum of five years’ imprisonment. I did not regard an uplift of three years to be excessive in the circumstances, given the TIC charges to be considered and the antecedents involving property offences. For the housebreaking by night charges, the respective uplifts as compared to the antecedent sentence of two years and six months were similarly not excessive, in my view. I was very careful not to “double count” the consideration of the TIC charges and the conviction history to arrive at the appropriate “starting point” sentences for the proceeded charges. Overall, I found the Prosecution’s approach to be reasonable in the circumstances. The Prosecution had, in their sentencing submissions, correctly taken into account the various aggravating factors and accorded sufficient weight in calling for the stated uplifts in sentence as a preliminary exercise, and the final landing in the appropriate sentence to be finally meted out.</a></p><a id="p1_25"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When considering sentence, I took note of the fact that (voluntary) alcohol intoxication had apparently been the source of much of the criminal activity of the Accused. The Accused had shown poor control over his alcohol consumption. Whilst there had been periods of good progress, ultimately, the Accused lapsed back to his old ways. The public has to be protected from the criminal actions of the Accused.</a></p><a id="p1_26"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of <em>Sim Yeow Kee</em> involved two appellants appealing against sentences of CT meted out to them (the two cases were not related to each other). For one of the appellants, Sim Yeow Kee, his sentence of seven year’s CT was set aside by the High Court and Sim was instead sentenced to 42 months’ imprisonment. The High Court considered that the minimum term of five years’ CT (let alone the seven years which the district judge had imposed) would be “<em>unduly</em> disproportionate” to the “likely imprisonment sentence” of (total) 42 months. It has to be emphasised here that the appellant Sim Yeow Kee’s indicative 42 months’ imprisonment sentence was <em>far lower</em> than the (minimum) five year (60 months) CT term. The scenario in our present case differs from the situation in the appeal of Sim Yeow Kee, as even the minimum sentences (and the running of only two sentences consecutively) here would far exceed the minimum CT period of five years. As can be seen from the earlier discussion, substantial uplifts from the mandatory minimum sentences for the proceeded charges were called for, in our present case.</a></p><a id="p1_27"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the other appellant involved in <em>Sim Yeow Kee</em>, one Loi Wenda, the High Court dismissed the appeal. Loi had been sentenced to five years’ CT. The High Court was of the view that the (total) “likely imprisonment sentence” for Loi would be 78 months’ imprisonment (equivalent to six years and six months). The High Court found that Loi was a “<em>persistent habitual offender</em>”. The High Court “would have been prepared to find that <em>at least</em> six years’ CT should have been imposed on Loi because of the extent of his criminal record and the evident need for him to be specifically deterred.” (<em>Sim Yeow Kee</em> at [118]). The sentence of five years’ CT in Loi’s case was affirmed. In Loi’s case, a CT term of six years (equivalent to 72 months) would have been appropriate where the “likely imprisonment sentence” was 78 months. As indicated above, the Prosecution’s submission of 12 years’ imprisonment as the Indicative Regular Imprisonment Sentence was fair and reasonable. Hence, a CT sentence of 10 years is appropriate and justifiable.</a></p><a id="p1_28"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The High Court in <em>Sim Yeow Kee</em> (at [16] and [38]) identified one material difference between “regular imprisonment” and CT. A person sentenced to “regular imprisonment” was “entitled to remission on serving two-thirds of his aggregate term of imprisonment”. A CT inmate was not entitled to remission of the sentence but “may be considered for ROL (release on licence) once he has completed two-thirds of his sentence”.</a></p><a id="p1_29"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the appellant Loi, the High Court (at [117] of <em>Sim Yeow Kee</em>) stated “… the fact that Loi would not be entitled to ROL as of right if he were sentenced to CT would enhance the prospect of specifically deterring him.”</a></p><a id="p1_30"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, there is also a very strong need to specifically deter the Accused from further criminal activity. As demonstrated earlier, his criminal activities span a wide spectrum of offending. He has negatively affected the lives of several victims in his wake. He has committed serious property offences and offences involving violence against the person. There was clearly a need to impose a sentence of sufficient severity to specifically deter the Accused as well as to send a stern message that offending of the nature and scope as seen in the present case will be met with a deterrent sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_31"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All considered, the Accused was sentenced to CT for a term of 10 years, with effect from the date of remand, 29 June 2018, and a total of 16 strokes of the cane.</a></p><a id="p1_32"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to record my thanks to Deputy Public Prosecutors Chin Jincheng and Chong Yong, and previous Defence Counsels Jeanny Ng and Luke Lee for their respective conduct and submissions in this matter.</a></p><a id="p1_33"> </a></div></content></html>
