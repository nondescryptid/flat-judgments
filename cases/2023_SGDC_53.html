The Appellant withdrew DC 3233 at the trial stage after the Respondent had agreed to his request to waive costs.

Such a judgment may be entered if the facts and law needed to determine the claims are not in dispute.

If he fails to do so, then his application will be dismissed with costs. If the plaintiff can show that he has a <em>prima facie</em> case, then the defendant must establish that there is a fair or reasonable possibility that he has a real or <em>bona fide</em> defence. If the court finds that the defence is not credible after having regard to its consistency with contemporaneous documents, its inherent plausibility, and other compelling evidence, then the plaintiff is entitlement to summary judgement: <em>Goh Chok Tong v Chee Soon Juan</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2003] 3 SLR(R) 0032.xml')">[2003] 3 SLR(R) 32</a> at [25].</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Section 9(1)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying these principles to the present case, the first step is to assess whether the Appellant has made out a <em>prima facie</em> case that s 9(1) of the MVA applies. This section stipulates the following:</a></p><a id="p1_10"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>Duty of insurers to satisfy judgments </b> <b><em>against persons insured </em></b> <b>in respect of third-party risks</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.—(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to this section, if after a certificate of insurance has been issued under section 4(9) <em>to the person</em> by whom a policy has been effected, judgment in respect of any liability required to be covered by a policy under section 4(1)(b) (being a liability covered by the terms of the policy) is obtained against <em>any person insured by the policy</em>, then, <em>even though the insurer may be entitled to avoid or cancel or may have avoided or cancelled the policy</em>, the following apply to the insurer: …</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose and effect of s 9(1) has been helpfully summarised in <em>Er Kee Jeng v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2006] 2 SLR(R) 0485.xml')">[2006] 2 SLR(R) 485</a> as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;… Section 9 was enacted to confer upon the third party a direct cause of action against the insurer, a right which did not exist under common law: <em>Nippon Fire and Marine Insurance Co Ltd v Sim Jin Hwee</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1998] 2 SLR(R) 0077.xml')">[1998] 2 SLR(R) 77</a> at [14]. It creates a <em>statutory</em> relationship between the insurer and the third party, which exists irrespective of the <em>contractual</em> position <em>vis-à-vis</em> the insurer and the insured. In order to be discharged from its liabilities under s 9, the insurer must adopt the procedures set out in ss 9(3) to 9(5), which were intended to give third parties adequate notice that the insurer had disclaimed not only its contractual obligations to the insured, but also its statutory obligations to the third party. Failure to follow these procedures only entails the insurer’s continued liability under statute and not contract. …</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a plain reading of s 9(1), the Appellant must satisfy four requirements before that provision is engaged.</a></p><a id="p1_12"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Three requirements satisfied</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Appellant must show that a certificate of insurance under s 4(9) of the MVA has been issued vis-à-vis the Vehicle.

The second are persons who drive the Vehicle <em>with Elitez’s permission</em>.

No other document is referred and rightly so because the Policy Schedule does not define “authorized driver”. If Liberty intends Pang to be excluded for insurance coverage it must be made known in the COI. It must therefore follow that whether Pang is entitled to drive is based on the information written [wording] in the COI.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not find the Appellant’s submission to be compelling – for the simple reason that Endorsements V0132 and V0065 appear in the Schedule <em>to the</em> certificate of insurance. The word “schedule” ordinarily means an appendix to a document containing a list of items that affects the contents of the document.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a> In other words, <em>these two endorsements are part of the certificate</em>. It also bears noting that s 4(9) – which stipulates the requirement for a certificate of insurance to be in the prescribed form – expressly recognises that a policy may be subject to certain “conditions”. In the case of the Policy, the particulars of these conditions are set out in the Schedule to the certificate<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> as well as Policy Jacket.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the above, the Appellant maintained his submission that Clause 6 is conclusive on whether Pang was an authorized driver – and since Endorsements V0065 and V0132 do not appear in Clause 6, they are irrelevant to the issue. According to the Appellant, the certificate is often relied by the Police to quickly determine whether a driver is authorized to drive a vehicle and hence covered by insurance.</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am unable to accept the Appellant’s submission. It bears emphasis that the Appellant’s case for the Application and appeal is based on s 9(1) of the MVA. There is nothing in s 9(1) to suggest that a determination of who an authorized driver is must be confined only to the clauses in a certificate of insurance. Although s 9(1) refers to a “certificate of insurance”, it is <em>merely for the purpose of triggering</em> the statutory duty under that provision.</a></p><a id="p1_25"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary – based on a proper construction of the Policy terms, I find that the Appellant has failed to show that the Policy extended to Pang. Endorsement V0065 makes it abundantly clear that Alpha’s sub-letting of the Vehicle to Pang is not permitted. The Appellant’s submission that Pang is covered under the Policy ignores the unequivocal language in Endorsement V0065 and V0132.

In that case, the errant driver was <em>under driving suspension</em> when he caused an accident. The insurer’s liability to third parties covered “authorized driver[s]” provided that they were “permitted in accordance with the licensing or other laws or regulations to drive the motor vehicle”. The court held that the errant driver was <em>not an authorised driver for the purposes of the policy</em> and was thus not a “person insured by the policy”. On that basis, the court held that the insurer was not required by s 9(1) to satisfy the judgment entered against the errant driver: <em>Cosmic Insurance</em> at [10] – [14].

In that case, the appellant – who was the husband of the registered owner of a vehicle – had rented out the vehicle to a third party. The vehicle had an insurance policy which explicitly stated that it did not cover “[u]se for hire or reward”. The appellant contended that the insurance policy was in force despite the non-coverage of use for hire or reward because s 9(1) of the MVA obliged the insurer to satisfy judgments in favour of third parties against him. The High Court rejected this contention, holding that s 9(1) was not applicable as there was no insurance policy in force when the vehicle was used for hire or reward:</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statutory language of s 9(1) of the Act indicates that the subsection <em>only applies to a “liability covered by the terms of the policy”</em>.
