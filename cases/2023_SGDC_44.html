Subsequently, just before the trial commenced, parties informed the court that the accused was considering pleading guilty. While his apparent change of mind about claiming trial to his charges was made at a late stage, I agreed for parties to be given time to consider whether a plea bargain for all the charges could be struck. Eventually, after considerable time spent in discussions between counsel for the accused and the prosecutors from Singapore Customs and the Land Transport Authority (collectively “<b>the Prosecution</b>”) on the charges to proceed and the contents of the relevant documents, the accused agreed to plead guilty to a total of 26 charges (“<b>proceeded charges</b>”), and to consent to the remaining 86 charges being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing (“<b>TIC charges</b>”).</a></p><a id="p1_3"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proceeded charges consisted of the following:</a></p><a id="p1_4"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4"></a><a id="p1_4-p2_1">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12 charges under section 128D Customs Act p/u section 128L(2) of the Customs Act for the fraudulent evasion of excise duties under the Customs Act.

For each motor car, the accused applied for an assessment of the motor car’s customs value by completing and submitting a Declaration of Facts for Assessment of Motor Vehicle (“<b>DOF</b>”), together with supporting documents, to the Tariffs and Trade Services Branch of Singapore Customs (“<b>Customs TTSB</b>”). The DOF stated the make and model, and purchase price of the motor car.

After completing their review of the DOF, Customs TTSB would notify the accused of the approved customs value of the motor car. The accused would thereafter instruct his declaring agent, Oscars Logistics Pte Ltd (“<b>Oscars Logistics</b>”) to declare the duty payment permit and pay the applicable excise duty. At the material time of the offences, excise duty was levied at a rate of 20% of the customs value of imported motor cars.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to the 12 Excise Duty charges that he pleaded guilty to, the accused had, through his declaring agent, Oscar Logistics, submitted DOFs whereby he declared customs value of the imported motor cars at values other than their true values.</a></p><a id="p1_11"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with his offences, the accused had also obtained from the overseas supplier of the motor cars commercial invoices with values lower than the actual purchase prices of the motor cars. He had submitted these false invoices as supporting documents in the DOF submitted to Customs TTSB. Consequently, the approved customs values of the motor cars were lower than their actual purchase prices, and the accused thereby paid lower excise duties than the actual excise duties otherwise payable for those motor cars.</a></p><a id="p1_12"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brief overview of the 12 Excise Duty charges, including the excise duty that he evaded through his actions, are set out below.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="9.34862869198312%"><col width="14.9525316455696%"><col width="18.6972573839662%"><col width="11.207805907173%"><col width="18.6972573839662%"><col width="27.0965189873418%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>S/no.</b> </p> </td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Charge No.</b> </p> </td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Number of submissions/dates</b> </p> </td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>No of motorcars</b> </p> </td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Duty Evaded</b> </p> </td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Remarks</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p> </td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1<sup>st</sup> Charge -

One charge was tendered per vehicle as the charges were not amalgamated. The offender was sentenced to 2 weeks’ imprisonment per charge. Using <em>Ang Wee Tat Vida</em> as a starting point, the Prosecution in the present case argued that there should be a significant uplift for each proceeded charge to 8 weeks’ imprisonment, and for the global sentence to be 24 weeks’ imprisonment, in light of the following aggravating factors that were present here:</a></p><a id="p1_24-p2_1"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_24-p2_1"></a><a id="p1_24-p2_1-p3_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax evaded, or the ARF shortfall in this case was $11,525,020.00.

Counsel also argued that that based on a recent decision in the case of <em>Lin Junjiang</em> (9 March 2022), in respect of the RTA charges in the present case, the Authority should only proceed with the ARF shortfall for the proceeded charges and not for all the other charges.

Since the duty evaded in the present case was only 20% of the duty evaded in <em>Lin Junjiang’s</em> case. counsel argued that the accused in the present case should only be sentenced to a fine of $2,029,990, in default 15 months’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_27-p2_1-p3_ii"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_27-p2_1-p3_ii"></a><a id="p1_27-p2_1-p3_iii">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, counsel also emphasised that the principle of totality should apply to the fines imposed on the accused in the present case.</a></p><a id="p1_27-p2_1-p3_iii"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_1-p3_iii"></a><a id="p1_27-p2_2">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the RTA charges, counsel sought a fine of $2,000 per charge, rather than a custodial sentence, arguing that the RTA charges related to the same vehicles as those involved in the Excise Duty charges. Counsel further submitted that a custodial sentence was imposed in <em>Ang Wee Tat Vida</em> only because the offender there also faced a forgery charge involving forged letters purportedly issued by the Singapore Customs.

This totalled $373,561.80 in relation to the undercharged tax in respect of all 47 RTA charges, including the TIC charges (see [45] of <em>Ang Wee Tat Vida</em>).

In this regard, the current tax regime is largely an honours based system dependant on importers of vehicles to declare and furnish documents containing information which were accurate and true. The low risk and high reward nature of such offences, coupled with the difficulty in their detection, meant that fines would be a mere slap on the wrist for such offenders. Further, the offenders, sentenced in this manner, would consider the risk of being caught worth taking.</a></p><a id="p1_37-p2_1"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_1"></a><a id="p1_37-p2_2">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was clearly a public interest in ensuring the effective enforcement of our vehicle ownership control measures and the protection of public revenue. The ARF and other vehicle ownership taxes, are crucial components of our car ownership control measures which seek to moderate the growth of the vehicle population, and the offender here had frustrated the effective enforcement of these measures. The courts have consistently held that in cases where the offences compromised the administration and effectiveness of government policies, a deterrent sentence was warranted, especially as such offences caused significant loss to the public purse with the attendant enrichment of the offender’s own pockets.</a></p><a id="p1_37-p2_2"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_2"></a><a id="p1_37-p2_3">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offender had obtained an undue advantage over law abiding motor traders, and he was motivated by the prospect of financial gain.</a></p><a id="p1_37-p2_3"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_3"></a><a id="p1_37-p2_4">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offences spanned a long period of time.</a></p><a id="p1_37-p2_4"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_4"></a><a id="p1_37-p2_5">(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite apart from the 15 proceeded charges, 32 other charges were taken into consideration for sentencing.</a></p><a id="p1_37-p2_5"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37-p2_5"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court also opined that there was no incongruity in imposing imprisonment sentences for the RTA charges, while imposing fines for the Excise Duty (and GST) charges, as the different types of charges addressed wholly different interests.</a></p><a id="p1_38"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Decision on Sentence in the present case</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Excise Duty Charges</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As rightly pointed out by the Prosecution, for offences involving the evasion of customs duty and GST, the relevant sentencing principles are deterrence and retribution.

In the present case, the accused had even utilised a third party to facilitate the commission of the offences, when he instructed his declaring agent, Oscars Logistics, to declare the duty payment permit and to pay the applicable excise duty.

On the last point, as was made clear by the Court of Appeal in <em>PP v UI [2008]</em> 4 SLR(R), 500 (“<b><em>UI</em></b><em>”</em>) at [38]:</a></p><a id="p1_41-p2_4-p3_v"> <p class="Judg-Quote-3"> <b><em>But, if there are TIC offences to be taken into account, the effect, in general, would be that the sentence which the court would otherwise have imposed for the offences proceeded with would be increased</em></b> (see Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2003) at p 77). This is commonsensical as the offender, by agreeing to have the TIC offences in question taken into consideration for sentencing purposes, has in substance admitted that he committed those offences. <b><em>This would a fortiori be the case where the TIC offences and the offences proceeded with are similar in nature</em></b> (e.g., if both sets of offences consist of sexual offences against the same victim).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-3"></p><div align="right">[emphasis added]</div><p></p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41-p2_4-p3_v"></a><a id="p1_42">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, in light of the sentencing considerations that apply for such offences, as well as the similarities between the circumstances and sentencing factors in the present case and <em>Ang Wee Tat Vida</em>, and bearing in mind the fact that the decision in <em>Ang Wee Tat Vida</em> was ultimately endorsed by the High Court when it dismissed the appeal against sentence, I was of the view that the fine imposed in the present case should be at least ten times of the excuse duty evaded, the latter being the multiplier applied in <em>Ang Wee Tat Vida</em> in sentencing.</a></p><a id="p1_42"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a><a id="p1_43">43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I would add that the circumstances of the present case were even more aggravating than those in <em>Ang Wee Tat Vida</em>. These would support the Prosecution’s argument that the multiplier that should be applied here to determine the fines to be imposed, should be even more than the 10 times of the excise duty evaded that was applied in <em>Ang Wee Tat Vida</em>. The more aggravating aspects of the present case included the following:</a></p><a id="p1_43"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43"></a><a id="p1_43-p2_1">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scale of the offences was much greater, and hence, the amount of excise duties fraudulently evaded was significantly higher in the present case than was the case in <em>Ang Wee Tat Vida</em>. Specifically, based on the tables put up by the Prosecution (summarised at [22] above), the excise duty evaded in the present case totalled $1,504,364.45, consisting of $202,995.52 for the 12 proceeded charges and $1,301,368.93 for the TIC charges. This was much higher than the total amount of $74,712.39 that was fraudulently evaded in <em>Ang Wee Tat Vida</em>, which consisted of only $41,859.17 for the proceeded charges, and $32,853.22 for the TIC charges.</a></p><a id="p1_43-p2_1"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_1"></a><a id="p1_43-p2_2">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further while the GST charges were not amongst the proceeded charges in the present case, and were only taken into consideration for sentencing here, nonetheless they were still relevant for sentencing being TIC charges. For these GST charges, the amount involved in the present case was also much higher at $631,812.26, and this sum dwarfed the amount of $31,342.12 of GST evaded in <em>Ang Wee Tat Vida.</em></a></p><a id="p1_43-p2_2"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_2"></a><a id="p1_43-p2_3">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, five of the 12 proceeded Excise Duty charges here were amalgamated charges. These meant that each of these five charges involved more than one incident of fraudulent evasion of duty. In addition, three of these five amalgamated charges were subject to enhanced punishment of two times the maximum prescribed punishment by virtue of ss 124(4) and 124(8)(a)(ii) of the CPC. Section 124(8)(a)(ii) reads:</a></p><a id="p1_43-p2_3"> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">Subject to subsection (7), where a charge is framed under subsection (2) or (4), and a person is convicted specified in that charge –</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><em>The court may sentence that person</em></b> –</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-4">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in any case where the charge is framed under subsection (4) – <b><em>to 2 times the amount of punishment to which that person would otherwise have been liable</em></b> if that person had been charged with and convicted <b><em>of any of one of the incidents of commission</em></b>;-“</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-4"></p><div align="right">[emphasis added]</div><p></p> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_43-p2_3"></a><a id="p1_43-p2_3-p3_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, the case of <em>Ang Wee Tat Vida</em> did not involve any amalgamated charge, and hence there was no equivalent provision for the court there to impose any form of enhanced sentence on the offender.</a></p><a id="p1_43-p2_3-p3_i"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_43-p2_3-p3_i"></a><a id="p1_43-p2_3-p3_ii">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the legislative effect of ss 124(4) and 124(8)(a)(ii) of the CPC, it was recently explained by Vincent Hoong J in <em>PP v Oskar Song Hauming and another appeal</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/26962-SSP.xml')">[2021] 5 SLR 965</a> (“<b><em>Oskar Song Hauming</em></b>”) at [68] that:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-3">In line with Menon CJ’s observation in <em>Poh Boon Kiat</em>, <b><em>ss 124(4) and 124(8)(a)(ii) of the CPC collectively signal the serious view Parliament takes of courses of criminal conduct which form the basis of an amalgamated offence in s 124(4).</em></b> Therefore, it must be significant that the court’s sentencing jurisdiction is doubled under s 124(8)(<em>a</em>)(ii) of the CPC where s 124(4) amalgamated charges are concerned.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-3"></p><div align="right">[emphasis added]</div><p></p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="">Further at [69] of the same case, Hoong J opined that:</a></p><a id=""> <p class="Judg-Quote-3">[69]….amalgamation may be used to <b>signal the higher&nbsp;</b><b><em>criminality</em></b><b>&nbsp;of the accused&nbsp;and the gravity of the course of criminal conduct.</b></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-3"></p><div align="right">[emphasis added]</div><p></p> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_43-p2_3-p3_iii">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, I was of the view that all things being equal, and especially in the case of an amalgamated charge which sets out a significant number of incidents of fraudulent evasion, and which was also punishable with an “enhanced sentence” under ss 124(4) and 124(8)(a)(ii) of the CPC, such a charge should attract a sentence that reflects “…the higher&nbsp;<em>criminality</em>&nbsp;of the accused&nbsp;and the gravity of the course of criminal conduct” (as per Hoong J at [69] of <em>Oskar Song Hauming</em>). As noted above, there were three such charges proceeded with in the present case.</a></p><a id="p1_43-p2_3-p3_iii"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_3-p3_iii"></a><a id="p1_43-p2_4">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the accused here only pleaded guilty after trial dates had already been fixed, and witnesses had been called to attend court. This situation was in contrast to that in <em>Ang Wee Tat Vida</em> where the offender had pleaded guilty without a trial being fixed. Accordingly, while I took into account the accused’s plea of guilt in the present case in deciding sentence, I was of the view that any sentencing discount that should be given to the accused, would have to take into account the late stage at which the plea of guilt was made by him, and also the fact that trial dates had been set aside, trial preparations had been made, and the witnesses had already been lined up to testify.</a></p><a id="p1_43-p2_4"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43-p2_4"></a><a id="p1_44">44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light the above considerations, I was of the view that the <b><em>overall</em></b> fine to be imposed, should be even more than 10 times of the total excise duty evaded. As such, I applied a multiplier of 11 times for one of the more serious Excise Duty charges, which was the amalgamated charge in DAC-921422-2020, as that charge involved the fraudulent evasion of excise duties on 33 occasions, in respect of a total of 65 vehicles. For that charge, I was of the view that a fine equivalent to 11 times that of the excise duty evaded was warranted.</a></p><a id="p1_44"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a><a id="p1_45">45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other charges, bearing in mind the hefty amount of excuse duties evaded, and the relatively high fine that would result even if I just imposed a fine of 10 times the excise duty evaded for each remaining charge, and in order to ensure proportionality and to prevent a crushing sentence, I only applied the same multiplier used in <em>Ang Wee Tat Vida</em> of a fine equivalent to 10 times that of the excise duty evaded.</a></p><a id="p1_45"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a><a id="p1_46">46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for determining the length of default imprisonment term for each charge, and the overall default sentence, I took note of the submissions of parties, and the guidance from the default sentences imposed in <em>Ang Wee Tat Vida</em>.

However, I ultimately did not find the case of <em>Lin Junjiang</em> to be of much assistance in sentencing.</a></p><a id="p1_50"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50"></a><a id="p1_50-p2_1">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, <em>Lin Junjiang</em> was an unreported decision. In this regard, it is trite law that unreported decisions are of relatively little, if any, precedential value (see <em>Keeping Mark John v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21201-SSP.xml')">[2017] 5 SLR 627</a> (“<b><em>Keeping Mark John</em></b>”) at [18]).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_2">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it would appear that the facts of <em>Lin Junjiang</em> were a lot less aggravating than those in the current case, as that case only involved two proceeded charges; one charge for fraudulent evasion of excise duties (of $724,607.98), and one charge for a similar RTA offence (involving ARF shortfall of $567,594 for 67 vehicles). There was also only one TIC charge for a GST offence. In contrast, the total amount of excise duties involved in the present case was $1,504,364.45 (for both the proceeded and TIC charges for the Excise Duty offences), and the total ARF shortfall here was $$11,525,020 (for both the proceeded and TIC charges for the RTA offences involving a total of 932 vehicles).</a></p><a id="p1_50-p2_2"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_2"></a><a id="p1_50-p2_3">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, none of the charges in <em>Lin Junjiang</em> were read with s 124(8)(a)(ii) of the CPC, and hence did not attract any form of enhanced punishment. In contrast, as noted above, a significant number of charges tendered against the accused in the present case could potentially have attracted higher punishments in light of the operation of s 124(8)(a)(ii) of the CPC.</a></p><a id="p1_50-p2_3"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50-p2_3"></a><a id="p1_51">51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the decision in <em>Lin Junjiang</em> was not helpful in deciding the sentence in the present case, whether in relation to the Excise Duty offences, or even for the RTA offences (see also [58] below).</a></p><a id="p1_51"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">RTA charges</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a><a id="p1_52">52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to the RTA offences in the present case, I again took reference from the reported case of <em>Ang Wee Tat Vida</em> in determining sentence. There, the court imposed a sentence of 2 weeks’ imprisonment for each RTA charge. The total amount of tax undercharged in that case totalled $373,561.80 in respect of all 47 RTA charges, which included the 32 RTA charges that were taken into consideration for sentencing.</a></p><a id="p1_52"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a><a id="p1_53">53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with the reasoning of the court in <em>Ang Wee Tat Vida</em>, I accepted that general deterrence was the dominant sentencing consideration for such cases, as the system “…was largely an honours based system dependant on importers of vehicles, like the Accused, to declare and furnish documents containing information which were accurate and true.” (<em>Ang Wee Tat Vida</em> at [42]). In this regard, I agreed that ensuring the proper operation, implementation and collection of the ARF and other vehicle ownership taxes, was imperative in the effective control of vehicle growth and management in Singapore. Further, allowing offenders to abuse the system by under declaring the OMV of vehicles, resulting in a shortfall in the payment of ARF to the Authority, would also have the detrimental effect of causing “…significant loss to the public purse with the attendant enrichment of [the offender’s] own pockets” (<em>Ang Wee Tat Vida</em> at [41]).</a></p><a id="p1_53"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a><a id="p1_54">54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I agreed with the Prosecution that the offences in the present case were a lot more serious than those in <em>Ang Wee Tat Vida</em>. Hence the sentences to be imposed would also have to be significantly higher. Specifically, I agreed with the submission of the Prosecution that a sentence of 8 weeks’ imprisonment for each RTA charge in the present case was justified for the following reasons:</a></p><a id="p1_54"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54"></a><a id="p1_54-p2_1">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax evaded, or the ARF shortfall in the present case, was $11,525,020.00. This was much higher than the amount of tax undercharged at $373,561.80 in <em>Ang Wee Tat Vida.</em> As the Prosecution rightly pointed out, the ARF shortfall in the present case was about 30 times higher than in <em>Ang Wee Tat Vida</em>.</a></p><a id="p1_54-p2_1"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_1"></a><a id="p1_54-p2_2">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of vehicles involved in the present case was 932. This was about 19 times the total number of vehicles involved in <em>Ang Wee Tat Vida</em>.</a></p><a id="p1_54-p2_2"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_2"></a><a id="p1_54-p2_3">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RTA offences here spanned a period of nearly 3 years i.e. from 30 June 2016 to 4 June 2019 (see table at [3] of the Statement of Facts for the RTA charges). Specifically, in respect of the 14 RTA charges proceeded with in the present case, the offences were committed over the period from 30 June 2016 to 3 June 2019 (see [4] of the Statement of Facts for the RTA charges). In contrast, the offence period in <em>Ang Wee Tat Vida</em>, in respect of the proceeded charges, was only slightly more than a year i.e. from 11 January 2012 to 27 March 2013.</a></p><a id="p1_54-p2_3"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_3"></a><a id="p1_54-p2_4">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in the present case, all the 14 proceeded charges were amalgamated charges. In addition:</a></p><a id="p1_54-p2_4"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_54-p2_4"></a><a id="p1_54-p2_4-p3_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amalgamated charges encompassed multiple vehicles, ranging from 3 to 138 vehicles per charge.</a></p><a id="p1_54-p2_4-p3_i"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_54-p2_4-p3_i"></a><a id="p1_54-p2_4-p3_ii">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, eight of these 14 amalgamated charges were subjected to enhanced punishment under s124(8)(a)(ii) of the CPC in that the court may sentence the accused to <em>“2 times the amount of punishment to which [he] would otherwise have been liable if [he] had been charged with and convicted of any of one of the incidents of commission”.</em></a></p><a id="p1_54-p2_4-p3_ii"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_54-p2_4-p3_ii"></a><a id="p1_54-p2_4-p3_iii">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, as highlighted by the Prosecution, in <em>Ang Wee Tat Vida</em>, each of the charges (a total of 47 charges including TIC charges) involved only one vehicle per charge, as the charges were not amalgamated. Even then, the court imposed a sentence of 2 weeks’ imprisonment per charge.</a></p><a id="p1_54-p2_4-p3_iii"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54-p2_4-p3_iii"></a><a id="p1_55">55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards counsel’s argument that I should imposed a fine instead of a custodial sentence for each of the RTA charges, I note that there was only a narrow range of fines that could be imposed for such offences (up to $10,000, or $20,000 in the case of amalgamated charges read with s 124(8)(a)(ii) of the CPC). This meant that in the present case, the fines that could be imposed would be <em>wholly inadequate</em> when compared to the amount of tax evaded or the ARF shortfall, which ranged from a low of $17,784.00 (MSC-900428-2023) to a high of $3,133,548.00 (MSC-901801-2021). Indeed, the ARF amounts in 13 out of the 14 RTA charges already exceeded $20,000 each [see Table 2 in the Statement of Facts for the RTA charges].</a></p><a id="p1_55"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a><a id="p1_56">56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, even without considering the custodial sentences imposed in <em>Ang Wee Tat Vida</em>, which were given for much less serious charges, the imposition of a fine in the present case for any of the RTA charges was clearly a non-starter, and would hardly be a meaningful form of punishment. Nor would such a form of punishment serve as a sufficient deterrent to the accused or other would be offenders.</a></p><a id="p1_56"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a><a id="p1_57">57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the above, I agreed with the Prosecution that the appropriate sentence per RTA charge should be 8 weeks’ imprisonment. Further, in light of the various aggravating features identified above, I also agreed that three of these sentences, namely the sentences in MSC-901801-2021, MSC-901802-2021 and MSC-901822-2021, should run consecutively for a total custodial sentence of 24 weeks’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_57"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a><a id="p1_58">58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would add that even in <em>Lin Junjiang</em>, the case cited by the Defence where the ARF evaded was $567,594 and which only involved 67 vehicles set out in a single charge, and where, additionally, the charge did not attract enhanced punishment, the custodial sentence imposed was already 4 weeks’ imprisonment. In the present case, there were a total of 37 charges (14 proceeded charges and 23 TIC charges) some of which were charges that attracted enhanced punishment by virtue of s124(8)(a)(ii) of the CPC. The total ARF evaded was also of a much higher amount, and totalled a whopping $11,525,020.00 (for the 37 charges). Moreover, the RTA charges here involved a total of 932 vehicles, and the offences were committed over a period of almost 3 years (see [54] above). Under such circumstances, I was of the view that a global sentence of 24 weeks’ imprisonment was fair and appropriate.</a></p><a id="p1_58"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a><a id="p1_59">59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, to facilitate recovery of the total tax undercharged in the present case and in line with s 11(9) of the RTA, I ordered the accused to pay to the Registrar of Vehicles the amount of tax ($11,525,020.00) which was undercharged in relation to all the RTA charges. In this regard, a similar order was made in <em>Ang Wee Tat Vida</em> in relation to the ARF shortfall for all the vehicles reflected in the 47 RTA charges, including the TIC charges (see [45] of <em>Ang Wee Tat Vida</em>). I would add that such an order is also consistent with s 18 of the RTA which is for the recovery of undercharged tax by the Registrar. In any event, upon clarification, counsel confirmed that he has no issue with this order for recovery of tax that was sought by the Prosecution.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60">60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, for completeness, I would add that in arriving at my sentences for both the Excise Duty and GST charges, I did not regard the personal circumstances of the accused to be so genuinely “exceptional or extreme”, as to warrant any further discount in sentencing (see <em>Lai Oei Mui Jenny v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1993] 2 SLR(R) 0406.xml')">[1993] 2 SLR(R) 406</a> at [10] and [12]).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61">61&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the global sentence imposed on the accused for the proceeded charges was 24 weeks' imprisonment and a fine of $2,090,878.03, in default twenty-one (21) months' and thirty-two (32) weeks' imprisonment. I am of the view that this sentence is fair and proportionate. It also accords with the relevant sentencing principles and sentencing factors, and the totality principle. In addition, I ordered that the accused pay to the Registrar of Vehicles the amount of tax ($11,525,020.00) which was undercharged in relation to all the RTA charges.</a></p><a id="p1_61"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a><a id="p1_62">62&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused being dissatisfied has appealed against the sentence.
