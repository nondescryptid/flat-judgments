Her claim was that the defendant had sold his business known as Wee Wee Laundry Service (“Wee Wee”) to her for the sum of $90,000. On the defendant’s part, his counterclaim was that there was no sale for the undisputed sum of $90,000 and was instead a one year consultancy agreement for which he sought payment for the extended period of the consultancy beyond the first year in the sum of $127,500 as well as staff salaries owed by the plaintiff. The counterclaim for salaries in the sum of $72,200 was for Wee Wee staff; namely, the drivers employed by the defendant and the plaintiff’s daughter, Ang Shih Yi Vanessa (“Vanessa Ang”).</a></p><a id="p1_1"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the trial, I allowed the plaintiff’s claim in that the defendant was ordered to transfer the disputed business to the plaintiff as I had found that the payment of $90,000 by the plaintiff was an agreement for sale of Wee Wee. As for the counterclaim, I allowed the counterclaim for salaries of the drivers and Vanessa Ang for the sum of $72,200 with interest at 5.33% pa from date of writ to judgment. Having found that the payment of $90,000 was for sale of Wee Wee and not a consultancy agreement as alleged by the defendant, I dismissed the counterclaim for further consultancy sum of $127,500.</a></p><a id="p1_2"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being dissatisfied, the plaintiff has since appealed against my decision relating to the counterclaim as well as the order for each party to bear their own costs and disbursements. These are the full grounds of my decision.</a></p><a id="p1_3"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff is a businesswoman who owns and runs Chip Huat. Chip Huat is a sole proprietorship which is the business of selling and supplying cylinder liquefied gas, cylinders and diesel. Vanessa Ang, who is married to the defendant, was working for her mother in Chip Huat as well as Wee Wee at the material time.</a></p><a id="p1_4"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendant owns Wee Wee which is a sole proprietorship. It is in the business of providing laundry and dry cleaning services. The defendant had an ongoing contract with Chip Huat to supply gas to Wee Wee.</a></p><a id="p1_5"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ cases </p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s version</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the plaintiff, on 5 March 2013, the plaintiff paid the defendant the sum of $90,000 for the purpose of purchasing Wee Wee from the defendant. Despite the payment, the defendant did not transfer the legal ownership of Wee Wee to her. As Vanessa Ang was working in Wee Wee, daily sales of Wee Wee was collected and handed over by Vanessa Ang to the plaintiff. Around May or June 2015, Vanessa Ang ceased forwarding the daily sales to the plaintiff.</a></p><a id="p1_6"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff claimed that in or about May 2015, the defendant and Vanessa Ang approached the plaintiff with an offer and all parties had then agreed for Wee Wee to be sold back to the defendant for a higher sum of $140,000 but the defendant reneged on this agreement. The plaintiff sent a letter of demand seeking payment of $140,000 and to date, such payment had not been made. Therefore, the plaintiff claimed the sum of $140,000. Alternatively, the plaintiff’s claim was for Wee Wee to be legally transferred to her.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s version</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendant did not dispute that the plaintiff had paid him the sum of $90,000 and the cheque of $90,000 was made payable to OKY Pte Ltd. The defendant was a majority shareholder of OKY Pte Ltd holding 80% shares and was one of two directors of the company. OKY Pte Ltd operated a factory that did the washing, dry-cleaning of laundry for individual and small scale customers. One of OKY Pte Ltd’s customers was Wee Wee. The arrangement between OKY Pte Ltd and Wee Wee was that the laundry collected by Wee Wee would be sent to OKY Pte Ltd to launder, treat and clean. After cleaning, OKY Pte Ltd would return the laundry to Wee Wee which would deliver the laundry back to the end customers’ premises.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 2013, the plaintiff approached the defendant and Vanessa Ang to use Wee Wee to teach the plaintiff and her son, Felix Ang, on how to start up and run laundry business such as Wee Wee for one year. In this regard, the plaintiff paid the defendant $90,000 consultancy fee for a one year consultancy period from January 2013 to December 2013.</a></p><a id="p1_9"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the defendant, the terms of the consultancy agreement were:</a></p><a id="p1_10"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_10-p2_a">a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An extension of the consultancy period would entail payment of additional consultancy fees.</a></p><a id="p1_10-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_10-p2_b">b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OKY Pte Ltd would wash, clean, treat and launder the items collected by Wee Wee.</a></p><a id="p1_10-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_10-p2_c">c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for distribution of the sales proceeds collected from the customers of the business, the plaintiff was to be allocated 55% of the sales proceeds and 45% was to be paid to OKY Pte Ltd.</a></p><a id="p1_10-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_10-p2_d">d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanessa Ang and the plaintiff’s drivers would make collections of money from Wee Wee’s customers, and they would periodically hand the plaintiff the daily collections during the period of the consultancy.</a></p><a id="p1_10-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_10-p2_e">e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff would bear the costs and expenses of running the business.</a></p><a id="p1_10-p2_e"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10-p2_e"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendant pleaded that the plaintiff did not return control of the business after the one year consultancy period that ended in December 2013 and continued to collect pocket and operate the UOB bank account of Wee Wee.

In such a situation, following <em>Naughty G Pte Ltd v Fortune Marketing Pte Ltd</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22634-SSP.xml')">[2018] 5 SLR 1208</a>, I determined this issue based on evidence regarding the contemporaneous conduct of parties at the material time and an examination of the precise factual matrix.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that the plaintiff’s payment of $90,000 was for sale of Wee Wee and not for consultancy services as alleged by the defendant. I found that the business of Wee Wee was relatively simple which entailed the collection of laundry from customers which was a point agreed upon by the defendant. It was noteworthy the actual laundry cleaning that would entail more technical knowhow of a laundry business was performed by OKY Pte Ltd.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the plaintiff’s evidence that Chip Huat, which was in the gas supply business, also entailed delivery and collection of gas cylinders from customers. As such, the operations of both Chip Huat and Wee Wee were similar in this regard. Hence, I agreed with the plaintiff’s counsel that there was no need for such a consultancy agreement.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff’s conduct, when running the operations of Wee Wee, also demonstrated that she was the de facto owner of Wee Wee. There was ample evidence supporting the plaintiff’s claim that she was in charge of running the business in her capacity as the business owner.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff clearly had full control of the finances of Wee Wee as evidenced by the way money was drawn out of Wee Wee’s UOB bank account. It was the defendant’s own evidence that he even pre-signed cheques for the UOB bank account which he gave to the plaintiff<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a>. This could be seen in the numerous UOB cheques exhibited in the agreed bundle for July 2014 to May 2015<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>. It was clear that the defendant had ceded control of Wee Wee’s finances, which was the lifeblood of any business, to the plaintiff.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendant also pleaded at [14 (d)] of the Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 2) that he gave the UOB bank account to the plaintiff to operate. The plaintiff clearly operated the UOB bank account as one which belonged to her as the de facto owner of Wee Wee. She made payments from Wee Wee’s bank account for activities unrelated to the business such as UOB cheque dated 26 May 2014 which was for her personal use<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a>. Other examples were UOB cheque payment to Guan Hock Ting Eating House on 10 June 2013<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> and UOB cheque payment on 13 Nov 2014 to “NH a/c”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. The plaintiff even received the UOB bank account statements which enabled her to keep track of payments into and payments out of the UOB bank account.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not disputed that Vanessa Ang collected money from customers of Wee Wee and handed a portion to the plaintiff. If the plaintiff had not bought Wee Wee, there would be no need for her to receive a portion of the daily sales collected by Wee Wee which was likely to include profits as it was undisputed that Wee Wee was a profitable business . It was the defendant’s own evidence that the split of the daily sales was the larger share of 55% was to be paid to the plaintiff and remaining 45% to OKY Pte Ltd which performed the actual cleaning of the laundry.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that the defendant’s behaviour during the material time also showed that he acknowledged that the plaintiff was owner of Wee Wee in that he even gave copies of all delivery orders, purchase orders and invoices<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a> which enabled the plaintiff to keep track of the key operations of Wee Wee. If the defendant was only providing consultancy services, it would not be necessary to him to hand over such detailed documents to the plaintiff. His contemporaneous behaviour suggested that he had acknowledged that the plaintiff was in fact the owner of Wee Wee.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendant claimed that the parties had entered into a one year consultancy agreement which ended after December 2013. It was not disputed that the plaintiff continued to run Wee Wee even after December 2013. I agreed with the plaintiff that the despite not being paid for the allegedly extended consultancy period of January 2014 to May 2015, the defendant continued to allow the plaintiff to collect payments from customers was because he had sold the business to the plaintiff. The defendant did not provide any satisfactory explanation as to why he allowed the plaintiff to continue to operate Wee Wee for well over one year after the alleged expiry of the first year of consultancy without the plaintiff having paid the additional consultancy fee.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having found that the plaintiff’s payment of $90,000 was for sale of Wee Wee, it followed that the plaintiff was not liable for further consultancy fees of $127,500 which formed part of the defendant’s counterclaim. Accordingly, I dismissed the defendant’s counterclaim for further consultancy fees for the period of January 2015 to May 2015.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 2- Was there a subsequent agreement for the defendant to buy back Wee Wee from the plaintiff for $140,000?</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff’s claim for $140,000 was pleaded in [9] of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) as the price for the plaintiff to agree to the condition that she would lay no ownership claims against Wee Wee. The plaintiff had sought $140,000 or alternatively, Wee Wee to be transferred to the plaintiff.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that the plaintiff had not proven that there was an agreement for the defendant to buy back Wee Wee. It was undisputed that there was no written proof of such an agreement. There were only 3 witnesses who gave evidence in court; namely the plaintiff, the defendant and Felix Ang. Felix Ang testified that he had no knowledge of the purported agreement to sell back Wee Wee to the defendant. As such, this court only had the plaintiff’s bare assertion that this was the position.</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff’s evidence in court was that she only wanted to help the defendant, who was then Vanessa Ang’s boyfriend, by buying Wee Wee in the first place. In my view, it did not make sense for the plaintiff to sell back the business to the defendant for a higher sum of $140,000 if her intention was to help her daughter. As I had found that there was no subsequent agreement for the defendant to buy back Wee Wee from the plaintiff, I made the order that the legal ownership of Wee Wee be transferred to the plaintiff.</a></p><a id="p1_25"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, the plaintiff had not appealed against my decision not to find in favour of the plaintiff in respect of her claim that there was a subsequent agreement for Wee Wee to be bought back by the defendant. To recapitulate, in the Notice of Appeal filed by the plaintiff, her appeal was against my decision to partially allow the counterclaim for salaries of the Wee Wee staff to be paid to the defendant and my decision for each party to bear their own costs.</a></p><a id="p1_26"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 3- Was the plaintiff liable for payment of salaries of the Wee Wee staff, namely, the drivers and Vanessa Ang? </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I had found that the oral agreement was for sale of Wee Wee to the plaintiff and the plaintiff agreed that she was the running the business beyond December 2013, it followed that the plaintiff would be liable for payment of salaries of the workers; namely, the drivers and Vanessa Ang. This finding would be consistent with [8c] of the plaintiff’s AEIC<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a> in which she stated that 45% of the business daily collection was used to pay OKY Pte Ltd for their laundry washing services and 55% was to pay salaries of Wee Wee’s employees and other expenses.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendant adduced documentary proof in the form of payment slips of the drivers and Vanessa Ang to substantiate his counterclaim for such salaries. In court, he testified that such payments were indeed paid out of Wee Wee’s daily sales before the money was paid to the plaintiff<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a>. The plaintiff’s counsel pointed out that the drivers’ salary vouchers<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> did not state that they were drivers working for Wee Wee and two of such Vouchers<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> did not contain a signature at the “prepared by” and “approved by” rows. The plaintiff’ counsel also pointed out that the Payment Vouchers for Vanessa Ang<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> did not have a signature to show who prepared and approved the payments.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was undisputed that the plaintiff had paid some of Wee Wee’s staff salaries and expenses. In Court, the plaintiff conceded that in principle, she should be paying for salaries of Wee Wee’s staff<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a>. I accepted the defendant’s explanation that these were contemporaneous documents in the form of payment slips that were used for internal reference and I found that since Wee Wee was a small business, such documents would not be so detailed as one would expect from an audited company. Hence, I found that the plaintiff was liable to pay the defendant for salaries for 29 months from January 2013 to May 2015 totalling $72,200.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the above reasons, I decided to allow the plaintiff’s alternative claim as well as to partially allow the defendant’s counterclaim. After hearing parties on their submissions relating to costs and disbursements, I made the order that each party was to bear their own costs and disbursements as each party had succeeded on their alternative claim and part of the counterclaim respectively.</a></p><a id="p1_30"> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"></a><p class="Footnote"><a id="p1_30"><sup></sup></a><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a>ABD pg 13-39</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>2 AB pg 1173-1179</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>2 AB pg 1172</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>2 AB pg 1163</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_5_1" id="Ftn_5">[note: 5]</a></sup>2 AB pg 1176</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_6_1" id="Ftn_6">[note: 6]</a></sup>ABD pg 256-1171</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_7_1" id="Ftn_7">[note: 7]</a></sup>1 AB pg 5</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_8_1" id="Ftn_8">[note: 8]</a></sup>Transcript for Day 2, pg 4</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_9_1" id="Ftn_9">[note: 9]</a></sup>DB pg 1-14</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_10_1" id="Ftn_10">[note: 10]</a></sup>DB pg 7-8</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_11_1" id="Ftn_11">[note: 11]</a></sup>DB pg 15-42</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_12_1" id="Ftn_12">[note: 12]</a></sup>Transcript for Day 1, pg 37</p></div></content></html>
