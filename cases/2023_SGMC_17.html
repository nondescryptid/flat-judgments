The Prosecution asserted that it was. The Defence submitted otherwise. This was one of two key issues that the Court had to decide in this particular case.</a></p><a id="p1_1"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused, Jeyaseelan s/o Loganathan @ Abdul Ghani (“Jeyaseelan”) was involved in a dispute with one Goh Kok Beng (“Goh”) on 4 April 2020 at the junction of Sengkang West Road and Sengkang West Avenue. Jeyaseelan committed two criminal acts against Goh on that date. Jeyaseelan committed a rash act, endangering the personal safety of Goh, by accelerating vehicle SKU5889D (“Jeyaseelan’s car” or “his car”, depending on the context) and driving forward, knowing that Goh was standing in front of Jeyaseelan’s car. Jeyaseelan had also used vulgarities against Goh, with intent to cause harassment to Goh, and did cause harassment to Goh.</a></p><a id="p1_2"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeyaseelan pleaded guilty before me to a Charge for the rash act (endangering the personal safety of Goh) of accelerating and driving forward despite knowing that Goh was standing in front of Jeyaseelan’s car. This was punishable under s 336(a) of the Penal Code. Jeyaseelan admitted to another Charge, for the harassment caused to Goh (an offence punishable under s 3(2) of the Protection from Harassment Act), and consented to this other Charge being taken into consideration (“TIC”) for purposes of sentencing.</a></p><a id="p1_3"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contents of the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) were admitted by Jeyaseelan, without qualification, save for one particular assertion by the Prosecution. This was contained in the SOF and was part of paragraph 6 therein. This assertion was contained in a single sentence: “When the accused accelerated his car forward, the accused’s car hit the victim.” The terms “accused” and “victim” referred to Jeyaseelan and Goh, respectively. Jeyaseelan’s version was that when he moved forward, his car did not hit Goh.</a></p><a id="p1_4"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the second of the key issues before me. This disputed assertion did not affect the plea of guilt that Jeyaseelan was entering, but would be material for sentencing. Thus, a Newton hearing was conducted before me. At the conclusion of the Newton hearing, and after hearing submissions from the Deputy Public Prosecutor (“DPP”) and the Defence Counsel (“DC”), I found that the Prosecution had proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that when Jeyaseelan accelerated forward, his car had hit Goh.</a></p><a id="p1_5"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the mitigation plea from the Defence, and the respective sentencing submissions by the Prosecution and the Defence, I found that this was indeed an episode of road rage. I sentenced Jeyaseelan to imprisonment for a term of four weeks, and disqualified him from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes of vehicles for a period of six months with effect from the date of release from prison (“DQ Order”).</a></p><a id="p1_6"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeyaseelan appealed against the finding pursuant to the Newton hearing as well as the sentence imposed. Jeyaseelan is currently on bail pending appeal. Execution of the sentence (as well as the DQ Order) have been stayed pending the hearing of the appeal.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in [4], Jeyaseelan admitted to the contents of the SOF without qualification (save for the disputed assertion). I shall recite the material portions of the SOF, quoting <em>verbatim</em> where necessary.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incident occurred on 4 April 2020. On that date, at about 1.20 pm, Goh was driving his car SLX2148B along Sengkang West Road in the “rightmost lane”. Jeyaseelan was driving his car along Sengkang West Road in the “second-rightmost lane”.</a></p><a id="p1_9"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Goh was approaching the junction of Sengkang West Road and Sengkang West Avenue, Jeyaseelan then “turned on his signal indicating his intention to change to the rightmost lane before swerving into (Goh’s) lane. (Goh) had to perform an emergency brake as a result.”</a></p><a id="p1_10"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeyaseelan and Goh stopped their respective vehicles at the red traffic light at the junction of Sengkang West Road and Sengkang West Avenue. “Unhappy with how (Jeyaseelan) had swerved into his lane, Goh got out of his car and approached (Jeyaseelan). (Jeyaseelan) likewise got out of his car.” Jeyaseelan and Goh then “got into a verbal dispute” (and this was the subject of the TIC Charge).</a></p><a id="p1_11"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SOF went on to recite that “After the verbal dispute, (Jeyaseelan) got back inside his car to leave the scene. (Goh) was standing in front of (Jeyaseelan’s car) when (Jeyaseelan) entered his car. (Goh) stood close to the front of (Jeyaseelan’s car) as he intended to prevent (Jeyaseelan) from leaving. When the traffic light at the junction turned green, (Jeyaseelan) committed a rash act, by accelerating his car and driving forward, thereby endangering the personal safety of (Goh), despite knowing that (Goh) was standing in front of (Jeyaseelan’s car).”</a></p><a id="p1_12"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next sentence in the SOF at paragraph 6 contained the disputed assertion, “When (Jeyaseelan) accelerated his car forward, (Jeyaseelan’s car) hit (Goh).” which was the subject matter of the Newton hearing. There could be no dispute with the first part of the sentence (“When (Jeyaseelan) accelerated his car forward,”) as Jeyaseelan admitted to that part of the SOF that stated that he had accelerated his car and drove forward, endangering the personal safety of Goh. What was residually in dispute was whether, in accelerating his car forward, Jeyaseelan’s car had hit Goh.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SOF continued, “After this, (Jeyaseelan) accelerated his car again to drive off. (Goh) managed to move aside as (Jeyaseelan) drove off.” Thereafter, Goh “sought medical assistance on 5 April 2020 and was diagnosed with a knee sprain, an ankle sprain and a pelvic brim contusion.” Goh was given medical leave for four days (from 5<sup>th</sup> to 8<sup>th</sup> April 2020).</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Newton hearing, Goh was called as the sole witness for the Prosecution. Jeyaseelan was the sole witness for the Defence. The following documents were admitted into evidence: the medical report and medical certificate relating to Goh, and the video footage of the incident (submitted by the Prosecution), and the long statement and cautioned statements of Jeyaseelan (submitted by the Defence). The video footage was played in Court.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goh’s evidence was that the reason why he had walked in front of Jeyaseelan’s car was that he (Goh) was “trying to call the police”, and had “subconsciously” walked to the front of Jeyaseelan’s car. Goh said that he was approximately 30 cm away from the front of Jeyaseelan’s car. The action of Jeyaseelan’s car being accelerated forward had taken Goh “by surprise”, and Goh “landed up leaning against the bonnet”. It is to be noted that the SOF recited that Goh “stood close to the front of (Jeyaseelan’s car) as he (Goh) intended to prevent (Jeyaseelan) from leaving.” I did not find this slight inconsistency in Goh’s evidence to be helpful to the Defence. The important fact was that Goh was clearly standing in front of Jeyaseelan’s car (which was stationary), whereupon Jeyaseelan decided to commit the rash act of accelerating forward.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goh said that there had been contact between Jeyaseelan’s car and himself. Goh felt “some pain on (his) left side of the body”, specifically the hips and knee. Goh described the impact as a “huge impact, else I wouldn’t have felt that immediate pain”.</a></p><a id="p1_17"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Jeyaseelan was driving off, Goh had “instantly”, “(taken) a few steps back and in the midst of doing so, (lost his) balance, lost (his) footwear and (he) sprained (his) ankle.” Goh sought medical attention the next day.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was referred to the medical report tendered as evidence, Goh said that his hips and knee were hurt at Jeyaseelan’s first action of accelerating “when the car hit me”. The ankle sprain occurred when Jeyaseelan drove forward the second time, causing Goh to lose his balance and sprain his ankle.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the DPP stated that Jeyaseelan’s assertion was that Jeyaseelan’s car did not hit Goh, Goh disagreed with Jeyaseelan’s assertion. The DPP further informed Goh that Jeyaseelan had alleged that Goh had hit the bonnet of Jeyaseelan’s car “a few times” and had kicked the left side of Jeyaseelan’s car near the front tyre. Goh again denied this further assertion ascribed to Jeyaseelan.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under cross-examination by the DC, Goh said he had alighted from his vehicle to “clarify” with Jeyaseelan, regarding Jeyaseelan’s swerving action causing Goh to have to execute an emergency brake.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the Defence’s stand that Jeyaseelan’s car had not hit Goh and that Goh’s injuries were caused when Goh had tried to stop Jeyaseelan driving away by using his (Goh’s) “left limb, hand and leg, to punch and kick the car”. Goh disagreed with this. The DC further put to Goh that Goh had walked in front of Jeyaseelan’s car to stop Jeyaseelan “from leaving the scene”. Goh disagreed. I repeat the observation made in [16].</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Jeyaseelan took the witness stand, he denied that Goh had been hit by his car. Jeyaseelan asserted that Goh had punched and kicked Jeyaseelan’s car. In evidence-in-chief, Jeyaseelan had even demonstrated how Goh had allegedly punched and kicked Jeyaseelan’s car. At this point, it is pertinent to note that when Goh was being cross-examined by the DC, the actual alleged acts of Goh as mechanically described by Jeyaseelan were not specifically put to Goh. This suggested that Jeyaseelan’s evidence as to the actual actions of Goh in allegedly punching and kicking Jeyaseelan’s car was an afterthought.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under cross-examination by the DPP, Jeyaseelan admitted that there had been “an exchange of vulgarities” between the two of them on the material date. Jeyaseelan further admitted that he was angry with Goh. Jeyaseelan agreed that Goh had been standing close to the front of Jeyaseelan’s car.</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing submissions, the DC maintained the Defence’s position that Jeyaseelan’s car did not hit Goh. Instead, it was Goh’s acts of punching and kicking Jeyaseelan’s car which constituted the contact between the car and Goh’s body. It was the Defence’s case that Goh had stood in front of Jeyaseelan’s car to prevent Jeyaseelan from driving off. Jeyaseelan had wanted to drive off, but Goh’s actions had initially prevented him from doing so. The Defence further asserted that Goh’s injuries were caused by Goh’s alleged acts of punching and kicking Jeyaseelan’s car.</a></p><a id="p1_25"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After carefully considering all the evidence (oral and documentary) presented at the Newton hearing and the respective closing submissions by the DC and the DPP, I found that the Prosecution had proven its case on the disputed portion of the SOF beyond a reasonable doubt. Goh had been hit by Jeyaseelan’s car when Jeyaseelan accelerated at the point that Goh was standing right in front of Jeyaseelan’s car. I gave a few brief oral remarks, <em>ex tempore</em>, before delivering the Verdict. The brief oral remarks were as follows (quoted <em>verbatim</em> from the transcribed Notes of Evidence).</a></p><a id="p1_26"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Start of oral remarks.) “Alright. I’m going to be giving a few brief oral remarks before delivering my decision for the Newton hearing. These oral remarks do not constitute all the grounds for my decision and may be elaborated upon or added to should the need arise.</a></p><a id="p1_27"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27"></a><a id="">If we look at paragraph 6 of the Statement of Facts, which apart from the disputed portion, has been admitted without qualification, I read the material portions:</a></p><a id=""> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">“When the traffic light at the junction turned green, the accused committed a rash act by accelerating his car and driving forward, thereby endangering the personal safety of the victim despite knowing that the victim was standing in front of the car” “in front of his car.”</p> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a><a id="">And then this is the sentence that is disputed:</a></p><a id=""> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">“When the accused accelerated his car forward, the accused’s car hit the victim.”</p> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a><a id="">First part of the sentence is not in dispute, “when the accused accelerated his car forward”. So, that has already been agreed in the previous sentence, so the disputed part really is whether the accused’s car hit the victim. Now, looking at the long statement of the accused, towards the end of the second paragraph:</a></p><a id=""> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">“I horned at him asking him to move aside. When my car started to inch, I slowly deviated and moved off. He also moved aside when my car started to inch forward. I affirm that I did not hit him, my car did not hit him.”</p> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a><a id="">I agree with the prosecution that his characterisation of inching forward was a slight exaggeration. The video showed that his acceleration was more than just a slow acceleration. It was quite fast in the circumstances and does support the rashness, which he had already pleaded guilty.</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a><a id="">Now, the next paragraph:</a></p><a id=""> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">“I also wish to add that the driver had hit my front car bonnet a few times and kicked the left side of the car near to the front tyre.”</p> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a><a id="">Now, the video evidence does not show this at all. Both video footage indicates that the victim had been at the front of the car at all times during that particular instance between the car and the victim. Of note as well, as the prosecution has pointed out, the medical report shows there had been a contusion to the pelvic area. Evidence of the accused does not explain in any way how the accused would sorry, how the victim would have sustained this particular injury. Now, we have the versions of the victim and the accused as to how this incident played out. The victim, being the one at the outside of the car, gives evidence that there had been contact between the car and hims and his body when the car accelerated forward. The accused was in the car itself, so there is that possibility that even if his acceleration had hit the victim, he may not have sensed that contact between the car and the victim. So, between the versions of the two, the victim would be in a better position to be able to say that there had been contact between the car and his body when the car accelerated forward. Having heard the version of the defendant, of how the victim punched and kicked the car, as I said, there is it does not support the theory that the prosecution has put forward as to how a pelvic injury had been caused.</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a><a id="">Considering all the evidence as a whole, the evidence of the victim is to be preferred and I find that the prosecution has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. My finding, therefore, is that the disputed portion of paragraph 6 of the Statement of Facts, which is “When the accused accelerated his car forward, the accused’s car hit the victim” has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Now, I just pause to state that the words are “the accused’s car hit the victim” and it stops there. It does not necessarily suggest that it was an intentional action on the part of the accused. However, the Court will have to take into account what has been agreed, which was that sorry, what had been admitted, which was that the accused had committed a rash act by accelerating his car and driving forward, endangering the personal safety of the victim despite knowing that the victim was standing in front of the car. So, having proven this point beyond a reasonable doubt, I therefore find the accused guilty of the proceeded charge based on his plea of guilt, his admission without qualification to the Statement of Facts, save for the disputed portion of paragraph 6 and this finding that the disputed portion has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt and convict him accordingly. He has admitted and consented to the other charge being taken into consideration for purpose of sentence.” (End of oral remarks.)</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was satisfied that Goh was a truthful witness. I had the opportunity of observing both Goh and Jeyaseelan and their respective demeanour on the witness stand. Whilst there may have been slight inconsistencies in Goh’s evidence, I found that his evidence, that Jeyaseelan’s car had hit him, was convincing. I accepted Goh’s explanation as to why he had been able to apparently “walk away” from the collision, and why he had not boarded the ambulance that had been situated nearby. I accepted Goh’s evidence that he had been in pain after Jeyaseelan’s car had hit him. The video evidence supported the version given by Goh, and did not support Jeyaseelan’s version.</a></p><a id="p1_28"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The admitted medical evidence also supported the Prosecution’s case and corroborated Goh’s testimony. The injuries noted by the doctor were in line with the version of the events put forth by Goh. That the injuries were to Goh’s pelvis, knee and ankle was consonant with the version put forward by Goh as to how he had sustained these injuries. Jeyaseelan’s version could not explain how Goh’s pelvis came to be injured. The case theory of the Defence as to how the knee injury was caused also appeared to be contrived.</a></p><a id="p1_29"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a consideration of the video evidence, the medical evidence as well as Goh’s oral testimony, I found that there was no reasonable doubt shown by the Defence and that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Jeyaseelan’s evidence did not raise any reasonable doubt in my mind.</a></p><a id="p1_30"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeyaseelan was traced, but not for convictions concerning violence-related offences or for offences involving rashness on his part. As for mitigation presented by the Defence, I carefully considered this but came to the conclusion that the factors cited by the Defence were not sufficient to materially affect what would be an appropriate sentence given the circumstances of the case.</a></p><a id="p1_31"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution sought the sentence that was ultimately meted out to Jeyaseelan. The Prosecution asserted that this was a case of road rage. The main plank of the Defence submission was that this was not a case of road rage, and therefore a fine would suffice as punishment.</a></p><a id="p1_32"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence sought to show that it was not a case of road rage as the parties had disengaged after their earlier dispute over the shared use of the road. According to the Defence, there was no continuation of the road-related dispute.</a></p><a id="p1_33"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During submissions on sentence, the DC conceded that if the Court found that the present case was indeed one of road rage, “then it obviously has crossed the custodial threshold”. The Defence submitted that even if the Court found that this was a case of road rage, (and again agreeing that in such a case, “obviously, it crossed the custodial threshold”) an imprisonment term of one week plus a fine of $2,500 would be “more than sufficient”. The Defence did not make any substantive submission regarding an Order for Disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving licence. The Defence left this issue to the Court to decide.</a></p><a id="p1_34"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After carefully considering the submissions on sentence by the Prosecution and the Defence, I decided that the sentence sought by the Prosecution was appropriate. The actions of Jeyaseelan were highly aggravating in the circumstances. Before I sentenced Jeyaseelan, I made the following brief oral comments, <em>ex tempore</em> (quoted verbatim from the transcribed Notes of Evidence).</a></p><a id="p1_35"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Start of oral comments.) “I’ll just make a few brief oral comments before sentencing. As stated earlier in my remarks to defence counsel, in this case, it would be artificial to state that this was not a road rage case simply because the accused had entered his car, putting an end to the dispute. The dispute was still ongoing in the circumstances when the victim went to the front of the accused’s car. Quite clearly from the point of view of the victim, the dispute had not been resolved yet. And in his mind, whether rightly or wrongly, there were still issues to be discussed or resolved between the two. What, of course, we have to consider in this particular case is the rash action of the accused in accelerating the car forward with the victim standing right in front of the car. Again, it is quite clear that a situation like this where as I have said, would clearly be an event arising out of a road rage incident. In such circumstances, the principle of general deterrence would very clearly come to the fore. A strong message must be sent that any dispute or disagreement must not be settled in this way - in this particular case, by the accused driving off in this dangerous fashion. Had the victim not stood in front of the car, of course, it’s a different issue altogether if the accused had just safely driven off. But as I said, the general deterrence principle in this particular case looms very large, that any disagreements on the road, if they cannot be settled between the two parties amicably, must obviously wait for the intervention of a third party - very often in cases like this, by authorities such as the police. In no such circumstances is any party to act in such a way as to create danger. Whilst the defence suggests perhaps that it was the victim that put himself in the dangerous position, it must be made clear that when he did this, the car was still stationary and it was the accused’s act of moving the car forward, which created the actual danger that we saw in this case. I agree with the prosecution that some assistance as to sentencing can be derived from the cited case of Raymond Yap, where the sentence had been affirmed by the High Court as stated by the prosecution. In this particular case, a strong message must be sent. Again, as I stressed that actions such as those committed by the accused are simply not to be tolerated and have to be met with a sufficiently harsh punishment in order to deter all other road users from so acting.</a></p><a id="p1_36"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="">Mr Jeyaseelan, please stand. You are convicted on one charge, one other charge being taken into consideration. For the proceeded charge in MAC 903639 of 2021, you are sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 4 weeks, disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 6 months with effect from date of release.” (End of oral comments.)</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in my oral comments, it would be artificial to treat what had occurred in this case as an “interruption” or “termination” of the road rage circumstances surrounding the dispute between Jeyaseelan and Goh. Quite clearly, the dispute was still continuing as Goh was intending to have the police intervene. Even if we were to accept the Defence’s theory that Goh was trying to prevent Jeyaseelan from leaving the scene (as confirmed in the SOF), this in itself emphasised that the road use-related dispute had not ceased.</a></p><a id="p1_37"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeyaseelan went on to commit the rash act in order to extricate himself from the scene and consequently the dispute itself. That he chose to do so in the manner as played out was highly aggravating in the circumstances. A motor car, it has been recognised, especially in the hands of a rash driver, is a potentially lethal weapon. The need for a sentence that met the demand for general deterrence was clear to be seen, in this case.</a></p><a id="p1_38"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My finding after the Newton hearing was that Jeyaseelan’s car had hit Goh. There was insufficient evidence to suggest that Jeyaseelan’s act (which caused Goh to suffer hurt) was intentional. But it had to be borne in mind that Jeyaseelan admitted that he had committed a rash act in accelerating forward as he did. Actual harm was caused in that Goh was hurt in the process. If the evidence had indicated that Jeyaseelan had acted intentionally to hurt Goh (as opposed to having caused the hurt as a result of a rash act), a sentence well in excess of the four weeks’ imprisonment that was meted out, would have been warranted. This was clearly a case involving road rage. Whereas in many cases involving road rage, where offenders are charged for having caused hurt by employing physical bodily means, here, Jeyaseelan had used his car to create the harm that ensued. The sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate in all the circumstances of the case. A period of disqualification from holding or obtaining driving licences for all classes of vehicles was also necessary in this case; a six-month period was considered appropriate and I so ordered. Jeyaseelan had to reflect on his actions, and the public was entitled to the protection that the DQ Order would grant.</a></p><a id="p1_39"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a><a id="p1_40">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, what could not be ignored was the level of culpability demonstrated by Jeyaseelan. Quite clearly, whoever was in the right for the earlier issue surrounding the shared use of the road, appeared to have been unresolved. Goh decided that the intervention of the police was necessary. It has to be stressed that when Goh positioned himself in front of Jeyaseelan’s car, Jeyaseelan’s car was stationary. It was Jeyaseelan who decided to move his car in a rash fashion. He caused his car to be a potentially lethal weapon. As a result, hurt was caused to Goh.</a></p><a id="p1_40"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a><a id="p1_41">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actions of Jeyaseelan cannot be condoned and must be condemned. Like-minded motorists must be deterred from acting in similar fashion. The sentence passed in this case (an imprisonment term of four weeks and the DQ Order of six months), was in the final analysis, appropriate punishment to be meted out. A sentence of one week’s imprisonment plus a fine (the alternative submission of the Defence) was simply inadequate in the circumstances.</a></p><a id="p1_41"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a><a id="p1_42">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeyaseelan is currently on bail pending appeal. The imprisonment sentence and the DQ Order have been stayed.</a></p><a id="p1_42"> </a></div></content></html>
