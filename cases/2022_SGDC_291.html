He understood the nature and consequences of his plea. The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification. He also admitted and consented to three similar charges to be TIC. After having heard the Prosecution’s Skeletal Sentencing Submissions (“PSSS”) and the Defence’s Plea in Mitigation (“PIM”), I adjourned the matter to 12 September 2022 for sentencing. It should be noted that all the five charges were classified as Magistrate’s Court Notices (“MCN”) at this stage;</a></p><a id="p1_3-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_3-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 12 September 2022. the accused was sentenced to a global sentence of three months’ and two weeks’ imprisonment. The accused was allowed to defer his sentence until 27 September 2022 and his bail was extended accordingly. After the accused had left the courtroom, it came to my attention that, as the accused was subject to enhanced punishment under s 35 of the CLTPA, he was now liable to be punished to a term of imprisonment of up to six years. Accordingly, this brought the matter beyond the jurisdiction a Magistrate to try.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later on the same day, I saw the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor (“DPP”) and Defence Counsel parties <em>via</em> Zoom. We were unable to contact the accused. The Defence had no objection to the charge being amended from an MCN charge to a District Court Notice (“DCN”) charge. Unfortunately, as the accused had already been convicted for the offences on 26 August 2022, the DPP was unable refile any amended charge in the Integrated Criminal Management System (“ICMS”). Both parties agreed that that therefore, the court should record a retraction of the accused’s guilty plea to allow the charges to be amended from MCN to DCN charges. On 27 September 2022, the date of the accused’s scheduled surrender, the court will then re-enter the accused’s guilty plea. As such, at the present time, a retraction of the accused’s guilty plea was accordingly recorded in ICMS;</a></p><a id="p1_3-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_3-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 27 September 2022, the case was re-mentioned with the charges having been amended from MCN to DCN.

After reconfirming the Prosecution’s sentencing position and the Defence’s plea in mitigation and sentencing submission, I proceeded to sentence the accused to a global sentence of three months’ and two weeks’ imprisonment.

With regard to the TIC charges, I had already considered the TIC charges when determining the uplift for the VCH offence against V1, I was therefore of the view that I should not consider that factor here as this would be double counting the TIC charges as an aggravating factor.</a></p><a id="p1_60"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a><a id="p1_61">61&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I considered that only a marginal uplift would be appropriate.

This meant that the maximum imprisonment term prescribed by law for an offence of VCH is doubled from three to six years.</a></p><a id="p1_63"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a><a id="p1_64">64&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the VCH offence against V1, the Prosecution submitted that an uplift of one months’ imprisonment would be appropriate while the Defence submitted that there be no uplift.</a></p><a id="p1_64"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a><a id="p1_65">65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I disagreed with the Defence. The fact that Parliament saw fit to double the punishment prescribed by law for offenders who committed offences of violence while on PSO clearly showed that such offences should be more severely dealt with.

The offences that attract the enhanced punishment under s 35 of the CLTPA are offences of violence. In comparison to the other offences in the Third Schedule, the offence of VCH is not one of the more serious offences envisaged;</a></p><a id="p1_66-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_66-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>When the offence was committed</u>. The PSO was issued to the accused on 9 May 2019. The order was for a duration of three years. He would have been reminded of this on 30 December 2019, when the PSO was varied and changes to the restrictions were imposed. Less than a year into the PSO, and less than four months after the PSO was varied, the accused breached one of the conditions of his PSO by committing this offence.</a></p><a id="p1_66-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_67">67&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore adjudged that the proposed uplift of one months’ imprisonment by the Prosecution for the VCH offence against V1 was fair and appropriate in the circumstances.

The indicative sentence at this stage is 15 weeks’ imprisonment, being the total of the three stages described above, namely, seven weeks (1<sup>st</sup> stage – step one of <em>Low Song Chye</em>), four weeks’ (2<sup>nd</sup> stage – step two of <em>Low Song Chye</em>) and four weeks’ (3<sup>rd</sup> stage – uplift for enhanced punishment);</a></p><a id="p1_67-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_67-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The VCH offence against V2</u>. I Adjudged that the uplift for this offence would be similar to that against V1, in percentage terms.
