8.19pm is inconsistent with the objective evidence of the call records. Despite his claim that “Ah Kow” called him at about 8.16pm – 8.17pm (<em>ie</em>, two to three minutes before 8.19pm), the call records<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a> show that the latest incoming call to Tham’s mobile phone before 8.19pm was a call from the Accused at 8.17pm.

However, on cross-examination by the Accused’s Counsel, Tham changed his account and claimed instead that during the call, “Ah Kow” told him the price of the drugs (<em>ie</em>, S$3,200) and that <em>someone would call him</em> and Tham should then go downstairs to collect it.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a> Subsequently, before Tham headed downstairs, it was not “Ah Kow” but someone else whom Tham did not know who called Tham and asked him to go downstairs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51">51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agreed with the Prosecution that the alleged account of the conversation with “Ah Kow” was a fabrication.

Secondly, all the numbers that contacted Tham between 7.42pm and 8.17pm were saved under a contact name in Tham’s mobile phone. This objective evidence refuted Tham’s claim that someone whom he did not know subsequently called him to ask him to go downstairs. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_109" id="Ftn_109_1"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52">52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tham claimed at trial that he went to the slip road to meet “Anneh” before going to the Carpark to meet the Accused.

Adding up the time that Tham claimed he took (a) to walk from the lift lobby to the slip road to meet “Anneh”; (b) to meet “Anneh” to collect the drugs; (c) to walk from the slip road to the Car at the Carpark; (d) to meet the Accused in the Car; and (e) to walk from the Car back to the lift lobby, the total duration would add up to be more than two minutes.

Insp Eng’s evidence that (a) Tham was empty-handed before the meeting with the Accused; and (b) Tham was seen carrying something after the meeting. Insp Eng stood firm by his evidence under cross-examination by the Accused’s Counsel and there is no reason for this Court to doubt Insp Eng’s credibility. In contrast, Tham’s attempt to assist the case for the Defence at the trial is riddled with inconsistencies. Tham could not stick to a consistent account at trial. When Tham was recalled before the close of the Prosecution’s case, Tham suddenly made an about-turn and claimed that he in fact removed one black resealable plastic bag from the Car.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_114" id="Ftn_114_1"><sup>[note: 114]</sup></a> That was the first time Tham mentioned any black plastic bags, having failed to make any mention of this in his statements and in court in his earlier evidence.

For instance, what Tham stated at [27] of “<b>P34</b>” (<em>ie</em>, that the Accused called him at about 4pm to 5pm on 3 September 2019) is consistent with the call records.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_115" id="Ftn_115_1"><sup>[note: 115]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57">57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Tham provided two reasons for allegedly falsely implicating the Accused,<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_116" id="Ftn_116_1"><sup>[note: 116]</sup></a> which lack credibility.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58">58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, Tham claimed that he was angry at the Accused for pressing him for repayment of the money that he had borrowed,<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_117" id="Ftn_117_1"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a> despite initially telling him to take his time with the repayment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_118" id="Ftn_118_1"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span> As such, Tham falsely implicated the Accused as being the one who delivered the diamorphine to him. This explanation is unsubstantiated for the following reasons:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of investigations, Tham gave several long statements, including (i) a statement on 9 September 2019 which was admitted by the Defence as “<b>D4</b>” and “<b>D7</b>”; (ii) a statement on 10 September 2019 which was admitted by the Defence as “<b>D8</b>”; (iii) a statement on 5 November 2019 which was admitted by the Defence as “<b>D5</b>”; (iv) a statement on 23&nbsp;December 2019 which was admitted by the Prosecution as “<b>P34</b>” and by the Defence as “<b>D6</b>” and “<b>D9</b>”; and (v) a statement on 10 March 2022 which was admitted by the Prosecution as “<b>P35</b>” and “<b>P36</b>”. In the first two statements given by Tham on 9 and 10&nbsp;September 2019, Tham, on his own admission,<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_119" id="Ftn_119_1"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a> made up an imaginary figure whom he named “Ah Tuck” and claimed that it was “Ah Tuck” who delivered the diamorphine to him. I accept the Prosecution’s contention that if Tham was indeed angry at the Accused for chasing him for repayment, there was no reason for Tham to come up with an imaginary figure instead of falsely incriminating the Accused right from the outset. Tham was unable to offer any explanation as to why he would allegedly let his anger get the better of him and lead him to falsely implicate the Accused only in the third statement recorded on 23 December 2019, more than three months after his arrest.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to Tham’s claim that it was “convenient” for him to falsely pin the blame on the Accused, what Tham did was the exact opposite.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_120" id="Ftn_120_1"><sup>[note: 120]</sup></a> Instead of blaming the Accused for <em>both</em> the diamorphine and the ‘ice’ found in Ah Poh’s house, Tham was selective in his incrimination, choosing to implicate the Accused only for the diamorphine but not the ‘ice’ in “<b>P36</b>”, the statement that Tham gave on 10 March 2022, more than six months after his arrest. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_121" id="Ftn_121_1"><sup>[note: 121]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59">59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Tham claimed that he falsely implicated the Accused in “<b>P34</b>” because he had taken diamorphine and ‘ice’ at that time and was not able to think straight. However, the evidence clearly show that when Tham gave his first two statements on 9 and 10 September 2019, Tham was clear-headed enough to admit his own drug activities,<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_122" id="Ftn_122_1"><sup>[note: 122]</sup></a> to state the truth about the $1,000 that he had borrowed from the Accused,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_123" id="Ftn_123_1"><sup>[note: 123]</sup></a></span> and also to identify the phone that the Accused used to contact him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_124" id="Ftn_124_1"><sup>[note: 124]</sup></a></span> He was also clear-headed enough to request that amendments be made to his statements.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_125" id="Ftn_125_1"><sup>[note: 125]</sup></a></span> According to IO Hazel, Tham was sent for a drug withdrawal assessment prior to 9 September 2019 and he was found not to be suffering from any drug withdrawal symptoms.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_126" id="Ftn_126_1"><sup>[note: 126]</sup></a></span> By the time “<b>P34</b>” was recorded from Tham on 23 December 2019 (<em>ie</em>, three months later), there is no reasonable basis to believe that Tham was under any influence of drugs.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60">60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Prosecution’s submission that Tham never hesitated in admitting to his own drug activities<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_127" id="Ftn_127_1"><sup>[note: 127]</sup></a> in his statements.

After identifying the indicative starting range based on the weight of the drugs trafficked, the next step is for this Court to decide whether to adjust the indicative starting sentence upward or downward based on the offender’s culpability and the presence of aggravating and mitigating factors (<em>Suventher Shanmugam v PP </em></a><em><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20605-SSP.xml')">[2017] 2 SLR 115</a></em> at [29] and [30]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75">75&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pertinent to point out in this case that the Defence did not contend that the parity principle was offended, as Tham, the buyer of the drugs, had pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of trafficking in not less than 9.99g of diamorphine, at the exercise of the prosecutorial discretion against Tham.</a></p><a id="p1_75"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a><a id="p1_76">76&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as Accused’s culpability on the trafficking charge is concerned, I accept that it falls within the lower category as there is no evidence to suggest that Accused performed a directing role and/or recruited others in the operation.

I also note that Accused had claimed trial to the trafficking charge and was not entitled to discount on the sentence if he had pleaded guilty.
