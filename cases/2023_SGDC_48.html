There was high potential harm as can be seen from the footage as there were pedestrians seen standing at the junction. In respect of the harm, it was further submitted that it fell under moderate as it involved both property and personal injury. Although the second victim sustained minor injuries, there were a total of three vehicles involved and the total amount of damage was more than $28,000.

Driving is an inherently dangerous activity that could pose a serious risk as motor vehicles can cause a devastating effect especially in the hands of unlicenced drivers. This leaves the public in danger because of their incompetence and failure to comply with traffic rules.</a></p><a id="p1_30"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was submitted that in the recent High Court case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Rizuwan Bin Rohmat</em> (Magistrate’s Appeal No 9176 of 2021)(“<em>Rizuwan</em>”), Kannan Ramesh JAD in his oral judgment had set out a benchmark sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment for unqualified drivers who drive without a valid driving licence under s 35(1) of the RTA.

As a result of her driving, an accident occurred which resulted in both property damage and personal injury. The accused admitted that due to insufficient rest she was tired at the time of driving. This would add on to her culpability as a driver require full concentration to prevent harm to other road users.

It was submitted that the accused’s culpability was low. At the material time, she had momentarily lost control of the motorcar, mounted the left kerb and collided onto a tree before it veered to the right to collide onto the first victim and onto the second victim. This caused the second victim’s vehicle to move backwards and collide into the third victim.

He was given outpatient treatment with 4 days of outpatient sick leave. The Court was urged to consider her the accused’s early plea of guilt, which is indicative of her genuine remorse.

The Defence submitted that the custodial threshold is not crossed in the present case and respectfully disagrees that the starting point for offences under s 35(1) of the RTA is necessarily a custodial sentence. It was submitted ss 35(1) and 43(4) of the RTA are distinguishable and the starting point for these sections should not be the same.</a></p><a id="p1_43"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a><a id="p1_44">44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offence of driving without a valid driving licence was previously punishable with a fine not exceeding $1,000, or with imprisonment for up to 3 months, or both. Under the amendments to the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 2019, the punishment provision of s 35(3) of the RTA was enhanced to a fine of up to $10,000 and/or imprisonment of up to three years which is the same maximum punishment as the offence of driving whilst under disqualification under s 43 of the RTA, punishable under s 43(4) of the RTA. While it was acknowledged that the maximum penalties under ss 35(1) and 43(4) of the RTA are now the same, it was the Defence’s position that the sentencing tariffs under s 43(4) of the RTA ought not to be imported into s 35(1) of the RTA as the offences are distinguishable.</a></p><a id="p1_44"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a><a id="p1_45">45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the Defence’s position that s 43(1) of the RTA deals with additional considerations and is a more serious offence than s 35(1) of the RTA. It was submitted that more than just the danger posed to the public, it is clear having a custodial term as the starting point is aimed to signal the gravity of blatantly ignoring a court order. It was further submitted that it took into account the fact that an offender under s 43 of the RTA is invariably a second-time offender, thereby intuitively making said offender more culpable. It was emphasised that the offence of driving under a disqualification order deal with the added culpability of the offender, in that he had completely disregarded the law and authority of the courts and would be a repeat offender.

Such an argument is clearly untenable as by reason of the doctrine of stare decisis, I was bound by the sentencing benchmark set by the High Court for unqualified drivers. Guided by the High Court’s decision in <em>Rizuwan</em>, I had considered the following factors as set out at [50] in calibrating the exact sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_56"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Reasons for driving </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a><a id="p1_57">57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused had driven her husband’s motor car to Pasir Ris Sports Hall market to buy some food for her family and was involved in the accident as she was driving home. According to the Defence, she had done so in order not to disturb her husband who was praying in his room. This was clearly not a good reason for her to drive as she had never passed the requisite test of competence to drive prescribed under the RTA and thus did not have a valid driving licence. Instead of driving her husband’s car to get food for the family, she should have used public transport or booked a taxi or a private hire car to get to the Pasir Ris Sports Hall market as well as to return home.</a></p><a id="p1_57"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a><a id="p1_58">58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be a qualified driver, an individual in Singapore would to have pass the Basic Theory Test (BTT), the Final Theory Test (FTT) as well as the practical driving test before being issued with a driving licence of a particular class of vehicle. Accordingly, as an unqualified driver the accused would not have been familiar or is aware of the various traffic rules, traffic signs and on general road safety which a learner driver is tested on during the BTT, FTT and the practical driving test. Furthermore, the accused would have never been tested on her driving skills on the driving circuit, her ability to interact safely with other road users and her ability to comply with the road traffic rules while on the road.</a></p><a id="p1_58"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a><a id="p1_59">59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As observed by See Kee Oon J in <em>Public Prosecutor v Koh Thiam Huat</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20892-SSP.xml')">[2017] 4 SLR 1099</a> at [41] (“<em>Koh Thiam Huat</em>”), driving is an inherently dangerous activity that can pose serious risk to road users and pedestrians alike. Hence, I agreed with the Prosecution’s position that driving is an inherently dangerous activity that could pose a serious risk as motor vehicles can cause a devastating effect especially in the hands of unlicenced drivers. This leaves the public in danger because of their incompetence and failure to comply with traffic rules.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Manner of driving </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60">60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, she was clearly unfit to drive as she had driven in a dangerous manner. She flouted a traffic rule when she failed to conform to the traffic red light signal as she negotiated a left turn into Pasir Ris Drive 6 towards Pasir Ris Close. Shortly after, she mounted the left kerb, collided onto a tree and continued to veer to the right and collided onto the first victim’s motor van and then onto the second victim’s motorcar. The impact caused the second victim’s motorcar to move backwards and collided onto the third victim’s motorcar. All three vehicles were stationary along the opposite direction due to red light signal and hurt was caused to the second victim.</a></p><a id="p1_60"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a><a id="p1_61">61&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the accused admitted that she did not have enough sleep on the day of accident. She had slept late as she was working and had only a few hours of sleep. I disagreed with the Defence’s position that the accused being tired at the time of driving was not linked to her offending conduct as it can be reasonable inferred her ability to concentrate would have been compromised due to inadequate rest.</a></p><a id="p1_61"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Consequence arising from the accused’s driving</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a><a id="p1_62">62&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused caused serious property damage amounting to more than $28,000 to the three vehicles in addition to the damage caused to her husband’s car. I considered the fact that restitution was made to one of the drivers and the damage caused to the two other vehicles were settled via insurance claims. She also caused personal injury to the second victim as he suffered a minor head injury and neck contusion. He was hospitalised for overnight and discharged with 4 days of medical leave.</a></p><a id="p1_62"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conduct after the offence </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a><a id="p1_63">63&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had considered her the accused’s early plea of guilt which is indicative of her remorse.

All things considered, applying the benchmark sentence in <em>Rizuwan</em> and calibrating it with the above factors, an uplift from the benchmark sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment was warranted. In my view a sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment was just and appropriate in the circumstances as it combines the sentencing objectives of punishment, protection of the public and deterrence.</a></p><a id="p1_64"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a><a id="p1_65">65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining the appropriate length of the disqualification order, I was guided by High Court’s approach in <em>Kwan</em>. I was mindful that Aedit Abdullah J in <em>Kwan</em> had observed the imposition of disqualification takes effect above and beyond the primary sentence of an imprisonment term or fine, and a sufficiently lengthy disqualification order reminds an offender every day of his offence and that he is not permitted to drive because of his bad behaviour. It was disqualification rather than a fine that a motorist fears most: at [59] to [62].</a></p><a id="p1_65"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a><a id="p1_66">66&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Kwan</em> at [65] to [71], essentially the relevant and material factors when determining the period of disqualification are:</a></p><a id="p1_66"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66"></a><a id="p1_66-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circumstances of the commission of the offence and</a></p><a id="p1_66-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_66-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued ability to drive and attitude towards other road users.</a></p><a id="p1_66-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_67">67&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, it was undisputed that a disqualification order was warranted in respect of the charges. What was in issue was the appropriate length. The Prosecution had sought a disqualification period of between two to three years while the Defence had sought for a period 18 months. In my view, a disqualification of three years was warranted and of sufficient length to remind the accused that due to her lack of driving experience, she had caused an accident which resulted in substantial property damage to three vehicles as well as personal injury to the second victim.</a></p><a id="p1_67"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">S 64(1) punishable under s 64(2B)(a) RTA</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a><a id="p1_68">68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my consideration of the appropriate sentence to be imposed for the dangerous driving charge, I was guided by the High Court in <em>Koh Thiam Huat</em> at [41] where it was held:</a></p><a id="p1_68"> </a><p class="Judg-Quote-1"><a id="p1_68">41 As I noted in <em>Lim Ying Ying Luciana v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19417-SSP.xml')">[2016] 4 SLR 1220</a> (at [28]), the two principal parameters which a sentencing court would generally have regard to in evaluating the seriousness of a crime are: (a) the <em>harm</em> caused by the offence; and (b) the accused’s <em>culpability</em>. “Harm” is a measure of the injury which has been caused to society by the commission of the offence, whereas “culpability” is a measure of the degree of relative blameworthiness disclosed by an offender’s actions and is measured chiefly in relation to the extent and manner of the offender’s involvement in the criminal act. In the context of the offence of dangerous driving under s 64(1) of the RTA, the primary factor relating to the <em>harm</em> caused would be the extent of injury or damage caused. A related and equally important consideration would be the <em>potential</em> harm that might have resulted, given that driving is an inherently dangerous activity that can pose serious risk to road users and pedestrians alike. The factors increasing the accused’s <em>culpability</em> would include a particularly dangerous manner of driving. As illustrations, the aggravating factors identified in <em>Hue An Li</em>, <em>ie</em>, speeding, drink-driving and sleepy driving, would clearly contribute to this, as would driving while using a mobile phone. In addition, if the dangerous driving was deliberate (for instance, in “hell riding” cases), this would also indicate a higher level of culpability. Aside from these two principal parameters, the court should also have regard to other mitigating and aggravating factors which do not directly relate to the commission of the offence <em>per se</em>. These include (but are not limited to) an accused’s good or bad driving record, as well as his remorse or lack thereof.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69">69&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this was a dangerous driving case decided prior to the passing of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 2019 (Act&nbsp;19 of 2019) and the prescribed penalties are now each tiered according to the degree of hurt caused as well as for cases of non-personal injury or potential harm, in my view the sentencing principles remain relevant.</a></p><a id="p1_69"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a><a id="p1_70">70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining the appropriate sentence, I should have regard to two principal parameters in evaluating the seriousness namely the harm caused by the offence and the accused’s culpability.</a></p><a id="p1_70"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Culpability</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a><a id="p1_71">71&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the dangerous driving charge, I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused’s culpability was at the lower end of moderate having regard to the accused’s poor manner of driving. The accused had driven without a licence, failed to comply with a traffic red light signal when she negotiated a left turn, mounted a kerb and collided onto a tree. In a state of panic, she caused the car to veer to the right, cutting across two lanes, mounted across the centre divider and collided onto the two vehicles in the opposite direction. In addition, she had driven the vehicle in blatant disregard of the road traffic rules.</a></p><a id="p1_71"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a><a id="p1_72">72&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also a culpability-enhancing factor that the accused had driven when she did not have enough sleep on the day of accident. She had slept late as she was working and had only a few hours of sleep. It could be inferred that under such circumstances, she had driven the car when her ability to concentrate on the road was compromised by her lack of rest.</a></p><a id="p1_72"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Harm</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a><a id="p1_73">73&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of harm, I considered that both personal injury (although minor) and substantial property damage amounting to more than $28,000 was caused to three vehicles. There was also high potential harm to other road users as pedestrians as well as cyclists could be seen waiting to use the pedestrian crossing at the junction as she made the left turn from the accused’s in-car camera footage. In addition, it was evident from the footage that the traffic flow in the vicinity of the junction was moderate. Hence, the accused’s bad driving had posed a serious risk to other road users.</a></p><a id="p1_73"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a><a id="p1_74">74&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, in respect of the harm, I agreed with the Prosecution that it fell under the moderate category as it involved both property damage and personal injury. Nevertheless, the harm caused was ameliorated by the fact that the accused had made restitution to one of the drivers and the damage caused to the two other vehicles were settled via insurance claims. The accused was a first offender who had shown her remorse by pleaded guilty. She had been forthcoming and co-operated with investigations.</a></p><a id="p1_74"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a><a id="p1_75">75&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution has sought for $2,500 fine and a 24 months’ disqualification. The Defence had submitted for $2,000 fine and 12 months’ disqualification and relied on the cases of <em>Lee Kuan Yee</em> and <em>Mills</em>. It was also the Defence’s position that the present case fell within the lowest end of cases involving hurt.</a></p><a id="p1_75"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a><a id="p1_76">76&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was of the view that the case of <em>Lee Kuan Yee</em> where a fine of $7,500 and disqualification of 18 months was imposed can be distinguished from the present case although it also involved the offender who had beat the red light. I noted that the victim suffered a closed comminuted fracture of his right distal radius and was given 7 days of medical leave. The offender had compounded two speeding offences. In comparison, the victim in the present case suffered less serious injury <em>ie</em> minor head injury and neck contusion, he was hospitalised for 1 day and was given 4 days of medical leave. The accused is also a first offender.</a></p><a id="p1_76"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a><a id="p1_77">77&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of <em>Mills</em> similarly involved an offender who had beat the red light. In that case a fine of $3,000 and disqualification of 11 months was imposed. In that case, the first victim suffered a right shoulder and chest wall contusion while the second victim, the offender’s 5-year-old son suffered pain in his left cheek. The offender had a clean driving record. The case of <em>Mills</em> can be distinguished from the present case in view of the higher degree of harm and culpability in the present case.</a></p><a id="p1_77"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a><a id="p1_78">78&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, I agreed with both the Prosecution and the Defence that the custodial threshold had not been crossed. Nevertheless, I was of the view that a higher fine than that proposed by both the Prosecution and the Defence was warranted. Unlike the offenders in the two cases cited by the Defence, the accused was an unqualified driver who had driven in a dangerous manner and had caused substantial property damage as well as slight injury to the second victim. All things considered, I was of the view that a fine of $4,500 was just and appropriate in the circumstances as it combines the sentencing objectives of punishment, protection of the public and deterrence.</a></p><a id="p1_78"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a><a id="p1_79">79&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, it was undisputed that a disqualification order was warranted in respect of the charges. What was in issue was the appropriate length. The Prosecution had sought a disqualification period of between twenty-four months while the Defence had sought for a period 12 months. I agreed with the Prosecution that a disqualification of 24 months or 2 years was warranted and of sufficient length to remind the accused that her poor manner of driving due to her lack of driving experience had caused an accident which resulted in substantial property damage to three vehicles as well as personal injury to the second victim.</a></p><a id="p1_79"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">S 3(1) of the MVA </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a><a id="p1_80">80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The usual sentence for an offence under s 3(1) of the MVA for a first offender is usually a fine ranging from $600 to $800 and the mandatory disqualification for a period of 12 months from the date of the conviction or to a longer period of disqualification unless there are special reasons not to make the order. In addition, a charge of taking and driving away a motorcar without the owner’s consent under s 96(1) of the RTA was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_80"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a><a id="p1_81">81&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of “special reasons” was considered by the High Court in the cases of <em>Muhammad Faizal bin Rahim v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/13294-SSP-M.xml')">[2012] 1 SLR 116</a> and <em>Prathib s/o M Balan v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21700-SSP.xml')">[2018] 3 SLR 1066</a>.

In the present case, as the accused was a first offender who had pleaded guilty to the charge and a charge under s 96(1) of the RTA was taken into consideration, I was of the view that the higher fine of $800 and disqualification order of 12 months from the date of conviction was just and appropriate in the circumstances. It was undisputed that the disqualification period of 12 months from the date of conviction was warranted and that no special reasons that were connected to the offence were provided by the Defence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Global sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83">83&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The global sentence in respect of the three proceeded charges in <em>DAC-914256-2022</em> to <em>DAC-914258-2022</em> was therefore six weeks’ imprisonment, a fine of $4,800 in default 17 days’ imprisonment and three years disqualification as the three disqualification periods ran concurrently.</a></p><a id="p1_83"> </a></div></content></html>
