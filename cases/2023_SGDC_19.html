From the video of the attack that was played in court, it could be seen that the multiple blows struck on the victim were closely visible to the accused who was holding the victim down in a chokehold. There is nothing to suggest that the accused was merely a passive or reluctant participant in the attack on the victim or that the accused felt any concern upon seeing the blows suffered and the injuries sustained by the victim. The role of the accused in holding the victim to the ground in a chokehold was critical in enabling the grievous hurt that was caused to the victim.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51">51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to the argument raised in the mitigation that the accused was influenced by others older than him, I would point out that the accused was above 21 years old at the time he committed the offence. He had already completed his national service in the Singapore Civil Defence Force as a section commander. In the mitigation plea, it is stated that “At the time of the offence, he was running his own hair salon.”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a> It did not appear that the accused was so young and immature, that it should significantly reduce his culpability for the attack on the victim.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52">52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, it is important to highlight that the protracted attack on the victim was enabled by the accused holding the victim in a chokehold, causing the victim to be defenceless. This was not a case of a young offender acting out of impulse or momentary loss of self-control. The accused held the victim in a chokehold on the ground for at least 23 minutes,<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a> and would have close sight of the repeated kicks and punches inflicted upon the victim. Despite this, the accused continued to hold the victim in a chokehold, notwithstanding the victim repeatedly pleading that he could not breathe. As the accused played a crucial role in the brutal, savage and prolonged attack on the victim, any mitigating value from the age of the accused would be minimal.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53">53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mitigation plea states that the accused cooperated fully during investigations, apologises to the victim, and submits that this is a sign of his remorse.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a> The prosecution submits that unlike GEH, the accused did not offer compensation and instead re-offended while court proceedings for this offence was ongoing.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> In relation to the absence of an offer of compensation, counsel for the accused explained that no offer was made as the victim had already turned down an offer of compensation from GEH.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54">54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that what is critical in weighing any remorse of the accused, is the offence the accused committed giving rise to the Covid Charge, while the accused was on bail for the VCGH Charge and related offences.

In the premises, I put little weight on the plea by the accused that he was remorseful.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55">55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the accused committed the Covid offence in April 2021, after the former commander of the accused furnished a testimonial dated 2 October 2020 stating that the charge for hurt that the accused was facing was “completely out of character”. The accused would have been aware that his commander had taken the effort to write a lengthy testimonial to vouch for the character of the accused. It is troubling that the accused appeared indifferent to his commander having staked his credibility to help the accused, by going on to commit the Covid offence even after that testimonial was provided.</a></p><a id="p1_55"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a><a id="p1_56">56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the testimonial that was provided by the former form teacher of the accused, that testimonial is undated. Nevertheless, I note that the testimonial described that the accused “may have accidentally caused hurt during the unexpected fray without any ill intent”. In the light of the VCGH Charge that the accused has pleaded guilty to and the agreed statement of facts, it appears that the impression that was given to his former teacher on the role of the accused in the offence was wrong and misleading. Little weight can be placed on this testimonial.</a></p><a id="p1_56"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a><a id="p1_57">57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the aforesaid reasons, I agree with the prosecution that the accused was as culpable as GEH in the attack. In view of the aggravating factors set out earlier, the uplift of 5 months applied by the General Division of the High Court in <em>GED</em> (at [177]) at the second step, should similarly apply in this case. This lifts the imprisonment term after the second step to 21 months.</a></p><a id="p1_57"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a><a id="p1_58">58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for caning, I am unable to agree with the mitigation plea that caning should not be imposed because of the youth of the accused. In the light of the severe injuries suffered by the victim and the aggravating factors that I have highlighted earlier, the prosecution’s submission of four strokes which is the same as that imposed by the General Division of the High Court in <em>GED</em> was reasonable.</a></p><a id="p1_58"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a><a id="p1_59">59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the individual sentence to be imposed on the accused for the VCGH Charge is 21 months’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane, the same sentence imposed by the General Division of the High Court on GEH for the corresponding charge, before the reduction in that case for the totality principle (at [177], [178]).</a></p><a id="p1_59"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Insulting Modesty Charge</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a><a id="p1_60">60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to the Insulting Modesty Charge, I am unable to agree with the submission in the mitigation plea that as the accused was not involved with GEH sending the messages to others, the accused was less culpable.</a></p><a id="p1_60"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a><a id="p1_61">61&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statement of facts state that “The accused continued to restrain [the victim] while [GEH] and [D] pulled down his pants and underwear to expose his genitals.

Again, the accused was not a mere passive or reluctant participant. The accused pinning down the victim in a chokehold ensured that the victim could be stripped, his genitals exposed, the video taken and distributed, with the victim being unable to offer any resistance against the violent depravity that was being inflicted upon him.</a></p><a id="p1_62"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a><a id="p1_63">63&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While GEH was recording the victim’s injured face and exposed penis, the accused mocked the victim’s penis, encouraged his co-offenders to expose it and continued holding the victim in a chokehold despite the victim being unable to breathe.

In view of these aggravating factors, the prosecution’s proposed sentence of nine months’ imprisonment for the Insulting Modesty Charge is entirely justified. Accordingly, the individual sentence for the Insulting Modesty Charge ought to be nine months’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_66"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Public Order Charge</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a><a id="p1_67">67&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Public Order Charge, I note that the court in <em>GED</em> imposed a fine of $1,500 for a similar charge against GEH in that case. As the culpability of the accused for this offence is similar to GEH, I saw no reason to depart from the fine imposed in that case. Accordingly, I sentenced the accused to a fine of $1,500 (in default, 4 days’ imprisonment).</a></p><a id="p1_67"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Covid Charge</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a><a id="p1_68">68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Covid Charge, in the light of the accused having organised the poker game and committing the offence while he was on bail, I agreed with the prosecution’s submission on sentence and fined the accused $4,000 (in default, 10 days’ imprisonment).</a></p><a id="p1_68"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Totality principle</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a><a id="p1_69">69&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Division of the High Court in <em>GED</em> (at [182], 183]), reduced the total term of imprisonment in its sentence against GEH, from 57 months to 51 months, in the light of the totality principle. The court reasoned that although the provisional aggregate sentence was not substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed, the effect on GEH of the provisional aggregate imprisonment term of 57 months’ imprisonment might be crushing, bearing in mind that he was a first-time offender and the remorse that he demonstrated.</a></p><a id="p1_69"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a><a id="p1_70">70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, I am of the view that the totality principle should not give rise to a need for a reduction. Firstly, the provisional aggregate sentence is not substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed. Secondly, the provisional aggregate term of imprisonment of 30 months for the VCGH Charge and the Insulting Modesty Charge would not be crushing on the accused, bearing in mind that this is more than 40% lower than the total term of imprisonment of 51 months imposed on GEH and that both are first time offenders.</a></p><a id="p1_70"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a><a id="p1_71">71&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the General Division of the High Court in <em>GED</em> took into consideration the remorse of GEH, in reducing the sentence imposed in view of the totality principle (at [182]).
