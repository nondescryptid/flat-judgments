When alcohol is ingested, it circulates in the blood, and the blood in the lungs reaches equilibrium with the air surrounding the blood vessels. The ethanol in alcohol goes in and out of the blood vessels into the surrounding air in the lungs in an on-going process. Breath alcohol analysis relies on the equilibrium which occurs in the lungs between the inspired air and the pulmonary blood in the lungs.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a breath alcohol reading is positive, this could arise from the alcohol in the blood (“blood alcohol”) of a subject, and also from the presence of any alcohol that could be in the subject’s mouth (“mouth alcohol”).<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a> Based on scientific studies, any alcohol present in the mouth would drop to zero within 20 minutes, whether this was alcohol present in the mouth from drinking, alcohol spray or Bonjela gel.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from the presence of mouth alcohol, breathalyser readings can also be elevated after belching if there is unabsorbed alcohol present in high concentration in the subject’s stomach. Based on scientific studies, alcohol is usually completely absorbed in the stomach within 60 minutes after alcohol intake, as the alcohol will then either be released into the intestines or absorbed through the stomach wall, although in some individuals this may take up to 120 minutes. However when the absorption of alcohol is complete, there is minimum or close to zero alcohol in the stomach. Therefore even if an individual then belches, no alcohol vapour will come out to affect the breathalyser reading.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a> This would be true also of Bonjela gel, because once it is ingested into the stomach, it would dissolve into a liquid substance containing alcohol, and its effects would not be any different from any other alcoholic drinks that are consumed by the subject.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW5 opined that in the present case, as the breathalyser test was measured close to two hours after the last application of Bonjela (which she assumed to be at 210am on 14 June 2019)<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a> the amount of alcohol left in the mouth or the stomach of a subject under normal circumstances would be minimal to cause any significant elevation of the breathalyser reading, even if the subject had belched.

It contains two sensors - an infrared sensor and an electrochemical fuel cell sensor. The breath of the subject is analysed for alcohol concentration by both the infrared sensor and the electrochemical fuel cell sensor. The test result reading is what is measured by the infrared sensor.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The infrared sensor contains an infrared curvette, which is a channel with an emitter on one side and a detector on the other side. The emitter emits an infrared signal and the detected signal varies according to the alcohol concentration in the breath. The electrochemical fuel cell sensor also measures alcohol concentration by emitting an electric current to measure the alcohol concentration. It is used as a second sensor to ensure that the results from the two sensors are similar enough and to verify the measured concentration. Both results are compared and they have to be in alignment with the tolerance required by the Singapore Police Force.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Infrared sensor would detect a slowly rising curve ending with a plateau in valid breath test</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a subject blows deeply into the mouthpiece, the machine measures first the breath that is in the mouth, followed by the breath in the upper airways and finally the air in the lungs.

In a valid breath test, the alcohol concentration is slowly rising and is typically a rising curve with a plateau at the end. This plateau indicates the breath alcohol concentration that correlates to the blood alcohol concentration of the subject.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">ACNS and Mouth Alcohol messages given by Drager machine</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A valid breathalyser reading requires three parameters - a minimum blowing volume, minimum blowing time and a plateau detection.

PW6 could only give one example of when a plateau would not be detected, although there could be other reasons for a plateau not being reached. For example, if a subject stopped blowing before he had emptied the air from his lungs, the alcohol concentration would still be rising from his deep lung air and a plateau would not be detected.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Mouth Alcohol message, if there was Bonjela gel present in the subject’s mouth and cavities, the Mouth Alcohol message would appear and the Alcotest SG would not give a reading.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a> The Alcotest SG device detects mouth alcohol by analysing the alcohol concentration curve that comes from the first part of the breath specimen which comes from the mouth.

The rate of absorption of alcohol into the blood would be affected by numerous factors such as gender, weight, metabolic rate, what the accused had eaten. Mere supposition as to the level of alcohol in the accused’s blood would not suffice and expert evidence had to be led as to what might have been the alcohol content in the accused’s blood at the different times: at [14] and [15].</a></p><a id="p1_54"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a><a id="p1_55">55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Public Prosecutor v Shahi Neetish Kumar</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22823-SSP.xml')">[2019] SGDC 31</a> (“<em>Shahi Neetish</em>”), the court had declined to accept prosecution’s submission that there was a general proposition that Limb b required the accused to lead expert evidence on issues such as the accused’s blood-breath ratio to calculate the rate at which his body absorbed alcohol, the rate at which his body eliminated alcohol and the accused’s body weight. However the court agreed with the observations of the English High Court in <em>DPP v Dukolli</em> [2009] EWHC 3097 that although the court had a discretion to find that the assumption could be discharged without scientific evidence, this would only be in the comparatively rare case where a layman could reliably and confidently say that the post-event alcohol could explain the excess alcohol in the accused’s breath.

Before DW1 took the stand to clarify his Alcotech test report, PW5 had fairly pointed out that the Alcotech report described the accused as “ingesting” Bonjela, and the test should have simulated as closely as possible that the accused had applied gel in his oral cavity. This was because having the accused ingest or swallow the gel was more equivalent to the accused taking alcohol directly into his system, and the Alcotech mouth alcohol readings might otherwise have taken longer than 10 minutes to drop to zero.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65">65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accepted PW5’s testimony that under normal circumstances the alcohol in Bonjela would have dropped to zero in the oral cavity within 20 minutes after application. This was consistent with the Defence’s Alcotech test report, which showed that the mouth alcohol readings from the application of Bonjela dropping to zero in 10 minutes. I also accepted PW5’s opinion that it was unlikely that the accused’s application of Bonjela gel had any significant contribution to the Alcotest SG breathalyser test conducted at 404am.

A trace of Bonjela in the crack-line could potentially give rise to a high reading because of the percentage of ethanol in Bonjela.

The mouth alcohol effect was random and would change every time a subject breathed out, as could be seen from the results of the Alcotech test report. If two breathalyser tests were done one or two minutes apart and there was mouth alcohol, the two significantly different readings would alert that the readings were not reliable and that mouth alcohol was present.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72">72&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also accepted PW 5’s evidence she could not rule out the presence of mouth alcohol based on a single breathalyser reading.

The Alcotech witness DW1 had also given a similar opinion that Bonjela gel trapped in the crack-line would prohibit the evaporation of mouth alcohol in a timely manner, although he himself had not conducted any investigation on this as he was not aware that the accused had a cracked tooth.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73">73&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This notwithstanding, PW5 had made it clear in her testimony that she was not testifying that the only way to rule out mouth alcohol from Bonjela gel trapped in the tooth crack-line was to conduct two breathalyser tests, nor was she saying there was indeed Bonjela gel trapped in the accused’s tooth crack-line when the Alcotest SG breathalyser tests were done.</a></p><a id="p1_73"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a><a id="p1_74">74&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, PW5 highlighted that she was not familiar with the workings of the Alcotest SG device and was unable to comment on whether the machine could detect mouth alcohol or Bonjela gel trapped in the tooth crack-line.

She noted that no simulation experiment was done where gel was applied to the tooth crack-line to verify that Bonjela gel could get trapped and how long it would remain there. She was not a dentist and variables would include the size of the crack-line and the amount of gel that could have become trapped.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77">77&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Central to this defence that Bonjela gel trapped in the accused’s cracked tooth had elevated the breathalyser readings taken at 404am would be the need for the Defence, who bore the burden of proof on this issue, to point to some evidence that there could still be Bonjela gel trapped in the accused’s tooth crack-line producing mouth alcohol more than two hours after the accused’s last application of Bonjela gel.

I had also given the accused the benefit of the doubt on his claims about his manner of driving and that there were no circumstances that had increased the danger to other road users. According to the accused he had driven about two km home and was in control of his vehicle, and the in-camera video showed little vehicular or human traffic at that time of the night. The circumstances that led to the confrontation between PW4 the complainant and the accused at the carpark were not clearly established. Although the arresting officer PW1 testified that the complainant had told him at the scene that he was nearly knocked down by the accused, the curiously-forgetful complainant repeatedly claimed that he could not recall what led to the confrontation and he could not give any “confirmed answer” about whether he was nearly hit by the accused’s vehicle or not.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138">138&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view a sentence above the moderate range was appropriate.

As the court in <em>Edwin Suse Nathan</em> observed, a driving disqualification order combines the three sentencing objectives of punishment, protection of the public and deterrence. The two components of a sentence of fine or jail and disqualification are not mutually compensatory and an increase in fine or jail should not be taken to mandate the imposition of a reduced period of disqualification: at [13].</a></p><a id="p1_138"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a><a id="p1_139">139&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the court in <em>Kwan Weiguang v PP</em> [2022] SGHC 121observed the imposition of disqualification takes effect above and beyond the primary sentence of an imprisonment term or fine, and a sufficiently lengthy disqualification order reminds an offender every day of his offence and that he is not permitted to drive because of his bad behavior.
