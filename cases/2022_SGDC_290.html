As of July 2022, Certis had deployed a total of 34 officers to TRB to carry out the enforcement works for HSA (“Certis TRB officers”). The Certis TRB officers were non-auxiliary police officers and authorised officers under s 19(1) of the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act 1993 (“TCASA”). They were issued with an “HSA authority card” and authorised to conduct search, inspection, seizure under the provisions of TCASA and to apprehend offenders for the purchase, use, possession and selling of prohibited tobacco-related products.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under s 19(3) of the TCASA, every authorised officer is deemed to be a public servant within the meaning of the Penal Code 1871.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SOF for Chew revealed that whenever there were operations mounted by TRB, Certis TRB officers would be tasked to seize prohibited tobacco-related products in their capacity as enforcement officers authorised under the TCASA. As part of the seizure process, they were required to account for the seized items by taking photographs of the seizures made and issuing acknowledgement receipts to offenders whom the items were seized from. If the quantity of the seized items was too large, Certis TRB officers would be tasked to transport the seized items back to Certis Cisco Bukit Timah located at 2 Toh Tuck Terrace, before carrying out the documentation and photography of the seized items.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime between October 2021 and January 2022, on three separate occasions, Chew, whilst carrying out enforcement duties as a Certis TRB officer during three separate TRB operations, and in such capacity as a public servant being entrusted with dominion over at least eight packs of e-vaporiser pods and at least 15 pieces of e-vaporiser pods valued at $227/-, dishonestly misappropriated the said property. Chew did not document or seize the aforementioned items, and instead brought them home.</a></p><a id="p1_17"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the vaporiser pods were taken home by Chew for the purpose of his own consumption because he wanted to try certain flavours of the vaporiser pods. Chew also gave four to five boxes of the misappropriated e-vaporiser pods to his colleague, Muhammad Faddley Bin Abdul Wahid (“Faddley”), on two occasions. At the material time, Faddley was an Enforcement Officer under the employ of Certis.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By virtue of the foregoing, Chew has committed an offence punishable under s 409 of the PC, which charge is amalgamated pursuant to s 124(2) of the CPC and punishable under s 124(8)(a)(i) of the CPC.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of Chew’s offence, the quantities of tobacco-related items seized in the three HSA operations were understated. Given that the items misappropriated by Chew were not recovered, the ownership of those items could not be determined. This impacted the integrity of the investigations in the three HSA operations.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chew admitted to his offences and the SOF without qualification.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Statement of Facts for Steven </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Statement of Facts which Steven admitted to without qualification (“SOF for Steven”) revealed that between 17 September 2018 and 8 August 2022, Steven was employed by Certis as an Enforcement Officer. Sometime around February 2020, he was deployed to the EOU under the TRB of HSA.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the duties of the Certis TRB officers included the collection of prohibited tobacco-related products stored in the HSA metal bins in Changi Airport terminals. These prohibited tobacco-related products were in the possession of travellers who entered Singapore via airport terminals. Traveller could dispose of these products without any repercussions by filling up a Voluntary Disposal Receipt (“VDR”) stating their personal details and the quantity of the prohibited items. After submitting the VDR form to ICA, an ICA officer would retrieve the key to the metal bin and dispose the prohibited tobacco-related products in a blue bin within the metal bin. The blue bin remained locked, but the products could be disposed through a hole at the top of the blue bin. Thereafter, the ICA officer would lock the metal bin.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every week or whenever the metal bins are full or near maximum capacity, HSA would issue ad-hoc requests to Certis to collect the prohibited tobacco-related products from the airport terminals for disposal. Some Certis TRB officers would be deployed to the airport terminals to perform the collection duty. Certis TRB officers deployed would have to proceed to the TRB office at 3 Biopolis Drive to collect the keys to the HSA blue bins located within the metal bins.</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day of collection, Certis TRB officers would meet the outsourced disposal vendor from Asia Medical Enviro Services Pte Ltd (“AMES”) at the carpark of the designated arrival hall of each airport terminal. Certis TRB officers would take over empty black bins provided by AMES and proceed to the restrict area within the arrival halls. The AMES staff would wait at the carpark because they are unable to enter the restricted area.</a></p><a id="p1_25"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Certis team arrives at the ICA’s office at the arrival hall, one of the Certis TRB officers would sign on the HSA Disposal Bin Clearance Record Hand Over-Taking Over (“HO-TO”) form which documented the date and time of the handover, and the names of the Certis TRB and ICA officers. An ICA officer would hand the filled VDR forms to the Certis TRB officers and escort the Certis TRB officers to the HSA metal bin. The ICA officer would unlock the metal bin while the Certis TRB officers would unlock the inner blue bin. The ICA officer would leave the area after opening the metal bin, leaving the Cisco TRB officers to transfer the contents of the blue bin into the empty black bin provided by AMES using zip-tied trash bags. Once the blue bin was emptied, it would be locked by the Certis TRB officers. The ICA officer would then return to lock the metal bin.</a></p><a id="p1_26"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereafter, the Certis TRB officers would exit the restricted area and handover the black bins to the AMES staff. The same process would be repeated for all terminals and after all the airport terminals are cleared, AMES would proceed to the incineration plant located at Tuas for the destruction of the prohibited tobacco-related items under the escort of the Certis TRB officers. The National Environment Agency (“NEA”) would then issue a certificate of destriction to AMES, in which the weight of the items collected from the respective airport terminals would be reflected. AMES would forward a scanned copy of the disposal certificate to TRB. On the same day, the Certis TRB officers would return the keys and the VDR forms to the TRB office.</a></p><a id="p1_27"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime in 2021 and 2022, several Certis TRB officers who were tasked to perform the collection duties described above started to misappropriate contraband cigarettes, e-vaporisers, and e-vaporiser pods products from the HSA blue bins. The Certis TRB officers realised that there was an opportunity for them to misappropriate tobacco-related products. First, the ICA officer or AMES staff would not be around when the Certis TRB officers transferred the contents of the blue bin to the empty black bin. Second, there was no record of the amount, description, or weight of the items collected from the blue bin. Third, there was also no procedure to ensure that the items collected from the blue bin tallied with the items declared in the VDR forms. Recognising this opportunity, the Certis TRB officers, when transferring the contents of the blue bin to the empty black bin, would pocket a portion of the contraband cigarettes, e-vaporisers, and e-vaporiser pods products by packing them into a separate plastic bag. The remaining products would be packed into the empty black bin provided by AMES. Thereafter, the Certis TRB officers would keep the separate plastic bag in the Certis van parked at the carpark, before handing the black bin to the AMES staff. The misappropriated items were stolen property in respect of which the offence of criminal breach of trust by public servant under s 409 of the Penal Code has been committed.</a></p><a id="p1_28"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereafter, the misappropriated items would be shared among the team of Certis TRB officers tasked to perform the airport collection duties. On some occasions, they would also share the misappropriated items with other Certis TRB officers who were not deployed to perform such collection duties. Chong Wan Siong (“Chong”), Vijeyen Sargaren (“Vijeyen”) and Steven were among the officers who received the misappropriated items; the three of them were never deployed to perform such collection duties. Typically, the Certis TRB officers who receive the misappropriated items would either take them from their colleagues directly, or take them from the Certis van when it was parked the airport terminals or parked at the Certis CISCO Bukit Timah located at 2 Toh Tuck Terrace. Gradually, the sharing of misappropriate items among the Certis TRB officers became an “open secret” or “unspoken rule” among them.</a></p><a id="p1_29"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Facts Pertaining to DAC-916330-2022</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime between October 2021 and November 2021, in Singapore, on at least six separate occasions, Steven dishonestly received at least 10 packs of contraband cigarettes and 1 disposable e-vaporiser, valued at $220/-, from one Mohamad Aidil Bin Abu Bakar (“Aidil”), a 44-year-old male Singaporean and other Certis TRB officers who were deployed for the airport collection duty together with Aidil. At the material time, Aidil was an Assistant Enforcement Supervisor under the employ of Certis. Aidil was one of the Certis TRB officers who was deployed to collect the prohibited tobacco-related products from the airport terminals. The said items were misappropriated by Aidil and other Certis TRB officers from the HSA blue bins in the manner described above. Therefore, the items were stolen property in respect of which the offence of criminal breach of trust by public servant under s 409 of the PC has been committed.</a></p><a id="p1_30"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the six separate occasions that Steven received stolen property, he would receive them by either taking the misappropriated item from Aidil directly, or taking them from the Certis van parked at the airport terminals or Certis CISCO Bukit Timah after Aidil and other Certis TRB officers place the misappropriate items in the Certis van.</a></p><a id="p1_31"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steven knew that the said items that he had dishonestly received were stolen property in respect of which the offence of criminal breach of trust by public servant under s 409 of the PC has been committed. He received those items for the purpose of his personal consumption. By virtue of the foregoing, Steven has committed an offence punishable s 411(1) of the PC which is an amalgamated charge pursuant to s 124(2) of the CPC and punishable under s 124(8)(a)(i) of the CPC.</a></p><a id="p1_32"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Facts Pertaining to DAC-916331-2022</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime in the year 2020, in the vicinity of Geylang, Singapore, Steven did possess, other than for the purpose of sale in Singapore, one set of “SP2” brand e-vaporiser. Steven purchased the said e-vaporiser from an online seller whom he contacted via Telegram. The aforementioned item is an article designed to resemble a tobacco product and is therefore an imitation tobacco product.</a></p><a id="p1_33"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By having in his possession other than for sale an imitation tobacco product, he has thereby contravened s 16(2A)(a) of the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act (Cap 309, 2011 Rev Ed) and committed an offence punishable under s 16(6) of the same Act.</a></p><a id="p1_34"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steven admitted to his offences and the SOF without qualification.</a></p><a id="p1_35"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prosecution’s Address on Sentence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution submitted that the present case involved Certis officers who have brazenly committed dishonesty-related offences in severe dereliction of their duties as law enforcement officers. The offences were committed by the Accused persons when they were public servants, namely, enforcement officers of HSA’s TRB in the course of their official duties, and a deterrent sentence is warranted.</a></p><a id="p1_36"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Chew, he had misappropriated prohibited tobacco-related items that he was tasked to seize during the TRB’s operations. While Steven, Chong, and Vijeyen were not directly involved in misappropriating the items and did not technically receive the items in the course of their official duties, a deterrent custodial sentence is warranted as they knowingly received the illegal tobacco-related products misappropriated by other Certis TRB officers and failed to enforce the laws against their errant colleagues. This undoubtedly damaged the institutional credibility of both TRB and Certis and have harmed the public interest and have the potential to undermine public confidence in law enforcement agencies and the proper administration of criminal justice.</a></p><a id="p1_37"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution further submitted that the offences were difficult to detect and committed over a long duration. Chew and the officers who had collected the tobacco-related products at the airport terminals, took advantage of the opportunity to misappropriate the items without accounting for them, and the other Certis TRB officers (Steven, Chong and Vijeyen) helped to keep the CBT offences a secret and were complicit in receiving the misappropriated items.

The items misappropriated were not recovered and Chew did not make any restitution. Therefore, the Prosecution submitted that a sentence of at least <u>five months’ imprisonment</u> would be appropriate for Chew.</a></p><a id="p1_41"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a><a id="p1_42">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the offence of dishonestly receiving stolen property under s 411 of the PC, the Prosecution submitted that there is a dearth of sentencing precedents involving public servants who had dishonestly received stolen property and similarly cited precedents involving dishonesty-related Penal Code offences committed by law enforcement officers.</a></p><a id="p1_42"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a><a id="p1_43">43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution submitted that the present case is more egregious as the Accused persons were in possession of illegal tobacco-related products and have committed the very offences that they were supposed to prevent. They had abused their position as Certis TRB officers to access the prohibited items for their personal gain and the offence is clearly systemic and of a significantly larger scale.</a></p><a id="p1_43"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a><a id="p1_44">44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution submitted that the culpability of the Accused persons who dishonestly received the misappropriated items is comparable to those who physically carried out the misappropriation as both groups had a long-established and common understanding that the misappropriated items would be shared amongst the larger group of Certis TRB officers. Hence, the sentences for this group should not be significantly lower than the latter group.</a></p><a id="p1_44"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a><a id="p1_45">45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As against Chong and Vijeyen, the Prosecution submitted for a short custodial sentence of at least two weeks’ imprisonment as the value of the items received is low (at least 20 sticks of cigarettes valued at $5/-). As for Steven, the Prosecution calibrated the sentence downwards from Chew’s proposed sentence by one-month as it involved a similar value and submitted that a sentence of <u>four months’ imprisonment</u> would be appropriate for Steven.</a></p><a id="p1_45"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a><a id="p1_46">46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the charge for possession of illegal tobacco products (one set of e-vaporiser) under s 16(2A)(a) p/u s 16(6) of the TCASA, the Prosecution submitted that a fine of $500/- is typically imposed on first-time offenders who were in possession of small quantities of tobacco products. As Steven also has one TIC charge under s 16 TCASA involving four boxes of assorted pods (three pieces of pods per box), a <u>fine of at least $800/-</u> would be appropriate.</a></p><a id="p1_46"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigation for Chew</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a><a id="p1_47">47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his mitigation plea, Chew admitted that he did not follow the Standard Operating Procedure (“SOP”) in handling the items.

They were entrusted and deployed by HSA to carry out enforcement works against tobacco contraventions.</a></p><a id="p1_54"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a><a id="p1_55">55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Chew misappropriated the contraband tobacco-related items that he was tasked to seize during the TRB’s operations and committed the offences in the course of his official duties. On three separate occasions, Chew did not document or seize the prohibited tobacco-related products during the TRB operations but instead brought them home for his own consumption. He also gave some of the misappropriated e-vaporiser pods to his colleague, Faddley on two occasions.</a></p><a id="p1_55"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a><a id="p1_56">56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chew’s dishonest misappropriation of the seized tobacco-related items resulted in the quantities of the items seized in the three HSA operations being understated when it should have been properly documented and accounted for and has called into question the integrity of the investigations. His conduct has clearly damaged the institutional credibility of both HSA and Certis, and a deterrent sentence is warranted (<em>PP v Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/9601-SSP-M.xml')">[2007] 4 SLR(R) 753</a> at [37]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57">57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As highlighted by the Prosecution, such offences were difficult to detect and the offences were not one-off lapse of judgment but were premediated and committed on multiple occasions to the extent that the sharing of misappropriated items became an “open secret” or “unspoken rule” among the Certis TRB officers.</a></p><a id="p1_57"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a><a id="p1_58">58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, by either misappropriating the items or dishonestly receiving the misappropriated items for their own consumption, the Accused persons would be in possession of the illegal tobacco-related product, and it would constitute separated offences under the Customs Act and TCASA.</a></p><a id="p1_58"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a><a id="p1_59">59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a survey of the sentencing precedents cited by the Prosecution involving police officers who had pleaded guilty to a charge of s 409 of the PC involving CBT of cash of not negligible sum ($50/- and $300/- respectively), the offenders each received an imprisonment term of two months to three months respectively (see <em>PP v Norazly Bin Joihani</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16838-SSP.xml')">[2015] SGDC 13</a> and <em>PP v Pat Chung Keong</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25051-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGDC 223</a>). I note that in both cases, the offenders held the rank of Sergeant, a relatively senior appointment, and Norazly also worked as an Investigating Officer and faced multiple forgery and cheating offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60">60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the offenders claimed trial and was convicted after trial, and the cash amount or value of the items misappropriated were higher and closer to $1000/- (<em>PP v Amir Hamzah bin Mohammad</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2012] SGHC 0165.xml')">[2012] SGHC 165</a> and <em>PP v Hemavathy d/o Gunasekaran</em> (DAC 932331-2018)); or where the offender faced more than one s 409 PC charge (<em>PP v Low Mong Nguang</em> (DAC-911677-2014 &amp; Ors)), the offenders each received an imprisonment term of six months to seven months.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61">61&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, while Chew’s offence is not an isolated incident and he has misappropriated the e-vaporiser pods amounting to $227/- on three occasions between October 2021 and January 2022, I was of the view that the learned DPP’s submission of five months’ imprisonment is slightly on the high side in light of the sentences of six months and seven months’ imprisonment received by the cases cited by the Prosecution police officers who have claimed trial to their offences and has not shown any remorse for their offences. In my assessment, a custodial sentence in the range of three to four months’ imprisonment would be an appropriate sentence for Chew.</a></p><a id="p1_61"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a><a id="p1_62">62&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that Chew has elected to plead guilty at the first mention when he was first charged for this offence, that this is his first brush with the law, and that he is deeply remorseful for the offence, I was of the view that a sentence of three months’ imprisonment would be appropriate and would adequately address the effect of a deterrence sentence and serve the ends of justice.</a></p><a id="p1_62"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a><a id="p1_63">63&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I next turn to the appropriate sentences to be imposed for the s 411 PC charges against Steven, and for completeness, Chong and Vijeyen. As highlighted by the Prosecution, there is a dearth of sentencing precedents involving public servants who had dishonestly received stolen property. From the precedents surveyed by the Prosecution involving such offences committed by law enforcement officers, custodial sentences have been imposed.</a></p><a id="p1_63"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a><a id="p1_64">64&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, given that the Accused persons were fully aware that the prohibited items were misappropriated by their Certis TRB colleagues who were deployed to collect the prohibited tobacco-related products from the airport terminals, and that as Certis TRB officer, they were entrusted to carry out enforcement works against, <em>inter alia</em>, the possession of such prohibited items, I agreed with the learned DPP that there was a dereliction of their duties and the Accused persons have damaged the institutional credibility of both the TRB and Certis.</a></p><a id="p1_64"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a><a id="p1_65">65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, I was of the view that it would be appropriate to impose a custodial sentence against Chong and Vijeyen, notwithstanding the low value of the misappropriated contraband cigarettes that they had dishonestly received. In this regard, I agreed with the Prosecution that a short custodial sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate to send a signal that such conduct would not be tolerated and that such offenders can expect a custodial sentence to serve as a deterrence.</a></p><a id="p1_65"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a><a id="p1_66">66&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Steven, I was not entirely persuaded by the Prosecution’s submission that his sentence should be pegged close to the sentence for Chew on account that the value of the items stated in their charges were of a similar sum, and that the amalgamated charge against Steven involved six separate occasions, while Chew involved three separate occasions.</a></p><a id="p1_66"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a><a id="p1_67">67&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the offences committed by the Certis TRB officers involved dishonestly and they had abused their positions for their personal gain, and undermined public trust and confidence in the enforcement authorities, given the facts and circumstances of the case, I was of the view that the culpability of the Accused persons who dishonestly received the misappropriated items could be considered lower than that of Chew and the other Certis TRB officers who committed the s 409 PC offences.</a></p><a id="p1_67"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a><a id="p1_68">68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the officers who physically carried out the misappropriation offences, Chong, Vijeyen and Steven were not directly involved in misappropriating the items as they were not deployed to collect the prohibited tobacco-related products from the airport terminals. As conceded by the Prosecution, the three of them did not technically receive the misappropriated items in the course of their official duties unlike Chew and the other officers deployed for the collection.</a></p><a id="p1_68"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a><a id="p1_69">69&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, from the Statement of Facts, there was nothing to suggest that there were any conspiracy or common intention on the part of these officers to commit the offence of CBT as a public servant. Hence, in respect of the sentence to be imposed on Steven, I was of the view that he should receive a higher imprisonment term than Chong and Vijeyen on account of the higher value of misappropriated item received, while at the same time, I was mindful that his sentence should not be calibrated too high that it is close to that of Chew’s sentence, bearing in mind that their offences and culpability are not entirely identical. In my assessment, a custodial sentence in the range of four to six weeks’ imprisonment would be an appropriate sentence for Steven.</a></p><a id="p1_69"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a><a id="p1_70">70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Chew, Steven has elected to plead guilty at the first mention when he was first charged for this offence. This is his first brush with the law and he is deeply remorseful for the offence. Having carefully considered the Prosecution’s sentencing submissions, and having regard to all the facts and circumstances of the case, I was of the view that a custodial sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment would reflect the culpability of this offender and adequately address the need for a deterrence sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_70"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a><a id="p1_71">71&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For completeness, I agreed with the Prosecution that a fine of $800/- would be appropriate for the TCASA charge that Steven pleaded guilty to, having regard to the additional charge that is taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. As Steven is not in a position to pay the fine, I imposed a sentence of four days’ imprisonment in default of the fine of $800/-.</a></p><a id="p1_71"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a><a id="p1_72">72&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having carefully considered all facts and circumstances of the case, I imposed a sentence of <u>three (3) months' imprisonment</u> on Chew for the offence of s 409 PC.</a></p><a id="p1_72"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a><a id="p1_73">73&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Steven, I imposed a sentence of <u>four (4) weeks’ imprisonment</u> for the s 411 PC offence, a sentence that is higher than the sentences imposed on Chong and Vijeyen for a similar offence, involving a lower value item and similarly culpability.</a></p><a id="p1_73"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a><a id="p1_74">74&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prosecution, being dissatisfied, has filed an appeal against the sentences imposed on Chew and Steven.
