The Accused took advantage of the young girl's innocence, using his position of trust to satisfy his own depraved desires. This case exemplifies an abominable betrayal of trust and a flagrant disregard for the fundamental principles of human decency. Despite the irrefutable evidence against him, the Accused elected to go to trial and presented a defence that was a mere afterthought, contrived solely to evade culpability and avoid accountability for his reprehensible criminal behaviour.</a></p><a id="p1_1"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Charges</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution proceeded on three charges under Section 354(2) of the Penal Code.

It is understandable that the victim, being a pre-pubescent child, was uncertain about the nature of the substance. However, there is no dispute that the semen belonged to the Accused.

She clarified that she delayed telling her mother because “S” was present in the hotel room, and she wanted to inform her mother only when “S” was not around, as she feared “S” might reprimand her. The victim recollected informing her mother that the Accused had bitten her right nipple, right ear, licked her private part, put his private part in her mouth and his white-colour liquid came out.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon learning of the incident, the victim's mother was "shocked and fierce" and informed “S” about it upon his return to the hotel room<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a>.

This evidence was presented in a report prepared by PW7 Dr. Thong Zhonghui, which was marked as exhibit P5 in court. The report stated that semen was conclusively found on two exhibits seized from the scene of the incident. These exhibits were the interior front of the victim's t-shirt and the exterior side of her pants.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Thong further explained that he had conducted a series of tests to determine the presence of semen on these exhibits. First, he conducted a presumptive test known as the AP test, which tests for the presence of acid phosphatase, a marker commonly found in semen. If this test is positive, then Dr. Thong would conduct a confirmatory test known as the semenogelin and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test. To conclude that semen was conclusively present on an exhibit, both the semenogelin and PSA test must be positive.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on these tests, Dr. Thong confirmed that semen was present in the areas on the interior front of the victim's t-shirt and the exterior side of her pants. The DNA profile obtained from the spermic fraction extracted from the sperm cells found on these exhibits was a match to the Accused's DNA profile. The probability of finding a DNA profile belonging to the Accused was estimated to be 1 in 750 septillion based on the Indian population.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Dr. Thong could not conclusively state that semen was present on the area at the exterior front of the victim's panties, the DNA test that was conducted subsequently showed that the spermic fraction extracted from the sperm cells matched the Accused's DNA. Dr. Thong clarified in his oral testimony that in relation to the victim's panties, the DNA profile from the spermic fraction was a mixture of the Accused's DNA profile as the major contributor and another uninterpretable DNA profile as the lower contributor. The probability of finding a DNA profile belonging to the Accused was estimated to be 1 in 190 sextillion based on the Indian population.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">PW10 – The Victim’s Mother</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>PW10</b>, the victim’s mother gave evidence during her cross-examination that the victim seemed frightened when she first returned to the hotel room. The victim subsequently made a swift complaint to her mother that she had been sexually assaulted by the Accused after “S” had left the hotel room. As previously noted, the victim's testimony was that she informed her mother at around 4:00 am on 15 November 2020 that the Accused had bitten her right nipple and right ear and licked her private part and put his private part in her mouth, and his white-colour liquid came out.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a> During her oral testimony, PW10, confirmed that in the early hours of the morning, shortly after midnight, the victim informed her that the Accused had instructed her to remove her clothes (shirt, pants and underwear) and bit her right ear and right nipple. The victim also told her that the Accused took his penis near her mouth and took his thumb and rubbed it on her body.

The "unusually convincing" standard denotes a situation where the witness's testimony is so persuasive that the Prosecution's case is proven beyond reasonable doubt based solely on the evidence provided. As noted in <b><em>Mohammed Liton v PP</em></b> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/56310-M.xml')">[2008] 1 SLR 601</a> at [38], "<em>a complainant’s testimony would be unusually convincing if the testimony, when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused</em>."</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To determine whether a witness's testimony is unusually convincing, the court takes into account several factors, such as the witness's demeanour and the internal and external consistency of her evidence.</a></p><a id="p1_30"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the instant case the victim was a young girl who was 9 years old at the time of the offence. And in this respect, I took into consideration the Court of Appeal's affirmation in <b><em>GCK</em></b> at [97] of the position held by the Canadian Supreme Court in <b><em>R v W(R) [RW]</em></b> [1992] 2 SCR 122 at [25-27] that children are no longer considered a suspect category of witnesses. The court concluded that the assessment of children's evidence should not be based on rigid stereotypes but rather on a common-sense approach. In accordance with the child's mental development, understanding, and ability to communicate, each child witness's credibility and evidence should be evaluated based on appropriate criteria, irrespective of their age.</a></p><a id="p1_31"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence of the Victim</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found the evidence of the victim to be clear and consistent and when viewed in the totality of the circumstances including the corroborative evidence led by the Prosecution, to be not only unusually convincing but also internally and externally consistent. The child victim appeared to me to be earnest in recounting the events that occurred on the morning of 14 November 2020, without any motive or inclination to falsely implicate the Accused beyond narrating her own personal experience, which no doubt must have been a traumatising one for her. Minor aberrations in the recollection of minor details did not materially affect her evidence at all.</a></p><a id="p1_32"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Corroborative Evidence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">DNA Evidence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was however an additional important piece of evidence in this case in the form of DNA of the Accused found on two exhibits, namely the area on the interior front of the victim’s t-shirt and the area at the exterior side of the victim’s pants which corroborated the evidence of the victim.</a></p><a id="p1_33"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above evidence then needed to be evaluated together with the uncontradicted evidence of the victim’s mother PW10. In summary, the DNA evidence presented in this case provided strong support for the victim's account that the Accused had ejaculated on her exposed chest. The DNA tests conducted by Dr. Thong showed that semen was conclusively present on the victim's t-shirt and pants, and the DNA profiles obtained from these exhibits matched the Accused's DNA profile with a very high degree of certainty. The DNA profile obtained from the spermic fraction on the exterior front of the victim's panties also matched the Accused's DNA profile.</a></p><a id="p1_34"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A crucial aspect of the Accused's defence is his account of the DNA evidence. During his examination-in-chief, he claimed that his semen was discovered on the inside of the victim's shirt and the outside of her trousers, and that his DNA was detected on her underwear because he had engaged in phone sex with his wife earlier that morning and ejaculated on his bed, pillow and sheets. He even claimed that the walls next to him were damp.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a> He argued that the victim may have come into contact with his semen and then touched herself, which he claimed is how his semen ended up on those parts of her clothing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is this claim far-fetched, but the Accused himself also admitted that it was pure speculation without any supporting evidence. <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a> He did not present any evidence or summon any witness to corroborate his assertion about engaging in phone sex. In any case, his account of ejaculating after a supposed phone sex session is utterly unbelievable and devoid of any credibility or truthfulness. The Accused acknowledged that he could not explain how the semen found on the physical surfaces ended up on the relevant parts of the victim's clothing, leaving a significant gap in his defence. His only explanation was that it "could have" happened, as he was unsure if it was even true, which casts grave doubt on the veracity of his claim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, it is abundantly clear that the defence put forth by the Accused is nothing but an afterthought to save himself from the overwhelming evidence against him. It is noteworthy that the Accused's Case for the Defence (CFD), which was submitted after the Prosecution had already presented its case and the DNA evidence it planned to rely on, did not mention this defence. The absence of this defence in the CFD raises a strong inference that it is a fabricated and belated claim, made in desperation to counter the prosecution's evidence.</a></p><a id="p1_37"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, during the Defence's cross-examination of the Prosecution witnesses, there was no mention of this defence. It was only raised for the first time during the Accused's examination-in-chief, despite being a significant part of the Accused's defence. Dr Thong was not questioned on whether it was possible for semen to be transferred in the manner alleged or if semen could be detected hours after the alleged ejaculation post-phone sex and the victim's arrival in the room.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a> Similarly, during the victim's testimony, the defence did not inquire whether she had touched the semen on the Accused's bed, wall, or pillow or whether she had touched herself after that.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> The Accused belated claim is without doubt an afterthought based solely on speculation.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Corroboration by PW10</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In assessing the evidence given by PW10, I was mindful that the Courts in Singapore have taken a different approach to corroborative evidence as compared to the Baskerville standard of “independent evidence implicating the Appellant in a material particular”. Instead, the focus in Singapore is on the substance and relevance of the evidence, and whether it supports or confirms the material that it is meant to corroborate. This was discussed in detail by the Court of Appeal in <b><em>AOF v Public Prosecutor</em></b> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 3 SLR 0034.xml')">[2012] 3 SLR 34</a> at [173] - [175], which confirmed that the more liberal approach to interpreting corroborative evidence is applicable in the local context.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the aforementioned guidance, I found that there was reasonable basis to conclude that the testimony of the victim's mother substantiates critical elements of the victim's account. The victim’s mother testified under cross-examination that upon the victim's return to the hotel room, she appeared to be visibly frightened. Subsequently, the victim promptly reported to her mother in graphic detail how the Accused had sexually assaulted her following the departure of “S” from the room. It should be noted that the victim attested to informing her mother of the incident at approximately 4.00am on 15 November 2020.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a> Based on this testimony, I found that the victim's version of events that the Accused <em>bit her right nipple and right ear and licked her private part and put his private part in her mouth, and his white-colour liquid came out</em>, was sufficiently corroborated by PW10’s evidence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She further testified that the victim disclosed that the Accused warned her not to disclose the incident to her mother.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a> The victim's mother verified that the victim recounted the incident as having occurred at the Accused's residence. Although, there were some minor discrepancies in the narration of events by PW10, such as the exact time when the victim told her of the incident I was of the view that such details were insignificant to affect the corroborative value of her evidence. In this regard I considered that such minor discrepancies in witness testimony may be attributed to the inherent variability in individual perspectives and interpretations, as no two persons are capable of describing an event in precisely identical terms. In evaluating the credibility of witnesses, courts commonly acknowledge the potential for human error in observation, retention, and recall.

Notably, there is no mention of coaching or extortion in the Accused's VRI statement recorded under s 22 of the CPC or the cautioned statements recorded under s 23 of the CPC. Significantly the cautioned statements record that he had “nothing” to say, and “no need to say anything” when asked if he had anything to say in his defence when the charges were read to him.

The court should prioritise offence-specific factors, which can be divided into three primary categories. The first two categories are generally related to the offender's culpability, while the third pertains to the harm caused to the victim. The degree of sexual exploitation is a crucial factor in the first category, which encompasses several elements such as the accused's actions towards the victim, the body part(s) touched, and the duration of the offence.

In respect of premeditation, even if it was not premeditated in the sense that he had planned earlier, there was a significant degree of opportunism on his part, in that he took advantage of the situation and on the pretext of taking the victim to a nearby 7-11 store, took her to his room. Such use of deception by the accused is also a relevant aggravating factor which would bring his case to the higher end of the spectrum of Band 2. I assessed the indicative range for the offences to be 24 months imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_57"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Offender Specific Factors</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a><a id="p1_58">58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then considered the offender specific factors. The offender is for all intents and purposes a first offender but with multiple charges, and was not entitled to any discount that may be applied in cases where an offender had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. He showed no remorse throughout the trial.</a></p><a id="p1_58"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Precedents</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a><a id="p1_59">59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The learned DPP cited two cases in support of her sentencing submissions.</a></p><a id="p1_59"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a><a id="p1_60">60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <b><em>GBR</em></b> the appellant's niece, who was 13 years old at the time of the offence, was the victim of the sexual assault. The appellant convinced the victim to go to his apartment to study, claiming it would be better than staying at home due to her parents' quarrel. While alone in the apartment, the appellant touched the victim inappropriately by fondling her breasts, touching her genitals after removing her underwear and licking her vagina for a total of 10 minutes. He was charged with one count of sexual assault under Section 354(2) of the Penal Code. The appellant was found guilty after a trial and sentenced to 21 months imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane. On appeal, the sentence was increased to 25 months imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane.</a></p><a id="p1_60"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a><a id="p1_61">61&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find the present case to be equally egregious, if not more so, despite the fact that the abuse of trust was more severe in <b><em>GBR</em></b>. This is because the victim in the present case was only 9 years old, much younger than the victim in <b><em>GBR</em></b>.</a></p><a id="p1_61"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a><a id="p1_62">62&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prosecution also cited the case of <b><em>Public Prosecutor v BNO</em></b> [2018] SGHC 2432 ("<b><em>BNO</em></b>"), where the accused was found guilty after a trial on one charge under section 354(2) of the Penal Code and two charges under section 376(4)(b) of the Penal Code. The offences were committed against a 9-year-old victim who happened to be the best friend of the accused's son. While the victim was staying over at the accused's home and sleeping, the accused moved his finger over the victim's penis, over his shorts. He then pulled the victim’s shorts down and moved his finger around the victim’s exposed penis in a circular motion for some time. The offender left the room and returned shortly and performed fellatio on the victim’s exposed penis for a few seconds. He subsequently left the room and returned again to perform fellatio on the victim. He was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane for the charge under s 354(2) of the Penal Code. In addition, he was given a sentence of 12 years imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for each charge punishable under s 376(4)(b) of the Penal Code. The global sentence was 14 years imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane, with the sentence for the charge under s 354(2) of the Penal Code and one charge under s 376 of the Penal Code ordered to run consecutively.</a></p><a id="p1_62"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a><a id="p1_63">63&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the submissions of the Prosecution that the current case bears similarities to <b><em>BNO</em></b> with respect to the victim's age and the extent of betrayal of trust. In both instances, the perpetrator took advantage of his position as a trusted adult and violated the trust of the victim's caretakers. I find that the level of sexual exploitation for the outrage of modesty charge is comparable to the present case. Therefore, a just sentence for the first charge would be 24 months imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane.</a></p><a id="p1_63"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">One transaction rule</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a><a id="p1_64">64&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, I am mindful that the offences were committed against the same victim within a short period of time. The common law principle known as the "one transaction rule" would generally be applicable. This rule states that if multiple offences are committed in a single transaction, the sentences for those offences should be concurrent instead of consecutive. The one transaction rule ensures that an offender is punished proportionately to the gravity of the most serious offence committed and prevents the offender from receiving multiple punishments for the same criminal conduct. This is however subject to section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code which states:</a></p><a id="p1_64"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>307.</b>— (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to subsection&nbsp;(2), if at one trial a person is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for at least 3 distinct offences, the court before which the person is convicted must order the sentences for at least 2 of those offences to run consecutively.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a><a id="p1_65">65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was mindful that common law principles serve as guidance for sentencing courts, whose main responsibility is to determine the appropriate sentence that would best serve the interests of justice. No single factor can definitively establish the appropriate sentence, and in determining it, the court must weigh various considerations. One of these factors is whether the total sentence imposed is proportionate to the inherent gravity of all the offences committed by the accused. Therefore, while a specific sentence for an individual offence may be suitable, the combined effect of the sentences may result in a term of imprisonment that is disproportionate to the accused's overall criminal conduct.</a></p><a id="p1_65"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Totality principle</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a><a id="p1_66">66&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this final stage of the analysis, I assessed whether the combined sentence is proportional to the overall criminality of the offences committed by the Accused utilising the totality principle. This principle comprises two aspects: firstly, the court must examine whether the cumulative sentence is significantly higher than the usual level of sentences for the most severe of the individual offences committed. Secondly, the court must consider whether the effect of the cumulative sentence on the offender is oppressive and not consistent with his past record and future prospects. If the court determines that the cumulative sentence is excessive, it may choose to impose a different combination of consecutive sentences or adjust the individual sentences accordingly.

The degree of intrusion was more significant in the first and third charges compared to the second charge. The first charge involved direct skin-to-skin contact with the victim's nipples and vagina, while the third charge involved direct skin-to-skin contact using the Accused’s penis. The second charge pertained to indirect contact, as the Accused did not make direct physical contact with the victim's chest. While the vile act of ejaculating on the victim was utterly degrading and unsanitary, but considering the indirect nature of the contact, I deemed it appropriate to consider a slightly reduced sentence for the second charge when evaluating the individual sentences.</a></p><a id="p1_68"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentence Imposed</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a><a id="p1_69">69&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acts particularised in the first and third charges of this case are comparable to those in <b><em>GBR</em></b>.
