He has appealed against the sentence which I meted out to him. These are the grounds for my decision on his sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_1"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">CHARGE &amp; PRESCRIBED PENALTY:</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution brought a single charge against Mr Goh: MAC 900178/2023. The charge contended that he had organized remote gambling by others between 2-17 July 2022, on an unlicensed online betting website www.gd288.net, by working with his principal, namely one Tan Sing Heng who was known to him as “Jaguar”, to open betting accounts for punters on that said website and settling their betting accounts with his principal and/or his principal’s runners. In total, bets amounting to $34,386.90 were facilitated by him during that stipulated two-week period.</a></p><a id="p1_2"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh’s actions in the charge constitute an offence under s 9(1)(a) of the RGA, which provides for the following penalty: fine of not less than $20,000 and not more than $200,000 <em>or</em> to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years <em>or</em> to both.</a></p><a id="p1_3"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">FACTS:</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pertinent facts for the charge are summarized below.</a></p><a id="p1_4"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 17 July 2022, acting on information received about illegal betting activities, the police raided the accused’s unit. Just as they were doing so, the accused threw his mobile phone out the window as it contained evidence of his illegal betting activities. The police recovered the phone and placed him under arrest. Investigations revealed that the accused had started illegal 4D betting about 7-8 years before, and had become acquainted in that context with one Tan Sing Heng who was known to him as “Jaguar”. Upon the request of the accused, Jaguar had provided him with a betting account with a credit limit of $300 on an illegal betting website.</a></p><a id="p1_5"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime in <b>2020</b>, the accused decided that he wanted to earn agent commissions for illegal 4D bets mustered up by him. Upon his request, Jaguar arranged for him to be provided with an agent account on the illegal betting website www.gd288.net. As his principal, Jaguar assigned the accused with a credit limit of $20,000/- at first. This was subsequently raised, upon the request of the accused, to $30,000/-.</a></p><a id="p1_6"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his agent status, the accused gathered punters to place illegal 4D bets with him. Using his mobile devices, he would open betting accounts on the illegal betting website for his punters and assign credit limits ranging from $50 to $500 to each punter. These punters would then either place their bets directly on their betting accounts assigned by the accused, or communicate their bets to the accused who would then place those bets on their behalf in their assigned betting accounts. A “Big” ticket bet was $1.60, and a “Small” was $0.70. As agent, the accused earned 10% commission on the total value of bets placed. If any bet resulted in a win, he also earned 5% of the winning amount. As agent, the accused would usually settle his punters’ accounts every other week by either collecting the cash due for the bets placed or receive funds transfers from them to his bank account. The accused would then hand the monies due over to Jaguar by either depositing them in the latter’s bank account or physically handing them over to Jaguar’s runner. In total, the accused opened 42 punter accounts as the agent, and he was earning around $4,000/- per month on average as commissions. At the time of his arrest, 30 punters were active.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the charge proceeded on, the prosecution focused only on the two-week period immediately preceding the raid &amp; arrest, and established that the accused had facilitated bets amounting to $34,386.90 during that period.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before me, the accused pleaded guilty to the charge and unequivocally admitted to the Statement of Facts.

The prosecution applied the sentencing framework laid down in <em>Khoo Moy Seen v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27540-SSP.xml')">[2022] SGHC 98</a> (“<em>Khoo Moy Seen</em>”) for offences under s 9(1) of the RGA, and submitted that the harm in this case fell in the low-to-middle end of moderate, and that culpability was medium. The resulting indicative sentencing range was therefore between 9 months to 2 years imprisonment, with 12 months imprisonment being the start point. After appropriate adjustments on account of his being untraced, and his early plea of guilt, a sentence of 8 months imprisonment was arrived at. The prosecution indicated that this was in line with precedents in <em>PP v Loy Jit Chan</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25704-SSP.xml')">[2021] SGMC 9</a>, and <em>PP v Ng Chuan Seng</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24083-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGMC 3</a>. Since the offender had been working as an agent from 2020 and earning about $4,000 per month, the prosecution submitted that the minimum fine of $20,000 ought to be imposed to disgorge his profits.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">MITIGATION:</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In mitigation, the offender simply pleaded for the shortest imprisonment term possible because he was helping his brother run a hawker stall and his brother would be very shorthanded for the period whilst he was serving his sentence. He also sought a two-week deferment of his sentence to settle his personal affairs.</a></p><a id="p1_12"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">REASONS FOR SENTENCE</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the charge proceeded on, the facts, the submissions and the mitigation, I sentenced the offender to 8 months imprisonment and a fine of $20,000 in default 6 weeks imprisonment. These are my reasons:</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_13-p2_">■&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sentencing the present offender for his offence under s 9(1) RGA ought to be done in accordance with the <em>Khoo Moy Seen</em> framework. In that case, Mdm Khoo was herself also an agent earning commissions from mustering up punters to place 4D bets on an illegal betting website. She did so for only about a year, and had only 15 punters under her as agent, and for the two-week period immediately preceding her arrest, had facilitated bets amounting to $12,010.40. Mdm Khoo pleaded guilty and was untraced. In considering the aggregate value of the bets involved, the involvement of a syndicate, and the difficulty of detection because ‘the betting activity was placed on the online sphere’, the court found that the <b>harm</b> caused by Mdm Khoo was in the middle of the low range (see [18]-[19]). As regards culpability, the court noted the clear and conscious decision by Mdm Khoo to act as agent over a prolonged period of a year for personal gain by earning commissions (see [26] and [29]), and that she had secured at least 15 punters who had placed substantial bet values through her and had taken efforts to avoid detection by providing false names for the punter accounts (see [27]), the court thus found her <b>culpability</b> to be ‘at least at the higher end of the low range’ (see [31]).</a></p><a id="p1_13-p2_"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_"></a><a id="p1_13-p2__1">■&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I considered the case against the present offender was more aggravated than Mdm Khoo on all the parameters which the court stipulated had to be considered. In the present case, the period of the offender’s involvement as an agent with his principal in the syndicate was about doubled (i.e. two years plus from 2020 till his arrest in July 2022). The present offender had also mustered up almost triple the number of punters in comparison (i.e. 42 punters in total) and had been earning substantial commissions averaging $4,000/- per month for that much longer period of involvement; the degree of personal benefit was thus significantly higher. The bet values involved were also almost triple the value in comparison (i.e. $34,386.90), and that amount for the two-week period alone would have seen his 10% share in commissions for that month easily rise substantially above the monthly average which he was prepared to admit to; it was also substantially above the increased credit limit which he negotiated with this principal to obtain. The present offender also took efforts to conceal his illegal activities and threw his mobile device out of his window when the police arrived to raid his unit. Like Mdm Khoo, the present offender’s involvement to act as an agent with the illegal betting syndicate was a clear and conscious decision, motivated by personal gain, and he had even sought successfully to raise his agent facility higher by getting a substantial increase of 50% to his credit limit (i.e. from $20,000/- to $30,000/-), stopping his involvement only when the arrest finally took place. It was thus my judgment that the harm and culpability ought to be scaled up on those counts from that which was settled at in Mdm Khoo’s case. After taking all of those matters into account, I determined that the harm in this case was higher and fell in the low-to-middle end of the moderate range, and that culpability was also higher and fell at the middle of the medium range. The resulting applicable indicative sentencing range in the framework was therefore between 9 months to 2 years imprisonment, and I determined that a 12 month imprisonment term in that range was the appropriate approximate starting point given all the factors recounted.</a></p><a id="p1_13-p2__1"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2__1"></a><a id="p1_13-p2__2">■&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step was to consider what appropriate adjustments ought to be made on account of his being untraced, and his early plea of guilt. These undoubtedly deserved a moderation of the sentence in his favour. Nothing else was offered up in mitigation to merit a further reduction. I also considered the outcomes in <em>Khoo Moy Seen</em>, <em>PP v Loy Jit Chan</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25704-SSP.xml')">[2021] SGMC 9</a>, and <em>PP v Ng Chuan Seng</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24083-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGMC 3</a>, and determined that a moderated sentence of 8 months imprisonment was appropriate for the offence given all the circumstances of the offender as he stood before me and those precedents just cited, and so ordered. In accordance with the sentencing framework and those precedents, I also determined that a fine ought to be imposed since it was the admitted position before me that the present offender had derived substantial personal gains from his illegal activities. The fine would have been pegged higher had the Prosecution offered up more material in the facts before me to indicate how much higher above the minimum did he actually gain. As it stood, the minimum fine of $20,000/- was thus imposed to negate the profit motive in such offences, and I so ordered together with a 6 week default term if that fine was not paid. This aggregate result was in line with the submissions tendered by the Prosecution.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">CONCLUSION: </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it would be appropriate to end by acknowledging again the intent being served in punishing such offences with such sentences. Illegal online gambling activities are inherently difficult to detect, and they offer the ever present and easy temptation for punters to indulge uncontrolled in the vice – frequently to their detriment and to those around them. The activity also ploughs substantial funds to illegal syndicates and their pursuits. These are not harmless victimless offences. Given the circumstances of the offender where he had become hooked on the activity himself some 7-8 years prior, it was plainly aggravated that he sought to profit of it himself by deepening his involvement to become an agent for so many others.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sentence was pronounced, the offender was granted the sentence deferment which he sought. During that period, he filed an appeal against sentence instead. Upon a further mention, sentence has been stayed pending the appeal, and he remains on bail pending the appeal.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a></div></content></html>
