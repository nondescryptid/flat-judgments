At about 9.00am, the officers entered the Unit and sighted duty unpaid cigarettes scattered around the unit. At 9.03am, the officers sighted the accused and Nur emerging from a staircase landing outside the Unit and running away. The officers gave chase and detained them. At about 9.18am, customs officers sighted Syafiiy along Pioneer View Rd near 1 Sunview Road. The officers detained Syafiiy and brought all three accused persons back to the Unit.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the presence of the accused, Nur and Syafiiy, the officers conducted a search in the Unit and found a total of 2996 cartons x 160 sticks and 6100 cartons x 200 sticks of assorted brands of duty unpaid cigarettes.

Ann informed the accused that the job involved unpacking of goods and promised to pay the accused $1,000 for every job completed. The accused agreed to the job offer. On 8 December 2022, at around 11.00pm, Ann informed the accused that there was an unpacking job at Ecotech@Sunview, 1 Sunview Road, Singapore and instructed the accused to meet at the location.</a></p><a id="p1_9"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 9 December 2022, at about 3.00am, the accused arrived at Ecotech@Sunview as instructed and met Nur, Syafiiy and two other unknown men for the first time. Ann then created a WhatsApp group chat consisting of Ann, the three accused persons and the two unknown males. In the group chat, Ann informed that a Malaysian lorry would be delivering four different brands of duty unpaid cigarettes to Ecotech@Sunview and provided the breakdown of the quantity and the brand of cigarettes. The accused then became aware that the job involved duty unpaid cigarettes and confirmed the same with the four other persons waiting with him. Nonetheless, the accused continued to wait for the arrival of the Malaysian lorry containing the duty unpaid cigarettes.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly thereafter, a Malaysian lorry driven by Loo arrived and the accused proceeded to unload the duty unpaid cigarettes from the vehicle with the other four persons. The accused, together with the other four persons, transferred the boxes of duty unpaid cigarettes from the lorry to two unidentified vans parked nearby at the loading/unloading bay of Ecotech@Sunview. The two vans were then driven up to the Unit by Syafiiy and the boxes of cigarettes were unloaded into the Unit.</a></p><a id="p1_11"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all the boxes of cigarettes were moved to the Unit at about 8am, Loo left in the lorry while the accused, Nur, Syafiiy and the two unknown persons proceeded to the Unit to unpack and arrange the boxes of cigarettes according to brands as instructed by Ann. Of all the duty unpaid cigarettes seized from the Unit, investigations revealed that Ann had instructed the members of the WhatsApp group, including the accused, to only repack and arrange 2996 cartons x 160 sticks and 4506 cartons x 200 sticks assorted brands of duty unpaid cigarettes (“C1”) in the Unit. At about 9.00am, the accused was in the midst of unpacking C1 when he became aware of the presence of customs officers at the Unit and attempted to flee before he was detained at 9.03am.</a></p><a id="p1_12"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused knew that the excise duty leviable on the seized cigarettes were unpaid at the material time the offences were committed.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The excise duty leviable on C1 weighing a total of 1,501.656 kilogrammes in the charge is $794,185.84.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Breach of basic condition of remission order</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further investigations revealed that the accused, from 11 June 2021 to 20 May 2023, was subjected to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 or 3 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, Rev. Ed. 2014) which remission order is subject to the basic condition under section 50S(1) of the Prisons Act. While the remission order was in effect, the accused had, on 9 December 2022, committed the aforesaid offences and, upon conviction and the imposition of a sentence reflected under section 50S(1)(b) of the Prisons Act, shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition of the remission order. The accused is thereby liable to be punished under section 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 163 days from 9 December 2022 to 20 May 2023 for that offence.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentencing submissions</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Prosecution’s submissions</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prosecution sought a global sentence of 34 to 35 months’ imprisonment with an enhanced sentence of 81 days’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prosecution highlighted the following sentencing considerations in support of their submission of 34 to 35 months’ imprisonment:</a></p><a id="p1_17"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_17-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quantity of duty unpaid cigarettes involved was significant at 1,501.656 kg and the excise duty evaded on these cigarettes was $794,185.84.</a></p><a id="p1_17-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_17-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the accused did not have any management control or profit share in the operations, he was a paid worker who performed the physical role of repacking the duty unpaid cigarettes on the syndicate’s instructions.

Both sentences were run concurrently.

Where the quantity of tobacco was at the highest band of more than 400 kg, the starting point sentencing range would be between 30 to 36 months’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quantity of tobacco in the present case is 1,501.656 kg, almost four times more than the base quantity of more than 400 kg for the highest band in <em>Yap Ah Lai</em>, where the starting point sentencing range would be between 30 to 36 months’ imprisonment. With that large quantity in mind, an indicative starting point sentence would be at the upper end of that range. I am of the view that an indicative starting point sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment is reasonable, taking into consideration the multiple times the tobacco involved in this case is above the base quantity for the aforesaid sentencing range.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused pleaded for a global custodial sentence of 20 to 25 months’ imprisonment.

Nevertheless, considering that the accused was caught red-handed by customs officers and that he had attempted to run away when they arrived at the scene of the crime, the discount to be given for this factor would have to be tempered.</a></p><a id="p1_25"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also have to weigh any discount against the antecedents of the accused. In <em>Yap Ah Lai</em>, it was held that where the prior offence is not a Customs Act offence, “the fact of the offender’s antecedents should rightly be considered within the rubric of general aggravating factors” (at [30]). The antecedents of the accused included drug offences in 2014 and 2018 and voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons in 2018.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a> Weighing the mitigating factors against the antecedents of the accused, I am of the view that a two month discount in this case is reasonable.

In the present case, the prosecution has submitted that the gravity of the offence is moderate as well.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quantity of tobacco involved in the present case is almost four times that for the relevant charge in <em>Mohamad Faizal</em>. Furthermore, as I have pointed out earlier, the quantity of tobacco involved in the present case is almost four times the base of the highest band in <em>Yap Ah Lai</em>. The starting point sentencing range for that band is between 30 to 36 months’ imprisonment. The sentence that I have imposed is 34 months’ imprisonment. In the premises, I am of the view that the prosecution’s submission that the gravity of the fresh offence in this case is moderate, is reasonable.</a></p><a id="p1_31"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the fresh offence was committed in December 2022, about 18 months after the accused was released from prison in June 2021. The remaining remission period of 163 days is about 5 months. Accordingly, the fresh offence was committed after the accused had completed more than two-thirds of his remission period. I also note that the fresh offence is not similar to the original offence. In the circumstances, I am of the view that the rehabilitative prospects of the accused are moderate.</a></p><a id="p1_32"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weighing the gravity of the fresh offence and the rehabilitative prospects of the accused, I agree with the prosecution that the appropriate sentencing band is in the moderate range.

In <em>Mohamad Faizal</em>, the High Court determined an enhanced sentence of 53% of the remission period was appropriate. In that case, the offence was committed just 20 days after the offender’s release from prison.

I found it useful to consider this case, in the absence of any other similar precedents cited by the parties. In the brief grounds therein, it appears that the High Court considered the gravity of the underlying sentence was within the lower end of the moderate band but gave an uplift to the middle of the band, in view of the early re-offending and history of offending.</a></p><a id="p1_35"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, I am of the view that the prosecution’s submission of an enhanced sentence of 50% of the remission period was reasonable, weighing the much higher quantity of tobacco in the present case against the earlier re-offending in <em>Mohamad Faizal’s</em> case. 50% of the remission period amounts to 81 days, based on the remaining remission period of 163 days.</a></p><a id="p1_36"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As 81 days is significantly less than the sentence of 34 months imposed for the underlying offence, there is no further adjustment required to take into consideration the totality principle.
