Their evidence was largely unchallenged by the Defence. The accused who acted in person throughout the trial had few to no questions for the witnesses, even though it was explained to him by the Court that cross-examination was his opportunity to ask questions of the witnesses, particularly if he disagreed with their evidence or had a different version of events that he wished to put forth.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight of the nine vehicles in question were imported a company named 1 Genesis Pte Ltd (“1 Genesis”).

He also testified that the accused had acted on the instructions of the accused to transfer a sum of money that the accused had provided to him, from his personal bank account to the bank account of a company based in the United Kingdom, Easy Drive Ltd (“Easy Drive”), which had supplied the vehicle.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A witness from Penanshin Air that had been engaged to oversee the importation of this vehicle (PW5) and another witness from its parent company Penanshin Shipping Pte Ltd (PW6) also testified that instructions concerning this vehicle imported under PW7’s name were given by the accused.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a> The evidence of PW5, PW6 and PW7 was not challenged by the accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on documents presented in court, all nine vehicles appear to have been purchased from the company Easy Drive. The director of Easy Drive was apparently one Mr Mohammad Asif, whose name appeared in some of the documents bearing the Easy Drive letterhead.

Based on what he had determined to be the actual values of the vehicles imported by the accused were, PW2 explained how he calculated the shortfall in the amount of excise duty and GST on each of the nine vehicles.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 10 statements that were recorded from the accused by PW2, and another Customs investigation officer (PW3) were admitted into evidence.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a> The accused did not raise any issues concerning their admissibility, and while PW2 and PW3 were on the stand he did not have any questions for them concerning the recording of these statements.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the statements, the accused admitted that he had declared lower values of the vehicles that he imported in the hope of paying less taxes. In the first statement that was recorded from him on 22 August 2017, he stated that “<em>I declare the lower price because I hope to pay less taxes. I tried before declaring a higher price and Singapore Customs will just counter-offer a high price. I know if I lower enough then I can get a lower accepted value which is lower than the one I have paid. I can earn more profit that way.</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused was also asked in his statements to provide explanations for the different versions of the invoices and other supporting documents that were found in his laptop, and why these differed from the values declared in the Declarations of Fact. The accused then produced a further set of invoices to the investigation officer and claimed that these represented the actual value of some of the vehicles. The accused claimed in the statements that the invoices and sales contracts that had been forensically retrieved from his laptop were fabrications that he created because he wanted to show them to one ‘Yang Fan’, who he told the investigators was his business investor. In the statements, the accused said that he wanted to deceive Yang Fan into believing that the vehicles cost more than they did.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In court, PW2 explained why he did not think that the additional set of invoices that the accused produced to the investigators during investigations represented the actual value of the vehicles. He also testified that Customs did not have any leads to follow-up on the person of Yang Fan, as they had been informed by the accused that Yang Fan was in the UK and uncontactable.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution contended that the same incorrect information as to the CIF value in the submissions to Customs were transmitted to the LTA, which then calculated the ARF chargeable on each vehicle.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An officer from the Land Transport Authority (LTA) Vehicle Quota and Registration Division (PW8) gave evidence on how the ARF chargeable on each vehicle is calculated based on the declared open market value of the vehicle. PW8 explained that LTA obtained the information about the declared open market value from Customs, which information was transmitted from Customs to LTA via an external interface twice daily. PW8 also explained that LTA would round up the value obtained from Customs to the nearest dollar before calculating the ARF that is payable. <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW8 also gave evidence on how the ARF for each of the nine vehicles that form the subject matter of the charges against the accused was calculated, including offsets of rebates that some of the vehicles were entitled to under the Carbon Emission-based Vehicles Scheme (CEVS).<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Close of the Prosecution’s case</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence did not make any submission of no case to answer at the close of the Prosecution’s case.

He also testified that he had a friend from the UK, one Yang Fan, who was supposed to be in the business of car importation with him. He claimed that Yang Fan’s father had apparently given him a large sum of money, but before Yang Fan could even go into business with the accused, Yang Fan spent all the money. To appease his father, Yang Fan apparently claimed that he had placed the money in Singapore and in his bid to help his friend, the accused prepared an “IOU” letter stating that 1 Genesis owed money to Yang Fan, which Yang Fan could show his father. The accused claimed that this “IOU” letter had been seized by the Customs investigators, along with some Chinese contraband cigarettes, which he said was proof of Yang Fan’s existence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the accused indicated that he had finished giving his evidence, but the Prosecution suggested that he be given the benefit of additional time to consider what he wished to say, given that he was acting in person. The accused was given about 3.5 hours before resuming his evidence. It was also explained to the accused that his examination-in-chief was his opportunity to provide his version of events and why he was not admitting to the charges.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he returned to the stand to resume his evidence, the accused testified that he had not actually submitted any papers that the vehicles he imported had been deregistered in the country of export, which he said was a breach of the importation procedures in the first place. He said that he did not know if the vehicles had in fact been deregistered and thought that he may have been able to purchase them cheaply because they had not been deregistered. As a result of this impropriety in the importation process, the accused said that there should not have been a case against him since the cars ought not to have been imported in the first place.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused also raised certain allegations about the recording of the statements by the Customs investigation officers. He first claimed that the statements did not fully capture all that had been said between him and the investigators, and that the investigator had tried to “<em>trick</em>” him and pressured him into putting in a statement.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a> The Prosecution objected to this line of evidence on the basis that the accused had not raised any of these allegations when PW2 and PW3 were on the stand, and he should thus not be allowed to belatedly raise these allegations. This objection was explained to the accused, and he did not pursue this line of evidence any further, though he later revisited some of these allegations in his closing submissions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his written closing and reply submissions, the accused reiterated the points that he previously made about the deregistration status of the vehicles in the UK, and about his friend Yang Fan. He also elaborated on his allegations against the Customs investigators, particularly the recorder of his statement on 22 August 2017. He claimed that PW2, the recorder of the statement, placed him under pressure during the recording and forced him into the confession that he made.

It was obvious that these documents provided by the accused to support the DOF and additional values were the erroneous documents, since they did not match the details of the vehicles in other documents such as the bills of lading or the vehicle registration documents.</a></p><a id="p1_36"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A set of communications between the accused and officers of the Tariffs and Trade Services Branch of the Singapore Customs was particularly telling of how the accused was prepared to play fast and loose in generating and submitting documents to Customs, as well as his tendency for his documents to contain errors.

The invoices that were retrieved from the laptop were also in PDF version. These were features of a document that one would expect to receive in a legitimate commercial transaction. Where there were no corresponding invoices retrieved from the accused’s laptop, PW2 explained how the sales contract, fund transfers and WhatsApp messages with ‘Asif’ were indicative of the actual amounts that were paid to Easy Drive for the vehicles.</a></p><a id="p1_43"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a><a id="p1_44">44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the explanations that the accused provided were lacking in logic and internal consistency. It should be noted that the accused did not fully flesh out these explanations in his cross-examination of the Prosecution’s witnesses or in his own testimony as a witness. That said, I was prepared to give him some leeway given that he was acting without the benefit of counsel and considered the explanations that he proffered in his defence during the recording of his statements.</a></p><a id="p1_44"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a><a id="p1_45">45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Central to the accused’s version of events was a person called Yang Fan. The accused was not able to produce any information about Yang Fan that enabled the investigators to contact him, and Yang Fan was not produced as a witness in this trial, though the accused indicated in his testimony that a document seized by Customs authorities and some contraband cigarettes from China are indicators that there is indeed such a person. Ultimately, none of this was placed before the court, and thus all that was before me was a bare assertion by the accused as to his existence.</a></p><a id="p1_45"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a><a id="p1_46">46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even on the assumption that Yang Fan was indeed an actual person, the accused was not able to keep an internally consistent account as to who he was, his involvement with 1 Genesis, and why the accused was fabricating invoices. In his statements to the investigators, he said that he had created invoices to deceive Yang Fan, who he said was his investor, into believing that the vehicles cost more than they did.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a> In court, he claimed that Yang Fan was “<em>supposed to be in this business</em>” with him, but that he had spent the sum of money that his father had given him “<em>before he even started this business</em>” with the accused.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47">47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking these considerations together, I found the accused’s claims regarding Yang Fan and his creation of the documents to be lacking in credibility and accordingly I rejected his version of events involving Yang Fan.</a></p><a id="p1_47"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a><a id="p1_48">48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to his claims in relation to Yang Fan, the accused raised two other arguments in connection with the actual values of the vehicles:</a></p><a id="p1_48"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48"></a><a id="p1_48-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his evidence, the accused claimed that the vehicles had not in fact been deregistered in the UK and that this may have been a reason why he was able to bring the vehicles into Singapore at a cheap price. In his closing submissions, he annexed a set of documents that he said indicate that the vehicles were in fact still registered in the UK.</a></p><a id="p1_48-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_48-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a further set of written submissions, the accused made another claim that the retrieved values of the vehicles were higher than the ‘Recommended Retail Price’ taken from a publicly listed website.</a></p><a id="p1_48-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_49">49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I gathered the accused was trying to establish with these arguments was the existence of other fair and reasonable valuations of the vehicles. Putting aside the fact that none of these points were seriously pursued with the Customs officers who came to testify in court, I could not see how any of these points assisted the accused in his defence.</a></p><a id="p1_49"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a><a id="p1_50">50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of the actual value of the vehicles is essentially a question of what the transaction value of the vehicles is, <em>i.e.</em> what had actually been paid by the importer for the vehicles. By suggesting that the price of the vehicles may have been affected by a failure to have them deregistered in the UK, or that the Customs approved values were higher than the Recommended Retail Price did not ultimately assist me in determining what the actual values of the vehicles were.</a></p><a id="p1_50"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a><a id="p1_51">51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I was satisfied that the retrieved values represented the actual values of the vehicles. Given that the sources of the retrieved values were the accused’s laptop and messages on his phone, I was also satisfied that the accused knew that the retrieved values represented the actual values of the vehicles.</a></p><a id="p1_51"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the accused fraudulently or incorrectly declare the CIF values of the vehicles?</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a><a id="p1_52">52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I deal with the question of whether the accused had fraudulently or incorrectly declared the CIF values of the vehicles.</a></p><a id="p1_52"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a><a id="p1_53">53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I first recap some of the undisputed facts concerning the accused’s direct involvement in the declarations of the vehicles’ values:</a></p><a id="p1_53"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53"></a><a id="p1_53-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused was the sole director and shareholder of 1 Genesis, the company named as the importer of eight of the nine vehicles in question.

The accused was in effect also the importer for this vehicle.</a></p><a id="p1_53-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_54">54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I had noted earlier, there was no dispute that the DOF values were not the actual values of the vehicles. It was therefore clear to me that the accused was, at the very least, the source of the incorrectly declared values of the vehicles in the Declaration of Facts.</a></p><a id="p1_54"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a><a id="p1_55">55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the charges framed by the Prosecution specified the fraudulent or incorrect declaration of the CIF values as the declaration made when the cargo clearance permit is obtained, and not the Declaration of Facts. The values that were submitted for this purpose were the Customs approved values. The Defence’s position was that there was no false declaration because the Customs approved values, having been evaluated and approved by Customs, could not be fraudulent or incorrect.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a> In other words, if all the accused had done was to submit a value that Customs had deemed to be an acceptable value of the vehicle, then it could not be said that the accused had fraudulently or incorrectly declared the values of the vehicles to Customs.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56">56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution’s position was that while Customs did carry out an assessment of the information and materials submitted by an importer, the assessment was premised on the accuracy of the information provided by the importer. Thus, if inaccurate or false information had been provided to Customs, the false information would taint the outcome of the assessment. In that sense, the value derived from Customs’ assessment cannot be considered the correct value of the vehicle. It argued that the accused should not be allowed to hide behind the fact that Customs conducted its own assessment of the value of the vehicle to sidestep the fact that he had provided the incorrect values that formed the basis of that assessment.</a></p><a id="p1_56"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a><a id="p1_57">57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the Defence’s argument – while having a gloss of logic at first blush – could not stand. The accused in submitting the Customs approved values was not innocently relying on these values, in the sense that he did so knowing full well that the provenance of the Customs approved values were the incorrect information and materials that had been submitted when the Declaration of Facts was submitted for each vehicle. In the accused’s words as recorded in his statement of 11 September 2017, “<em>I know I can declare a low value to make sure their proposed value will be lower than the one I have paid.</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58">58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also made clear in his statements that the reason that he declared a lower value than what he had actually paid was to pay less taxes, and thereby improve his own profit margin.</a></p><a id="p1_58"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a><a id="p1_59">59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taken together, I cannot see how the accused’s submissions of the Customs approved values can be considered correct or honest. They were plainly incorrect – because they were premised on incorrect information that the accused himself had first provided to Customs.

While Counsel readily acknowledged that <em>Chelsea Tan</em> was concerned with offences where the court had the ability to consider both sentences of fines and imprisonment terms, whereas under section 128L(2) of the Customs Act, there was no option for a sentence of imprisonment, he argued that the principles discussed in <em>Chelsea Tan</em> could be extrapolated and applied in the present case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80">80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the quantum of the fine that should be imposed, the Defence accepted the Prosecution’s position that an uplift from the multiplier of 10 times the amount of excise duty and GST evaded that was applied in <em>Vida Ang</em> would be appropriate but argued that a multiplier of 12 times instead of 15 times would suffice.

The accused carried out a scheme to under-declare the values of vehicles for importation that involved the fabrication of supporting documents to falsely represent to Customs and LTA the actual value of the vehicles. All this was done with a view to paying less excise duties, GST and ARF for the vehicles.</a></p><a id="p1_81"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a><a id="p1_82">82&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, while clearly premeditated and blatant, the scheme was not particularly sophisticated. As a comparison, the offender in <em>Vida Ang</em> used three different methods to under-declare the value of his imported vehicles, by enlisting the assistance of his exporters to either split the invoice for each vehicle into two or issue an invoice for a lesser amount than the actual price. The accused in this case did not employ a scheme of quite the same level of complexity. There is no indication that he had enlisted the assistance of the exporter in this case, but instead chose to fabricate the invoices on his own. As I had indicated in my trial findings, those fabricated invoices contained many errors and were not particularly convincing documents.</a></p><a id="p1_82"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a><a id="p1_83">83&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the offender-specific factors, I agreed with the Defence that some of the factors that the Prosecution had raised in their submissions ought not to be considered as aggravating factors. These were:</a></p><a id="p1_83"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83"></a><a id="p1_83-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the accused had elected to claim trial. While I accepted that the manner an accused conducts his defence can be considered an aggravating factor, I did not think this was a consideration that was engaged in the present case. The trial itself had not been unnecessarily prolonged by the accused, and the only time he sought adjournments was for time to engage counsel for mitigation and sentencing. The lack of a guilty plea meant that he could not expect any discount to the sentence that he might have otherwise received, but it was not an aggravating factor that weighed against him.</a></p><a id="p1_83-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_83-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lack of restitution by the accused. Had the accused made restitution to the authorities, this might have been considered a mitigating factor to his credit. However, the failure to do so, in my view ought to be considered a neutral factor.</a></p><a id="p1_83-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_83-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused’s antecedents for Moneylender Act offences. As these antecedents were dissimilar to the offences at hand, I did not think that they ought to weigh significantly against him as an offender-specific factor.</a></p><a id="p1_83-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_84">84&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the issue of the accused’s impecuniosity, I was prepared to accept that the accused was indeed not in a financial position to pay any fines imposed due to his bankruptcy. The case of <em>Chelsea Tan</em> that the Defence had cited in support of its arguments on this front was concerned with a situation where a court might impose a custodial sentence where a fine would otherwise be appropriate due to the impecuniosity of the offender, but that position must be premised on the court being able to impose a sentence of a fine or imprisonment. In contrast, most of the charges of concern in this case were punishable under section 128L(2) of the Customs Act, which provides only for a punishment of fine. I could not agree with the Defence’s extrapolation of the High Court’s decision in <em>Chelsea Tan</em> to justify a reduction in the quantum of the fine to be imposed on these charges.</a></p><a id="p1_84"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a><a id="p1_85">85&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, I was conscious that the purpose of an in-default term of imprisonment is to deter the non-payment of fines, as opposed to being the punishment for an offence itself: <em>Chelsea Tan</em> at [21]. As such, I did give some consideration to the accused’s lack of financial ability to pay the fine in determining the in-default imprisonment terms to be imposed.</a></p><a id="p1_85"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Customs Act charges</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a><a id="p1_86">86&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking these factors into consideration, I was of the view that while some uplift from the 10 times multiplier that had been applied by the court in <em>Vida Ang</em> was appropriate, considering that the offender in <em>Vida Ang</em> had pleaded guilty. However, apart from this distinguishing factor, I did not think that the present case was so much more aggravated that justified a 15 times multiplier, which the Prosecution had sought. In my view, a 12 times multiplier of the excise duties and GST amounts evaded was the appropriate quantum of fines to be imposed for the offences punishable under section 128L(2) of the Customs Act.</a></p><a id="p1_86"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a><a id="p1_87">87&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the in-default imprisonment terms to be imposed for each of the fines, the Prosecution had cited the case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Ho Chee Wai</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26506-SSP.xml')">[2021] SGDC 174</a> (“<em>Ho Chee Wai</em>”) as a reference point for the calibration of the in-default terms. <em>Ho Chee Wai</em> similarly involved offences punishable under section 128L(2) of the Customs Act, where the offender was sentenced to a global fine of $340,776.60. The Prosecution in that case had proposed a banded approach to converting fines to default sentences, taking into account that section 119 of the Customs Act provides that the maximum default sentence that can be imposed per charge is 6 years’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88">88&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noted that the District Court in <em>Ho Chee Wai</em> did not expressly endorse the Prosecution’s proposed approach to the calibration of the in-default sentence, and that I was in any event not bound by its decision or approach. I did nevertheless find the suggested approach to be a helpful reference point, and more importantly, a reminder of the need to ensure that the cumulative in-default sentence was not overly crushing.</a></p><a id="p1_88"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a><a id="p1_89">89&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was also of the view that it was appropriate to take into account the time that the accused had spent in remand prior to his conviction, which came up to a period of about 23 weeks. There is ample case precedent for the backdating of imprisonment sentences to take into account periods of remand, though in this case the period of remand was much longer than the imprisonment term that the Prosecution was seeking on the RTA charges and it was not possible for in default imprisonment terms to be backdated. As such, I considered it appropriate to make downward calibrations to the in default terms to be imposed for the charges punishable under section 128L(2) of the Customs Act to account for the time spent in remand.</a></p><a id="p1_89"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a><a id="p1_90">90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution had argued that little to no weight should be given to the remand period in calibrating the sentence to be imposed, as the remand period had arisen out of his abscondment and subsequent arrest, which they argued was qualitatively different from remand periods arising out of an accused who has been offered bail but was not able to be bailed out. No case authority was cited in support of the distinction that they sought to make, and I was not aware of any such authority. I could not see any good reason to disregard or give little weight to the accused’s time in remand, which was substantial. If I had done so, the effect of that would be to punish the accused for his abscondment with the entire period of his remand, which in my view would be disproportionate.</a></p><a id="p1_90"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a><a id="p1_91">91&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I imposed the following fines at a multiplier of 12 times the excise duty or GST evaded, and

clear="left"><br clear="left"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a><a id="p1_92">92&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In writing these grounds of decision, I have noted that I had made an error in respect of the sentence imposed on the charge DAC 922466-2019. Unlike the rest of the charges for the offences under Customs Act in this case, the charges DAC 922466-2019 and DAC 922467-2019 were for offences under section 128(1)(a) Customs Act, which is correspondingly punishable under section 128L(1) of the Customs Act. Section 128L(1) provides for a maximum fine of up to $10,000, or the equivalent of the amount of duty or tax payable. Accordingly, the fine of $18,903 (in default 2 weeks’ imprisonment) that I had imposed in respect of DAC 922466-2019 was in excess of the maximum fine that I had the jurisdiction to impose for this charge, and I invite the appellate court to correct the sentence imposed for this charge.</a></p><a id="p1_92"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">RTA charges</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a><a id="p1_93">93&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the sentences to be imposed on the RTA charges, parties were not far apart in their positions.

In that case, the court had sentenced the offender to 2 weeks’ imprisonment on each proceeded charge under the RTA. The main differences between <em>Vida Ang</em> and the present case were (i) the larger number of charges and amount of ARF avoided in <em>Vida Ang</em> compared to the present case, and (ii) the offender in <em>Vida Ang</em> pleaded guilty, while the accused in this case claimed trial.</a></p><a id="p1_94"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a><a id="p1_95">95&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balancing these factors, I agreed with the Prosecution that a sentence of 2 weeks’ imprisonment per charge, with two of the sentences to run consecutively for a global imprisonment term of 4 weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate.</a></p><a id="p1_95"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a><a id="p1_96">96&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I made an order for the undercharged ARF amounts for the sum of $219,162 under section 11(9) of the RTA.</a></p><a id="p1_96"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a><a id="p1_97">97&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons set out above, the accused was convicted on the charges and sentenced to 4 weeks’ imprisonment, a fine of $465,033.96 (in default 30 weeks’ imprisonment).
