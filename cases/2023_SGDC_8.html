She was intellectually disabled and epileptic. At the time of the offences, D was a volunteer worker with MINDS, a voluntary welfare organisation which works with persons with intellectual disabilities.</a></p><a id="p1_4"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to his arrest, the accused was living together with his wife (D’s mother) and D at [address redacted], Singapore (“the Flat”). The accused was aged 57 to 58 years old and D was aged 24 to 25 years old at the time of the offences.</a></p><a id="p1_5"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background facts</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D was born out of wedlock and grew up in [country redacted] in the care of her maternal grandmother. D’s natural parents married one another in 2002. D met the accused for the first time in around 2008, when she was about 14 years old. Between 2008 and 2014, D saw the accused about once every two years. D moved to Singapore to be with her parents in April or May 2014, when she was 19 years old.</a></p><a id="p1_6"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime around Chinese New Year in 2019, the accused showed his penis to D and told her to shake and massage it. He did this under the pretext of educating her sexually so that she would not get pregnant by other men. D did as the accused told her and masturbated his penis until he ejaculated.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following that incident, the accused went on to receive acts of fellatio from D on at least four occasions. Most instances began with the accused scolding D for unrelated matters. For instance, because she accidentally broke the accused’s weight set while exercising, or because she brought home a used face mask that she had found outside. D then fellated the accused as a means of apologising to him and in the hopes of appeasing his anger.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acts of fellatio typically occurred in the evening, when the accused’s wife was working. Her working hours at the time were about 3pm to 11pm. All the acts of fellatio occurred on a sofa in the living room of the Flat. The accused often told D not to tell anyone else about the sexual acts, including the victim’s mother.</a></p><a id="p1_9"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Facts relating to the 1<sup>st</sup> charge (DAC-915465-2021)</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime in March or April 2019, D was chatting to the accused in the Flat and shared that she was physically attracted to members of a Korean boy band. In the course of this conversation, the accused grew sexually aroused and was tempted to engage in sexual acts with the victim.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused showed pornographic videos to D on his tablet and told her that this was how people engaged in sexual acts. Afterwards, the accused asked D to remove his pants. As she was too shy, he removed his pants himself. The accused then asked D to masturbate his penis by massaging it, and D reluctantly complied.</a></p><a id="p1_11"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused was emboldened by the victim’s compliance and asked her to suck his penis. The accused said that he was teaching her so that she could get experience in sexual matters, and that if she serviced other men outside, they might harm her instead. D complied and fellated the accused until he ejaculated.</a></p><a id="p1_12"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of this offence, the accused was 57 years old and D was 24 years old.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Facts relating to the 4<sup>th</sup> charge (DAC-915468-2021)</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final incident of fellatio between the accused and D occurred in early April 2020. One morning, the accused and D were eating together in the Flat when D dipped her own spoon into a dish of food instead of using the serving spoon. The accused became furious and shouted at D about her lack of hygiene. Out of anger, he refused to talk to her. D felt very sad.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later that day, D went up to the accused and said she was sorry. She sat down close to him on the sofa in their living room and looked at his groin. The accused inferred that she was offering to fellate him. The accused therefore pulled down his pants. D told the accused, “hey papa, I think you need to wash first, it’s quite smelly”.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused went to wash his groin and came back. D then fellated the accused until he ejaculated onto his stomach. Thereafter, the accused told D that she did a good job. He reminded her not to mention the incident to anyone else and to keep it a secret.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of this offence, the accused was 57 years old and D was 25 years old.</a></p><a id="p1_17"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Discovery of the offences</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D disliked fellating her father and felt that he was asking her to do this more and more frequently. Sometime after the final incident of fellatio, D eventually confided in her training officer at MINDS that her father had been asking her to suck his penis.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 6 April 2020 at 5.45pm, D, accompanied by a case worker from MINDS lodged a report at [location redacted] Neighbourhood Police Post, stating that she had been sexually assaulted by the accused.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the matter came to the attention of the Police, D was brought to stay at a home for disabled persons, where she continues residing to date.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Neurological and psychiatric assessments for D</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2008, at the age of 14, D was assessed by the National Neuroscience Institute. She was suspected to have subtle cortical dysplasia and polymicrogyria at part of her left frontal lobe.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2015, at the age of 20, D was seen at the NUS Clinical and Health Psychology Centre. According to a psychological report dated 13 March 2015, intellectual assessment on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale – Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV) suggested that D was functioning in the extremely low range of intelligence. Her verbal comprehension index, working memory index and processing speed index were all in the extremely low range, while her perceptual reasoning index was in the borderline range. On the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales – Second Edition (Vineland-II), D’s overall level of adaptive functioning was found to be within the low range.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the discovery of the offences, D was assessed by Dr Nisha Chandwani (“Dr Chandwani”) at the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) on 12 August 2020 and 11 November 2020. Dr Chandwani assessed D to be suffering from intellectual disability. Her current functioning was in keeping with that expected from her level of intellectual disability. In Dr Chandwani’s view, D’s intellectual disability did not impair her judgment at the time of the offences. She understood that her father’s action was not right, but she was unable to refuse his advances out of fear of incurring her parents’ anger and punishments.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chandwani issued a clarification report dated 13 April 2021 stating that:</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_24-p2_a">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D was able to understand the nature and consequence of the sexual acts she performed on her father, notwithstanding her intellectual disability.</a></p><a id="p1_24-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_24-p2_b">b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victim’s intellectual disability did not impair her ability to make a proper judgement in the giving of consent to sexual touching.</a></p><a id="p1_24-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chandwani issued a further clarification report dated 5 Sep 2022 stating the following:</a></p><a id="p1_25"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_25-p2_a">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D’s intellectual disability rendered her dependent on others.

The accused was diagnosed with major depressive disorder with anxious distress, which was unlikely to be in a state of relapse at and around the time of the offences. This was likely to be in a state of relapse after the accused’s arrest. Dr Tay also opined that there was no contributory link between the accused’s mental health condition and the commission of the offences. Dr Tay assessed that the accused’s risk of reoffending was likely to be low.</a></p><a id="p1_26"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Antecedents</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused was untraced.</a></p><a id="p1_27"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prosecution’s submission on sentence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution submitted for the following sentences:</a></p><a id="p1_28"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28"></a><a id="p1_28-p2_a">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 1st charge: 3 to 3½ years’ imprisonment; and</a></p><a id="p1_28-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_28-p2_b">b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the enhanced 4<sup>th</sup> charge: 4 to 4½ years’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_28-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution submitted for both sentences to run consecutively, leading to a global sentence of 7 to 8 year’s imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_29"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution submitted that a sentencing framework for an offence of incest under s 376G Penal Code was unnecessary as there were few cases of incest prosecuted and hence any sentencing framework would be of limited utility.</a></p><a id="p1_30"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, the Prosecution submitted that the present case fell at the higher end of the spectrum of gravity for offences of incest from the presence of the following four aggravating factors.</a></p><a id="p1_31"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, abuse of trust. The accused was D’s biological father and had a duty to protect and care for her. At the time of the offences, D’s mother was away from home for most of the afternoon and night due to her long working hours, thus giving the accused primary care for D (and unsupervised access to her) for lengthy periods of time. He abused this position of trust and parental responsibility by exploiting D for his sexual gratification. To make matters worse, D was abused in the privacy and sanctity of her own home, which ought to have been a safe haven sheltering her from the dangers of the outside world.</a></p><a id="p1_32"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, D’s vulnerability. According to the NUS Clinical and Health Psychology Centre 2015 report, D was functioning in the extremely low range of intelligence. In 2020, IMH also assessed D to be intellectually disabled. D’s simple-mindedness was also illustrated by the fact that she once innocently brought home a used face mask that she had found outside, which was the catalyst for one of the offences. D’s mental capacity and lack of maturity would have made her susceptible to be sexually exploited by her father, who was aware that she was intellectually disabled.</a></p><a id="p1_33"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, sexual grooming. The accused escalated his sexual acts with D over time and under the pretext of educating her in sexual matters. He started by getting her to shake and massage his penis around Chinese New Year in 2019. Emboldened by her compliance, he began getting her to not only masturbate but also fellate him. He showed her pornographic videos and self-servingly claimed to be protecting her from servicing other men outside who might harm her. The Prosecution submitted that it was especially perverse that the accused interwove the sexual acts into his parental role as a disciplinarian. By the time of the final incident, D had already internalised the fellatio to such an extent that she did not think twice about fellating her father when he was angry at her for misbehaving. The accused reinforced and normalised this state of affairs by praising D after she fellated him. He also took steps to prevent his offences from coming to light by coaching D not to disclose these acts to anyone else, including her mother.</a></p><a id="p1_34"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, the multiplicity of offences. Besides the two proceeded charges, the accused also committed two other acts of incest (the subject of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and the enhanced 3<sup>rd</sup> charge), which are being taken into consideration for sentencing. The accused thus subjected D to not one but a series of abusive acts, over the course of about a year, and these additional offences warranted an increase in the sentence, see <em>Ng Kean Meng Terence v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20745-SSP.xml')">[2017] 2 SLR 449</a> <em>(“Ng Kean Meng Terence v PP”)</em> at [64(a)].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By reason of these four aggravating factors, the Prosecution submitted that the present case ranked highly in the spectrum of severity for cases which may be prosecuted under s 376G Penal Code. The sentence imposed should thus fall at the higher end of the five-year sentencing range. The Prosecution accepted that the accused was genuinely remorseful and that some sentencing discount should be given for his decision to plead guilty, thus sparing D from the ordeal of testifying.</a></p><a id="p1_36"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, in so far as the enhanced 4<sup>th</sup> charge was concerned, the enhanced maximum sentencing range afforded to this Court should result in an increase in the sentence meted out for that charge. Where Parliament has increased the maximum sentence, that typically means that sentences should increase too, as this signifies that “Parliament viewed the offence as more serious and therefore requiring stiffer punishments in line with current societal trends and circumstances”, see <em>PP v Lam Leng Hung</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20792-SSP.xml')">[2017] 4 SLR 474</a> at [387]; <em>Mehra Radhika v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16789-SSP.xml')">[2015] 1 SLR 96</a> at [27].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the enhanced 4<sup>th</sup> charge would represent multiple instances of reoffending by the accused as compared to the first charge, which was the first known instance he had committed the offence.

The Defence disagreed with the Prosecution that abuse of trust was an aggravating factor aggravating factor was conceptually incongruous with an offence of incest. The Defence contended that while abuse of trust was a relevant factor for cases where sexual conduct was forced upon an individual against one’s will or cases which involved a vulnerable victim where consent is not relevant, this factor did not apply in an offence where two adults had given consent to perform sexual acts on each other.

The Defence also highlighted that since 1 January 2020, section 376G Penal Code had been amended to state at section 376G(4) Penal Code that non-consensual acts of penetration which would constitute an offence under section 375(1)(<em>a</em>), 375(1A)(<em>a</em>), 376(1)(<em>a</em>) or (2) or 376AA(1) Penal Code would be excluded from acts of penetration as defined under section 376G(1) Penal Code.

The count of incest involved penile-vaginal penetration. As such, the indicative starting point was likely to fall in Band 2.

The daughter was vulnerable in that she was 21 years old and was of borderline intelligence. The Defence submitted that <em>Hoe Chiew Kwee</em> clearly crossed the threshold to Band 3 because of the extent of degradation inflicted on his daughter and the intensity of the aggravating factors of (a) the victim was a vulnerable victim; (b) the use of blackmail on the victim and (c) the use of money to incentivise the victim to perform sexual intercourse, (d) the degradation inflicted on the victim such as the “<em>shocking pornographic photographs taken of his daughter for his enjoyment</em>”.</a></p><a id="p1_63"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a><a id="p1_64">64&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying the Defence’s proposed sentencing framework to the present case, the Defence submitted that an appropriate starting point for the 1<sup>st</sup> and enhanced 4<sup>th</sup> Charge would be 12 months and 18 months imprisonment respectively.</a></p><a id="p1_64"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a><a id="p1_65">65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taken into account offender specific factors including the TIC charges and the accused plea of guilt, the Defence submitted that a custodial sentence of 15 months should be imposed for the 1<sup>st</sup> Charge and 21 months’ imprisonment for the enhanced 4<sup>th</sup> Charge which would account for the uplift required under Section 74A (2) of the Penal Code with the sentences for both charges to be run consecutively, leading to a global sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_65"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The court’s decision on sentence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a><a id="p1_66">66&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 376G Penal Code has gone through various legislative iterations and the version of section 376G Penal Code which was repealed and re-enacted vide the Criminal Law Reform Act 2019 with effect from 1 January 2020 applied to the enhanced 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> charges where the offences took place in February and April 2020 respectively.</a></p><a id="p1_66"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a><a id="p1_67">67&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, with regard to the punishment provided for the offence, the versions of section 376G Penal Code before and after 1 January 2020 which were applicable to all the charges in the present case carried a mandatory imprisonment term of up to five years.

The Prosecution submitted that a sentencing framework was unnecessary as there were few cases of incest prosecuted and hence any sentencing framework would be of limited utility. As a first instance court, I did not think it was appropriate for me to adopt a sentencing framework for the offence of incest under section 376G Penal Code, as an appellate court would be better placed should it wish to do so, which would include deciding what type of sentencing framework was appropriate for an offence under section 376G Penal Code and the allocation of appropriate sentencing ranges to each band or box, as the case may be.</a></p><a id="p1_68"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a><a id="p1_69">69&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, in arriving at the appropriate sentence for the present case, I considered what, in my view, were the relevant offence and offender specific factors in this case, but I first considered the relevance of the UK Sentencing Guideline for an offence of incest.</a></p><a id="p1_69"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The relevance of the UK Sentencing Guideline</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a><a id="p1_70">70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence had submitted that only the offence-specific factors cited by the UK Sentencing Guideline for an offence of incest under section 64 of the UK Sexual Offences Act 2003 should be relevant to an offence of incest under section 376G Penal Code. I disagreed with this limitation for the following reasons.</a></p><a id="p1_70"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a><a id="p1_71">71&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, section 64 of the UK Sexual Offences Act 2003 was substantially different from section 376G Penal Code. Section 64(2) of the UK Sexual Offences Act 2003 stated that the ways in which the parties may be related for an offence of an incest are “parent, grandparent, child, grandchild, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, uncle, aunt, nephew or nephew”. This can be contrasted with section 376G Penal Code which defines a close family relative as “grandchild, child, sibling, half-sibling, parent or grandparent”. As can be seen, the UK definition of a “relative” UK was wider than Singapore and included an uncle, aunt, nephew and niece which was not included in section 376G Penal Code.</a></p><a id="p1_71"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a><a id="p1_72">72&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the punishment provisions for an offence of incest in the UK and Singapore was <em>significantly different</em> in that in the UK, the sentencing options included a fine, community based sentences and a maximum of two years’ imprisonment whereas section 376G Penal Code carried with it only a mandatory imprisonment term of up to 5 years with no option for a fine or a community based sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_72"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a><a id="p1_73">73&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, our courts have, in other case involving sexual offences, set out offence-specific factors beyond those which was stated in the UK Sentencing Guideline (see, for example <em>GBR</em> which refers to an abuse of a position of trust at [29(c)]) and I saw no reason why those factors could not be appropriately applied to an offence of incest.</a></p><a id="p1_73"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a><a id="p1_74">74&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, these material differences between the law of incest in the UK and Singapore underscore Menon CJ’s cautionary observation in <em>Chan Chun Hong v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18991-SSP.xml')">[2016] 3 SLR 465</a> at [87]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The policy considerations that are relevant to a Singapore court for a particular offence may well differ from those affecting a court in a foreign jurisdiction given the unique social mores that undergird each society.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75">75&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following from this, I did not find the UK case of <em>R v Robert Lee Cole</em> [2020] EWCA Crim 818 (“<em>Robert Lee Cole”</em>) and the sentence passed therein as helpful in considering the appropriate sentence in the present case.</a></p><a id="p1_75"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Offence specific factors </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a><a id="p1_76">76&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of offender specific factors, I found the following factors relevant in the present case.</a></p><a id="p1_76"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Grooming</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a><a id="p1_77">77&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution submitted that there was sexual grooming in that the accused had escalated his sexual acts with D over time under the pretext of educating her in sexual matters. The Defence submitted that this was not a relevant factor as grooming was a specific offence under s 376EA Penal Code and was only applicable to victims between the age of 16 to 18 and not to adults such as D who was 24 to 25 years old at the material time. On this point, I made the following observations.</a></p><a id="p1_77"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a><a id="p1_78">78&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there was no requirement that an offence specific factor needs to amount to an offence before it can be regarded as an offence-specific factor.</a></p><a id="p1_78"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a><a id="p1_79">79&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, one of the UK Sentencing Council’s Guidelines had a factor referred to as “grooming behaviour towards the victim”. As such, grooming in the UK was recognized as an offence specific factor for an offence of incest with <em>an adult relative</em> under section 64 of the UK Sexual Offences Act 2003 and there was no restriction to it being confined to cases involving minors. In <em>Robert Lee Cole</em> the UK Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court’s decision to find that there was grooming behaviour of the victim who was 19 years old at that time, noting at [13] as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_79"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">There were incidents of praise, of secret messaging between the two and there was talk of buying an engagement ring.

Where the Prosecution has proved relevant facts, we do not see why the court should pay no heed to them when considering the appropriate sentence on the sole ground that they might also amount to offences. <b>We think it is important to consider the totality of the circumstances of a charged offence in order to have a true flavour of the offence as the overall perspective may have an impact on the level of the offender’s culpability and the extent of the victim’s suffering.</b> Naturally, in applying this principle, the court must take a common-sense and contextual approach when considering the importance of the proved relevant facts.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81">81&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While <em>Bong Sim Swan Suzanna</em> dealt with the specific question of whether a court should disregard facts which may amount to a separate offence which the offender was not charged with, in my respectful view, it also stood for the general proposition that a sentencing court must consider the totality of the circumstances of a charged offence in order to have a true flavour of the offence.</a></p><a id="p1_81"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a><a id="p1_82">82&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, it would be artificial to disregard the accused’s conduct in the lead up to the offences of incest in assessing the culpability of the accused.</a></p><a id="p1_82"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a><a id="p1_83">83&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, a summary of the grooming behaviour as recounted in the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) in the present case was as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_83"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83"></a><a id="p1_83-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around Chinese New Year in 2019, the accused showed his penis to D and told her to shake and massage it.

In this regard, I agree with the Prosecution’s submission that as the accused was D’s biological father that imputed a duty to protect and care for her. He abused this relationship by purporting to educate her in sexual matters and then exploiting her for his own sexual gratification. I would add that it was Dr Chandwani’s view that given D’s intellectual disability, this rendered her dependent on others.

In so far as there were unreported precedents, it is well established that a sentencing court should approach such unreported precedents with caution as it may not be possible to discern what had weighed on the mind of the sentencing judge in those cases, see <em>PP v Mahadi bin Muhamad Mukhtar</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/28748-SSP.xml')">[2022] SGHC 217</a> per Hoong J at [7] and <em>Janardana Jayasankarr</em> per Menon CJ at [13(b)].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109">109&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the facts and scenarios in these cases were quite diverse as the offenders in some of those cases had also been charged with other offences such as rape and outraging of modesty or non-consensual acts of incest which would lead to the individual and/or global sentences being significantly higher. That said, one data point that could be taken from the Prosecution’s precedents was that the sentences for incest ranged from 2 to 5 years’ imprisonment.

The offender paid her $100 for sexual intercourse, as well as photographing her in the nude and removing her pubic hair with a shaver. In his Grounds of Judgment, Amarjeet JC observed at [11] that the offender had sexually exploited and morally corrupted his natural daughter whom he found psychological vulnerable to his advances by having intercourse with her over some six months.</a></p><a id="p1_110"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a><a id="p1_111">111&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amarjeet JC imposed the maximum term of 5 years imprisonment per charge and ordered all three sentences to run consecutively, leading to a global term of 15 years’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_111"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The appropriate sentence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a><a id="p1_112">112&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the dominant sentencing principle for an offence of incest is deterrence. This is evidenced by the fact that Parliament has established a mandatory jail term for an offence of incest, with no option for a fine. This was further exemplified in <em>Hoe Chiew Kee</em> by Amarjeet JC who held at [11] that:</a></p><a id="p1_112"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Society had a special interest in seeing that steps are taken to put a stop to incest which undermines the family unit which is a pillar of society.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a><a id="p1_113">113&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v PP</em> [2006] 4 SLR (R) 653 (“<em>Angliss”</em>) the High Court held at [84] that sentencing judges must take note of the maximum penalty and then apply their minds to determine precisely where the offender’s conduct fell within the spectrum of punishment devised by Parliament.

Amarjeet JC held that “the Accused had sexually exploited and morally corrupted his own natural daughter, who he found psychologically vulnerable to his advances” and he had brought “much dishonour and emotional grief to his daughter, his wife and the other siblings in the family which dishonour and grief will stay with them.” He accordingly imposed the maximum sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment per charge,</a></p><a id="p1_118"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a><a id="p1_119">119&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, given the serious aggravating facts of <em>Hoe Chiew Kee</em>, the individual sentences in the present case should be lower than the maximum term imposed in <em>Hoe Chiew Kee</em>.

As such, the enhanced 4<sup>th</sup> charge’s maximum imprisonment term was doubled from five to 10 years’ imprisonment in view of section 74A(2) Penal Code.</a></p><a id="p1_123"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a><a id="p1_124">124&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, there should be a concomitant uplift from the sentence in the 1<sup>st</sup> charge. That said, the uplift should not be a linear and mathematical uplift as the fact that D’s vulnerability was factored in as an offence-specific factor for the 1<sup>st</sup> charge, but an uplift was nonetheless necessary in view of the higher maximum penalty and the need to determine precisely where the accused’s conduct fell within the spectrum of punishment devised by Parliament, see <em>Angliss</em> at [84]. In the circumstances, I imposed a sentence of 4 years’ imprisonment for the enhanced 4<sup>th</sup> charge.</a></p><a id="p1_124"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a><a id="p1_125">125&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As both offences were committed on separate occasions a year apart and were not part of a single continuous transaction.
