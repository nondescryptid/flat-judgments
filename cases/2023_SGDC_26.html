The three charges were as follows.</a></p><a id="p1_1"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_1-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One charge for failing, without reasonable excuse, to provide a specimen of his urine within such time as was required by a police officer, an offence under s&nbsp;31(2) of the MDA. I will refer to this charge as the “urine charge”.</a></p><a id="p1_1-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_1-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One charge for unauthorised possession of the Class&nbsp;A controlled drug methamphetamine, an offence under s&nbsp;8(<em>a</em>) of the MDA. I will refer to this charge as the “possession charge”.</a></p><a id="p1_1-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_1-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One charge for possession of various utensils intended for the consumption of a controlled drug, an offence under s&nbsp;9 of the MDA. I will refer to this charge as the “utensils charge”.</a></p><a id="p1_1-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused has filed an appeal against conviction, and so I set out now in writing the reasons why I convicted him on the three charges. Given that he has not appealed against the sentence that I imposed after convicting him, I will not set out my written reasons for the sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_2"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, given that the accused has been remanded in custody since 22&nbsp;September 2019 because no one has stood bail for him, I should mention that his global sentence was five years’ and seven months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane, and an enhanced sentence of 196&nbsp;days’ imprisonment imposed pursuant to s&nbsp;50T of the Prisons Act (Cap&nbsp;247, 2000 Rev Ed). The sentences for the individual charges were as follows.</a></p><a id="p1_3"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3"></a><a id="p1_3-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the urine charge, five years’ and three months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane, and an enhanced sentence of 196&nbsp;days’ imprisonment. The accused was liable to be punished under s&nbsp;33A(1) of the MDA for the urine charge because he had two previous convictions for consumption of a specified drug, meaning that it was mandatory to impose a sentence of not less than five years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane.</a></p><a id="p1_3-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_3-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the possession charge, 30&nbsp;months’ imprisonment. The accused was liable for enhanced punishment for the possession charge under s&nbsp;33(1) of the MDA read with the Second Schedule because he had previously been convicted of unauthorised possession of a controlled drug. The minimum sentence was two years’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_3-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_3-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the utensils charge, four months’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_3-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The length of the enhanced sentence was about two-thirds of the remaining duration of the remission order that was in effect when the accused committed the latest of his offences stated in the charges, the remaining duration being 295 days. I directed that the sentences for the urine charge and the utensils charge were to run consecutively and that the sentence for the possession charge was to run concurrently.</a></p><a id="p1_4"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Overview of the matter</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was not a complicated matter. Nonetheless, given that the trial proceedings spanned a not insubstantial period of about 15 days, I think it is useful to provide at the outset an overview of the entire matter so that the straightforward core issues are not obscured by peripheral detail. Hence I summarise here the crux of the prosecution’s case, the accused’s defence as I understood it, and my verdict.</a></p><a id="p1_5"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The prosecution’s case</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic outline of the prosecution’s narrative may be stated as follows. On 14&nbsp;July 2019, police officers arrived at La Mode (Sophia) Hotel (the “Hotel”) in Geylang around 1.00pm in response to a report of an assault by a guest on a member of the hotel staff. The officers gained entry to a room where they saw the accused lying on the floor. A search of the room turned up various items including two packets containing a crystalline substance, bongs, coloured straws and lighters. The officers seized the items and, taking the accused into their custody, brought him and the items in a police car to a police station in Bedok (“Bedok station”), where they seized another bong and coloured straw from the accused’s bag. At the police station the accused complained that he was unwell. An ambulance conveyed him to Changi General Hospital (“CGH”) and he was warded in the acute stroke unit there.</a></p><a id="p1_6"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around 6.30pm on 14&nbsp;July 2019 at CGH the accused was instructed by a police officer of sergeant rank to provide a specimen of his urine for testing. He was warned that failure to do so would constitute an offence. But despite the passage of several hours the accused did not provide a urine sample of sufficient volume. Eventually, around 3.30am on 15&nbsp;July 2019, the accused filled a master bottle with the required volume of his urine and poured most of the urine into two smaller sample bottles. But shortly after, in the presence of police officers, he crushed both sample bottles in his hands so that the urine spilled out, thereby rendering the samples unusable. He did not provide any further urine sample from that point on. This sequence of events gave rise to the urine charge.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the items that had been seized from the room at the Hotel occupied by the accused, they were stored at Bedok station and subsequently handed over to officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”). The crystalline substance that was among these items was subsequently sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis and was found to contain methamphetamine. This gave rise to the possession charge. The bongs, coloured straws and lighters seized from the room, and the bong and coloured straw in the accused’s bag (collectively the “Utensils”), gave rise to the utensils charge.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The accused’s defence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The precise nature of the accused’s defence was not easy to ascertain because he did not file written submissions and, when given the opportunity to make oral submissions, repeatedly said that he had nothing to submit, although he did eventually offer some substantive comments. That said, from those comments and from the accused’s evidence and various remarks at trial, there emerged several points that I thought I was obliged to address as possible defences. I summarise those points as follows.</a></p><a id="p1_9"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the possession charge and the utensils charge, the accused suggested during the trial that someone might have planted the crystalline substance, bongs, coloured straws and lighters in his room at the Hotel. He did not touch on this point during oral submissions.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the urine charge, I understood the accused’s primary defence to be that he had a reasonable excuse for not providing a urine specimen. This excuse was that he was medically unfit to provide a urine specimen because he suffered from bladder dysfunction. He contended in oral submissions that the authorities could and should have employed alternative means of testing whether he had consumed drugs, such as hair or saliva tests. He said that it was hazardous to his health to force him to drink water in order that he could give a urine sample.</a></p><a id="p1_11"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to the urine charge I understood the accused to have suggested during the trial that at the time he crushed the sample bottles in his hands he was mentally incapable of knowing what he was doing, because he had taken psychiatric medication about two hours before. He did not touch on this point during oral submissions.</a></p><a id="p1_12"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">My verdict</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting with the possession charge, the accused did not put forward any cogent evidence in support of the possibility that someone might have planted the methamphetamine that was seized from his room at the Hotel. This possibility therefore did not generate any reasonable doubt as to whether the accused had been in possession of the methamphetamine. He had exclusive physical control over the methamphetamine given that it was found in the room, and he was alone in the room and was the only guest of the Hotel who had access to the room, and there was no reasonable possibility that someone else might have had access to the room as well as a motive for falsely implicating the accused in an invented crime. I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he had brought into the room all the items that were seized from it, including the methamphetamine, and I saw no reason not to draw the natural inference that he knew of the existence of the items within the room. Thus it was clear to me that the accused had had methamphetamine in his possession.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gave rise to the presumption under s&nbsp;18(2) of the MDA that he had known the nature of the methamphetamine in his possession. There was no evidence at all to rebut this presumption, and on the contrary, in his statements to the police the accused admitted his knowledge of the nature of the drug in his possession by identifying the crystalline substance seized from his room as methamphetamine and explaining that it was meant for his own consumption. I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had without authorisation possessed methamphetamine knowing its nature, and so I convicted him on the possession charge.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the utensils charge, the accused likewise presented no cogent evidence of the possibility that someone might have planted the Utensils in his room at the Hotel or in his bag. Hence there was no doubt that the accused had had the Utensils in his possession in the sense that they were within his physical control and it could safely be inferred that he knew of the existence of the Utensils in the room and in his bag because he had himself placed the items there. I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the Utensils were in the nature of utensils intended for the consumption of controlled drugs, and I was also satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew the nature of the Utensils given that he had consumed drugs before and had also admitted this knowledge in some of his statements to the police. In addition, I was satisfied, should that be required, that the accused had in fact intended to use the Utensils for drug consumption. Accordingly I convicted him on the utensils charge.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the urine charge, I accepted that the medical evidence showed that the accused had had bladder dysfunction as at 14 and 15&nbsp;July 2019 when he was instructed to provide a specimen of his urine at CGH. But I rejected any suggestion that it was unreasonable to have expected the accused to have provided urine at that time. The uncontroversial fact was that the accused managed to provide a sample of his urine of the required volume but subsequently rendered that sample unusable by crushing the sample bottles in his hands so that the urine within spilled out. This being so I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had been physically capable of providing a specimen of his urine but simply did not want his urine to be tested. This clearly could not amount to a reasonable excuse for failing to provide a specimen of his urine.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was also satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that when the accused crushed the sample bottles in his hands he knew perfectly well what he was doing. Although the accused had consumed medication not long before carrying out that act, the medical evidence showed that the type and dosage of medication that he had taken would not likely cause him to lose the ability to appreciate what he was doing. Furthermore, from the video footage adduced in evidence of the accused’s act of crushing the sample bottles and the 30 or so&nbsp;seconds leading up to it, it was clear to me that he had been behaving rationally, in that he was able to furnish an alleged basis for crushing the sample bottles by expressing dissatisfaction at the urine procurement process. Hence I found that the accused had knowingly prevented his urine samples from being used for testing, and consequently I convicted him on the urine charge.</a></p><a id="p1_17"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary of the evidence and proceedings at trial</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prosecution called 23 witnesses in the trial. When the prosecution got to its 21st and 22nd witnesses there was an ancillary hearing to determine the admissibility of four statements that the accused had made to the police. At the conclusion of the ancillary hearing I ruled that all four statements were admissible. I will describe the ancillary hearing in greater detail later.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the prosecution had called its 23rd witness and concluded its case I called on the accused to give his defence. He chose to give evidence in his own defence. Thereafter he applied to me to issue process for compelling the attendance of several individuals whom he wanted to call as witnesses. Ultimately, for reasons that I will explain shortly, I issued process in respect of two of those individuals only because the prosecution objected to the others and I considered that the applications in respect of those others were frivolous, in the sense that those others did not appear to be in a position to give any relevant evidence. The two individuals attended court as compelled and gave evidence as the accused’s witnesses, and the accused closed his case thereafter. The prosecution did not call or recall any witnesses for the purpose of rebuttal.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The prosecution’s witnesses</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prosecution’s 23 witnesses in the main trial comprised:</a></p><a id="p1_20"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_20-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 witnesses who were police officers at the material time;</a></p><a id="p1_20-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_20-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;six witnesses who were CNB officers at the material time;</a></p><a id="p1_20-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_20-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one language translator employed by the CNB;</a></p><a id="p1_20-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_20-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one analyst from the HSA; and</a></p><a id="p1_20-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_20-p2_e">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;five medical doctors.</a></p><a id="p1_20-p2_e"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20-p2_e"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid repetition below, I do not propose to set out or summarise here the evidence provided by each witness. I think it is sufficient for now to provide a broad sketch of the involvement of each category of witness in this case.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 10 police officers were variously involved in (i)&nbsp;responding to the initial report of an assault at the Hotel on 14 July 2019 and gaining entry into the accused’s room, and searching the room and seizing the various items in it, (ii)&nbsp;conveying the accused and the seized items in a police car to Bedok station, (iii)&nbsp;storing and safekeeping the seized items at Bedok station, and then handing them over to CNB officers, (iv)&nbsp;accompanying the accused on his ambulance journey from Bedok station to CGH, and (v)&nbsp;staying with the accused at CGH and instructing him to provide a specimen of his urine, and supervising him as he provided his urine. One of the police officers recorded on his body-worn camera (“BWC”) video footage, with audio, of the accused’s act of crushing in his hands the sample bottles containing his urine, as well as the events before and after that act. This gave rise to the involvement of the language translator from the CNB: he prepared and signed a transcript of the dialogue audible in a portion of the BWC footage in both its original language (mainly Mandarin, with occasional English and Hokkien) and its English translation.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six CNB officers were variously involved in (i)&nbsp;taking over custody of the seized items from the relevant police officers at Bedok station, (ii)&nbsp;bringing the crystalline substance that was among the seized items to the HSA for testing, and (iii)&nbsp;obtaining statements from the accused. The analyst from the HSA was involved only to the extent that she tested the crystalline substance that had been seized from the accused’s room at the Hotel and concluded that it contained not less than 3.63g of methamphetamine.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the five medical doctors, four of them were involved&nbsp;in examining and attending to the accused at CGH from his admission on 14&nbsp;July 2019 to his discharge two days later on 16&nbsp;July 2019 and preparing the medical records concerning his admission during this period. The remaining doctor, Dr&nbsp;Yam Wai Loon (“Dr&nbsp;Yam”), designated PW12, was not involved in the accused’s admission at CGH during this period from 14 to 16&nbsp;July 2019 but he prepared and signed a medical report on the accused’s bladder dysfunction (marked P21) based on the accused’s visits to the Department of Urology at CGH before and after that period.</a></p><a id="p1_24"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defence’s witnesses</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the accused himself, Dr&nbsp;Cheow Enquan (“Dr&nbsp;Cheow”), designated DW2, and Mr&nbsp;Frank Tan, designated DW3, gave evidence as defence witnesses. Dr&nbsp;Cheow is a psychiatrist and in that professional capacity he saw the accused on three occasions, on 3&nbsp;June 2019 and 5 and 26 August 2019, which was shortly before and shortly after the accused’s alleged offences on 14 and 15&nbsp;July 2019.</a></p><a id="p1_25"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Frank Tan was working at the front desk of the Hotel on 14&nbsp;July 2019. He was the person who made the initial report of having been assaulted by a guest of the Hotel that resulted in the arrival of police officers at the Hotel.</a></p><a id="p1_26"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The witnesses the accused sought unsuccessfully to call</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were not more than three witnesses for the defence because, as earlier alluded to, I declined the accused’s applications for process to be issued to compel the attendance of five other witnesses. I had initially allowed one of those applications but subsequently had occasion to reconsider that decision and thereupon reversed it. I explain now who these individuals were whom the accused wished to call as witnesses and why I did not think that they should be compelled to attend court as witnesses.</a></p><a id="p1_27"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Dr&nbsp;Jaydip Sarkar (“Dr&nbsp;Jaydip”) is a psychiatrist who prepared and signed a medical report dated 6&nbsp;February 2017 on the accused’s mental condition following a psychiatric assessment at the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”). This medical report had been admitted into evidence (marked D3) through the accused during the ancillary hearing. To begin with, I thought that this report was of limited probative value given that it had been prepared more than two years before the accused’s alleged offences on 14 and 15 July 2019. To the extent that the accused wished to assert a defence to the effect that his mental state rendered him incapable of committing the alleged offences, what was material was his mental state at the time and not any earlier or later time. In this connection I would already be assisted by Dr&nbsp;Cheow’s evidence, which would be far more weighty than Dr&nbsp;Jaydip’s report given that Dr&nbsp;Cheow had seen the accused much nearer the time of the alleged offences, and so I did not think that Dr&nbsp;Jaydip’s report would add much to Dr&nbsp;Cheow’s evidence.</a></p><a id="p1_28"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Dr&nbsp;Jaydip’s report could be said to be marginally relevant to this case in that it showed that the accused had a history of psychiatric conditions, which could make it more likely that he had an underlying psychiatric condition at the time of the alleged offences, I did not see any utility in calling Dr&nbsp;Jaydip as a witness. This was because his medical report was already in evidence and I could have full regard to it, and if there was a need for an expert to explain the medical science and terminology in the report, I thought that Dr&nbsp;Cheow could serve this purpose when he took the stand. Given the length of time that had elapsed since Dr&nbsp;Jaydip assessed the accused, I expected that Dr&nbsp;Jaydip would not have any substantial recollection of the actual assessment and would have to rely wholly on the contents of his medical report anyway, meaning that there would be negligible advantage in having Dr&nbsp;Jaydip comment on his own report compared to having Dr&nbsp;Cheow opine on it. This lack of any utility in having Dr&nbsp;Jaydip attend court led me to consider that the accused’s application to call him as a witness was frivolous and should be refused.</a></p><a id="p1_29"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Dr&nbsp;Jacob Rajesh is a psychiatrist who in his professional capacity had been seeing the accused with some regularity from the time that the accused was remanded in custody on 22&nbsp;September 2019. But any evidence he might give would, at best, shed light on the accused’s mental state only after the time of the alleged offences, and I could not see how it would be at all probative of the material question of the accused’s mental state at the time of the alleged offences. For this reason I saw no value whatsoever in receiving evidence from this psychiatrist and I considered that the accused’s application to call him as a witness was frivolous and should be refused.</a></p><a id="p1_30"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, Ms Jasmine Soh was the accused’s case manager at IMH. The accused explained that her duty was to look after various aspects of his well-being including his work, lodging, finances and other personal issues, and that he contacted her regularly regarding these aspects before and after the time of the alleged offences in July&nbsp;2019. The accused contended that she would be able to give evidence on his behaviour and conduct and state of mind before and after the time of the alleged offences. But I could not see how her evidence would be at all relevant to my determination of whether the accused had committed the alleged offences of possessing drugs and drug-taking utensils and of failing without reasonable excuse to provide a urine specimen. At best, she would be able to apprise me of the accused’s personal circumstances that formed the background to the alleged offences, but this was simply irrelevant to his guilt or innocence on the charges. Hence I thought that it was a frivolous application to compel her to attend court and I declined to grant it.</a></p><a id="p1_31"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, Mr Faisal – the accused did not know his full name and referred to him as Chief Warden Faisal – was the officer in overall charge of the accused in respect of the mandatory aftercare scheme on which the accused was placed following his release from prison on 1&nbsp;June 2019. The accused explained that he had to report monthly to Mr&nbsp;Faisal and was thereby constantly in contact with him, and he argued that Mr&nbsp;Faisal would be able to give evidence as to his behaviour and state of mind before and after the time of the alleged offences. But as with Ms&nbsp;Jasmine Soh I thought that Mr&nbsp;Faisal’s evidence would relate only to the accused’s personal circumstances which were irrelevant to the his criminal liability in respect of the charges, and so I considered that his application to compel Mr&nbsp;Faisal was frivolous and should be refused.</a></p><a id="p1_32"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, Dr&nbsp;Cho Me Me Htet (“Dr Cho”) is a medical doctor involved in this case only to the extent that she prepared and signed a memo dated 15&nbsp;July 2019 stating that the accused was “able to pass urine without any issue” and was “fit for investigation”. The prosecution initially did not object to the accused’s application to compel Dr&nbsp;Cho to attend court and so I allowed it. The deputy public prosecutor Ms&nbsp;Teo Siu Ming took it upon herself to contact Dr&nbsp;Cho with a view to making arrangements for her to attend court – for which I record my appreciation to Ms&nbsp;Teo – but then Dr&nbsp;Cho informed the prosecution that she was located in the UK and was unwilling to testify, even by means of video link. Prompted by this development I asked the accused to clarify what the evidence was that he hoped to adduce from Dr&nbsp;Cho. He explained that he wished essentially to test whether Dr&nbsp;Cho had given a proper opinion in her memo dated 15&nbsp;July 2019. He said that the memo had started the process of urine testing at CGH, and that if not for the memo the process might have been avoided and other testing methods, such as hair and saliva testing, might have been used. He added that he needed to know the true reasons why Dr&nbsp;Cho wrote the memo.</a></p><a id="p1_33"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard the accused’s clarification Ms&nbsp;Teo indicated that the prosecution was objecting to Dr&nbsp;Cho’s attendance in court as a witness on the ground that her evidence would be irrelevant, and I thought that the objection was sound. The crux of the accused’s defence on the urine charge was that his bladder dysfunction constituted a reasonable excuse for his failure to provide a urine specimen. In assessing the viability of this defence I already had the benefit of extensive evidence including oral and documentary evidence of the accused’s actual ability or lack thereof to provide urine in CGH on 14 and 15&nbsp;July 2019, and the views of Dr&nbsp;Yam on the condition of the accused’s bladder. The prosecution had not even sought to rely on Dr&nbsp;Cho’s memo as evidence that the accused was capable of passing urine – it was the accused who had put the memo, marked D4, into evidence – and so I was prepared to, and did in fact, disregard the memo entirely in considering the question of whether the accused was physically able to provide a urine specimen. Even if the memo might have started the process of urine testing at CGH, the manner of its starting would not ultimately matter in any way to my determination of whether the accused had reasonable excuse for not providing a urine specimen. Therefore I saw no point in compelling Dr&nbsp;Cho to attend court as a witness and I considered that the accused’s application to compel her was frivolous and should be refused, and accordingly I reversed my earlier decision to issue process.</a></p><a id="p1_34"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The accused’s unsuccessful applications for evidence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extent of the evidence adduced at the trial was not greater than what it was because I declined to grant any of the applications for evidence that the accused made during the trial. I briefly explain now why I so declined.</a></p><a id="p1_35"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused’s applications were of two kinds. First, he applied in the midst of the prosecution’s case to recall prosecution witnesses who had already been examined. He made the application after the prosecution’s 14th witness – the translator from the CNB – had finished giving his testimony, and the application was to recall all the police officers who had given testimony up to that point. Second, he applied at various points during the trial for production of the following documents or things:</a></p><a id="p1_36"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_36-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CCTV video footage from Bedok station;</a></p><a id="p1_36-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_36-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;video footage from any BWC of any police officer who was present with him during his admission at CGH from 14 to 16&nbsp;July 2019;</a></p><a id="p1_36-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_36-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;field diaries and pocket books of the police officers who attended court as witnesses; and</a></p><a id="p1_36-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_36-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his electronic medical records maintained on the National Electronic Health Record system.</a></p><a id="p1_36-p2_d"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The application to recall witnesses</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understood it the accused wanted to recall those of the prosecution’s first to 13th witnesses who were police officers in order to examine them on their BWCs and their pocket books, and he wished to do so in order to establish three broad points. First, that during his admission in CGH he did not at any time refuse to drink water. Second, what the lengths of the intervals were between the occasions on which he drank water and the warning administered to him around 6.30pm on 14&nbsp;July 2019 that it was an offence not to provide a urine specimen when required to do so. Third, that he cooperated with the police officers in their attempts to get him to provide a urine specimen.</a></p><a id="p1_37"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that all three points the accused wished to establish had already been canvassed at length during the testimonies of the police officers among the prosecution’s first to 13th witnesses. On the first and second points the police officers had in fact broadly agreed with his characterisation of events, in that they agreed that he did not refuse to drink water and that the warning that failure to provide a urine specimen would be an offence was administered once around 6.30pm on 14&nbsp;July 2019 and was not administered again before the accused crushed in his hands the sample bottles containing his urine around 3.30am on 15 July 2019. I also could not see how the second point was relevant to the question of whether the accused was guilty on the urine charge. As for the third point, although the police officers did not agree that he had been cooperative, I was satisfied that the accused had had ample opportunity to put to them his case that he had been cooperative and that the non-provision of a urine specimen was due to his inability to urinate and not any wilful refusal to do so. Given that these points had already been explored in detail during the testimonies of the police officers I did not see anything to be gained in recalling them.</a></p><a id="p1_38"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the accused’s wish to examine the police officers on their BWCs and pocket books, given that I declined to order production of BWC video footage and pocket books – for reasons I will explain shortly – I did not think that there was any utility in recalling witnesses just so they could be asked about these documents or things that would not form part of the evidence in this case. Accordingly I dismissed the accused’s application to recall witnesses.</a></p><a id="p1_39"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The applications for documents and things</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a><a id="p1_40">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the accused’s applications for production of various documents and things, my starting point was that, pursuant to the decision of the Court of Appeal in <em>Muhammad bin Kadar and another v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/12985-SSP-M.xml')">[2011] 3 SLR 1205</a> at [113], the prosecution had an obligation to disclose to the accused any unused material that might reasonably be regarded as credible and relevant to his guilt or innocence, or that might provide a real chance of uncovering such credible and relevant material. I thought that the accused did not put forward any plausible basis to think that the prosecution had not complied with this obligation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also thought that the accused failed to show how the documents and things that he sought were relevant to his guilt or innocence. Although he could not be expected to know the contents of documents and things that he had never seen, I expected him at least to suggest lines of inquiry connected to those documents or things that might be relevant to his guilt or innocence. But he was in my view unable to do so. It appeared to me that his general approach in this regard was to request the production of documents and things just because they existed, or might exist, and could possibly contain evidence useful to his case. I did not think it would be right to endorse such a speculative approach.</a></p><a id="p1_41"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a><a id="p1_42">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate, the accused applied for production of video footage from any BWC of any police officer who accompanied him at CGH just because he learnt during the trial that the BWCs are kept switched on at all times. In effect he made the application just because such footage might be supposed to exist and would relate to events in this case. But he did not explain what the footage might be expected to show and how that might shed any light on the question of whether he was guilty or innocent. Even if the footage did exist, given the prosecution’s disclosure obligations I had no reason to think that the contents of the footage would be useful to the accused. Thus it seemed to me that it was neither necessary nor desirable to order production of the BWC footage.</a></p><a id="p1_42"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a><a id="p1_43">43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the accused applied for production of police officers’ field diaries and pocket books just because police officers are required to use such things. He offered no suggestion of what I might expect to see in those things that could be relevant to the issues I had to decide. Again, given the prosecution’s disclosure obligations I had no reason to think that the contents of the field diaries or pocket books would be useful to the accused, and so I thought it neither necessary nor desirable to order their production.</a></p><a id="p1_43"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a><a id="p1_44">44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be fair to the accused, there was an exception to his lack of specificity in applying for production of documents or things. In applying for production of his electronic medical records he explained that he wanted to see the charts showing his consumption of food and water during his admission at CGH from 14 to 16&nbsp;July 2019. But I could not perceive the relevance of such charts. My understanding of the accused’s case on the urine charge was that he had been genuinely incapable of providing a urine specimen. I could not see how the amount of food and water that he consumed or the timing of consumption would have any bearing on the question of whether he was physically unable to provide a urine specimen. That being so I thought that it would be neither necessary nor desirable to order production of his electronic medical records.</a></p><a id="p1_44"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The ancillary hearing</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a><a id="p1_45">45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At issue in the ancillary hearing was the admissibility of the following four statements that the accused had made to the police:</a></p><a id="p1_45"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45"></a><a id="p1_45-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one statement dated 15&nbsp;July 2019 that was made during the accused’s admission at CGH;</a></p><a id="p1_45-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_45-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one statement dated 6&nbsp;August 2019; and</a></p><a id="p1_45-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_45-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two cautioned statements dated 24&nbsp;September 2019 made pursuant to s&nbsp;23 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”), one concerning the possession charge and the other concerning the utensils charge.</a></p><a id="p1_45-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_46">46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sequence of the ancillary hearing was as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_46"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46"></a><a id="p1_46-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the prosecution called two witnesses, both of whom were CNB officers and were also witnesses in the main trial;</a></p><a id="p1_46-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_46-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the accused gave evidence without calling any other witness; and</a></p><a id="p1_46-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_46-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the prosecution called nine other witnesses for the purpose of rebuttal, one of whom was a CNB officer who was also a witness in the main trial, and the remaining eight of whom were police officers who were witnesses in the ancillary hearing only.</a></p><a id="p1_46-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_47">47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no allegation by the accused that he was in a state of near delirium when he made any of the statements such that his mind did not go with the statements he was making. In any event it seemed clear to me on the face of all four statements that they were the products of a rational mind. Hence, I had only to consider whether the making of the statements had been caused by any threat, inducement or promise or other oppressive circumstances.</a></p><a id="p1_47"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a><a id="p1_48">48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting with the latest statements, the two made on 24&nbsp;September 2019, the accused accepted that the CNB officer who recorded the statements did not make any threat, inducement or promise, and the accused did not allege any oppressive circumstances in relation to the recording. Given the accused’s position there was no cause to find these statements inadmissible and I admitted them into evidence accordingly. They were marked P22 and P23.</a></p><a id="p1_48"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a><a id="p1_49">49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two statements were both recorded by Sergeant Mohammed Hambali bin Amir (“Sgt&nbsp;Hambali”) of the CNB, designated AH-PW1 in the ancillary hearing and PW21 in the main trial. According to the accused, during the recording of both statements Sgt&nbsp;Hambali was accompanied by another CNB officer, Station Inspector Mohamad Hafiz bin Jumali (“SI&nbsp;Hafiz”), designated AH-PW3 in the ancillary hearing and PW15 in the main trial.</a></p><a id="p1_49"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The statement made on 6&nbsp;August 2019</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a><a id="p1_50">50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering first the statement made on 6&nbsp;August 2019, the accused’s only allegation of any threat, inducement or promise was that SI&nbsp;Hafiz said that the accused had been very “<em>yaya</em>”, meaning arrogant, at CGH, and that he – SI&nbsp;Hafiz – had wanted to “whack” the accused. SI Hafiz’s testimony in this connection was that he could not recall exactly where he had been on 6&nbsp;August 2019 and whether he had interacted with the accused at all.</a></p><a id="p1_50"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a><a id="p1_51">51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that the accused’s allegation against SI&nbsp;Hafiz was highly unlikely to be true. This was so for three reasons. First, I found SI&nbsp;Hafiz to be a truthful witness and believed his testimony. He could have categorically denied threatening the accused but said instead that he could not recall, which struck me as a candid position to take. Thus it seemed to me likely that nothing extraordinary or significant occurred on 6&nbsp;August 2019 that would stick in SI&nbsp;Hafiz’s memory, which made it unlikely that he said what he was alleged to have said. Second, I thought it inherently unlikely that SI&nbsp;Hafiz would have been so irked or irritated by the accused’s behaviour at CGH that he would have said what he was alleged to have said. SI Hafiz was at CGH only to accompany Sgt&nbsp;Hambali for the purpose of obtaining the accused’s earliest statement on 15&nbsp;July 2019, and as such would have had very limited interaction with the accused. My impression of SI&nbsp;Hafiz on the witness stand was that he is a composed individual whose emotions do not fluctuate greatly. Given this impression it seemed to me implausible that SI&nbsp;Hafiz would have been so emotionally affected by his limited interaction with the accused at CGH that he would bring the topic up a few weeks later on 6&nbsp;August 2019.</a></p><a id="p1_51"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a><a id="p1_52">52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, as the prosecution pointed out, the accused made the allegation against SI&nbsp;Hafiz in a belated manner. SI Hafiz had been called as a witness in the main trial even before the ancillary hearing but the accused did not make the allegation when cross-examining SI&nbsp;Hafiz then. During the ancillary hearing the accused gave testimony before SI&nbsp;Hafiz did because SI&nbsp;Hafiz was one of the prosecution’s nine rebuttal witnesses, and I thought it pertinent that the accused did not make the allegation against SI&nbsp;Hafiz in his examination-in-chief. The accused made the allegation for the first time when undergoing cross-examination by the prosecution. From this I inferred that the accused’s allegation against SI Hafiz was no more than an afterthought and invention.</a></p><a id="p1_52"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a><a id="p1_53">53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was therefore satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that when the accused made the statement on 6&nbsp;August 2019 SI Hafiz did not say anything about the accused having been “<em>yaya</em>’ at CGH and wanting to “whack” him. It followed that I was satisfied that the making of the statement had not been induced by any threat, inducement or promise or oppressive circumstances. Accordingly I admitted the statement into evidence and marked it P12.</a></p><a id="p1_53"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The statement made on 15&nbsp;July 2019</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a><a id="p1_54">54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving at last to the statement made on 15&nbsp;July 2019 around 9.40pm, the accused made the following three allegations. First, that either Sgt&nbsp;Hambali or SI&nbsp;Hafiz promised that he would be released on bail if he gave a good statement. Second, that SI&nbsp;Hafiz threatened to charge him with the offence of drug trafficking if he did not admit to other offences. Third, that the statement was made in oppressive circumstances in the sense that he was constantly forced to drink water at CGH and was continuously told that failure to provide a urine specimen would constitute an offence, and meanwhile the medical staff at CGH were unhelpful towards him, and all this caused him stress and pressure of a traumatic nature.</a></p><a id="p1_54"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a><a id="p1_55">55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rejected the first allegation. To begin with, the fact that the accused could not point with certainty to either Sgt&nbsp;Hambali or SI Hafiz as the person who had made the promise cast doubt on whether the promise had been made at all, because I thought that such a promise would have been an unusual enough occurrence that the accused would reasonably be expected to recall at least the precise individual who had made it. Sgt&nbsp;Hambali testified that the usual protocol is to give bail as a matter of course if investigations have been completed, and I accepted the truth of this testimony given that the CPC does not grant law enforcement authorities freedom to keep accused persons in custody for however long they like. That being so I could not see any sensible reason why Sgt&nbsp;Hambali or SI Hafiz would have suggested that bail was contingent on the accused giving a good statement.</a></p><a id="p1_55"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a><a id="p1_56">56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also rejected the second allegation. SI&nbsp;Hafiz denied that he threatened to charge the accused with the offence of drug trafficking, and so on this point it was effectively one person’s word against another. I had regard to the contents of the statement dated 15&nbsp;July 2019 and I thought it material that, as the prosecution pointed out, the accused was able in making that statement to deny having committed the offence of consuming controlled drugs – this was at the fifth question-answer pair in the statement. Given that the accused’s allegation was that SI&nbsp;Hafiz threatened to charge him with drug trafficking unless he admitted to other offences, the fact that he did not admit to this other offence of drug consumption made it seem unlikely that the threat was made. Even if the threat was made, this same fact that he did not admit to the offence of drug consumption must mean that the threat did not affect what he chose to say in his statement and so could not have caused the statement to be made.</a></p><a id="p1_56"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a><a id="p1_57">57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also rejected the third allegation. All eight police officers who attended court as rebuttal witnesses in the ancillary hearing consistently and clearly testified that they had never forced the accused to drink water. The prosecution called these eight police officers as rebuttal witnesses because the accused himself had requested that he be given an opportunity to examine the police officers who had stayed with him at CGH from his admission around 5.00pm on 14&nbsp;July 2019 to the taking of his statement on 15&nbsp;July 2019 around 9.40pm. That is, Ms&nbsp;Teo offered to call these police officers as rebuttal witnesses to give the accused the opportunity that he requested, which was a very helpful and reasonable position to take. Quite sensibly the prosecution did not call all the police officers who had been with the accused at CGH throughout that period. The accused had already examined in the main trial police officers who had been with him at CGH from 5.00pm on 14&nbsp;July 2019 to 6.00am on 15&nbsp;July 2019, and as for the period between 6.00am and 9.40pm on 15&nbsp;July 2019, given that the police officers were on duty at CGH in pairs it was sufficient to call just one of each pair that had been with the accused at any given time. The important point was that the testimonies of the eight police officers who attended court as rebuttal witnesses in the ancillary hearing spanned the entirety of the period between 6.00am and 9.40pm on 15&nbsp;July 2019, and in fact extended some hours before and after that period. Hence I was amply satisfied that the accused had had full opportunity to advance his allegations of oppression by the police officers who had accompanied him during his admission at CGH.</a></p><a id="p1_57"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a><a id="p1_58">58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The testimonies of the police officers were based on handwritten entries they had made in a police station diary, the relevant excerpts from which were admitted into evidence and marked P15 and P15A. Many of them frankly stated that they had no personal recollection of the events involving the accused at CGH and that they were relying entirely on the diary entries. I thought that this was completely understandable and I accepted as truth the information recorded in the entries. I did not think it a reasonable possibility that the police officers might have deliberately entered untrue information in the diary because I could not see what they would have to gain personally in doing so, and I also did not think it a reasonable possibility that they might have mistakenly entered inaccurate information because the entries were made very near the occurrence of the events that they recorded, that is contemporaneously. On the strength of the police officers’ testimonies and the diary entries, I was satisfied beyond any doubt that all the police officers had done was to give the accused regular opportunities to drink water against the backdrop of a prevailing understanding that it was an offence not to provide a urine specimen. I could not see any reason whatsoever why any of them would have been so interested in the accused’s drinking of water that they would have compelled him to do so. The accused might have felt subjectively that he had no choice but to drink water, but that was not the same thing as having been forced to drink.</a></p><a id="p1_58"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a><a id="p1_59">59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also found it very difficult to believe the accused’s allegation that the medical staff at CGH were not helpful and were conspiring the make life difficult for him. In particular, the accused made a specific allegation that was patently inconsistent with the documentary evidence. He alleged that the staff at CGH had failed to follow protocol, in that even though his “PHQ-4 screening score” was 3 he was not referred to a “Psychiatric Occupational Therapist” as required. But the CGH admission records, marked as P18, clearly recorded that the referral was made and that an occupational therapist attempted to see the accused on 16&nbsp;July 2019 around 10.15am but he “was sleeping and refused to open his eyes”, which I interpreted as a wilful refusal to be woken up. Hence I was satisfied that the accused had falsely accused the medical staff at CGH of failing to follow protocol in this respect. This made me doubt the accused’s general attack on the conduct of the CGH medical staff during his admission from 14 to 16&nbsp;July 2019, which in turn made me doubt his overall credibility as a witness, which in turn cast substantial doubt on his allegations against Sgt&nbsp;Hambali and SI Hafiz and the police officers concerning the making of his statement on 15&nbsp;July 2019.</a></p><a id="p1_59"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a><a id="p1_60">60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrasting the accused’s dubious credibility with the believable and sensible testimonies of Sgt&nbsp;Hambali and SI&nbsp;Hafiz and the police officers, I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that neither Sgt Hambali nor SI Hafiz had promised to release the accused on bail if he gave a good statement, that SI&nbsp;Hafiz had not threatened to charge the accused with the offence of drug trafficking if he did not admit to other offences, and that none of the police officers who accompanied the accused during his admission at CGH ever forced him to drink water. I was therefore satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that there was no threat, inducement or promise or any oppression in the making of the statement on 15&nbsp;July 2019. Accordingly I held that this statement was admissible in evidence and marked it P11.</a></p><a id="p1_60"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">My findings from the evidence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The reliability of the testimony of the prosecution’s witnesses</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a><a id="p1_61">61&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All 23 of the prosecution’s witnesses became involved in this case while doing their jobs and did not know the accused prior to becoming involved. If they had any interactions with the accused at all during their involvement in this case those interactions were not protracted, lasting no more than several hours at a time, and occurred once or at most on a handful of occasions. In these circumstances it seemed to me that all 23 witnesses had no personal interest in the accused’s fate and thus had no reason not to be honest when giving their testimonies in court. Nothing in the accused’s cross-examination of these 23 witnesses gave rise to any doubt as to their honesty.</a></p><a id="p1_61"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a><a id="p1_62">62&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The testimonies of the witnesses were largely based on and supported by contemporaneous documentary records of an official nature that those witnesses had made. In particular, the testimonies of the police officers who were present at CGH with the accused were based on the handwritten entries in a police station diary that I alluded to above in the context of the ancillary hearing, and the testimonies of the police officers who handled the items that were seized from the accused’s room at the Hotel were based on reports and forms that recorded such information as the description of the items seized, the date and time at which the items were handed from one individual to another, and the identities of those individuals. The testimonies of the medical doctors were based on medical reports that they or other doctors had prepared, as well as CGH admission records.</a></p><a id="p1_62"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a><a id="p1_63">63&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that the official and contemporaneous nature of these documentary records meant that they could be regarded as reliable evidence of the information recorded therein, unless there was reason to think that the people who entered the information in the records might have erred, whether intentionally or accidentally, in doing so. Nothing in the testimonies of all 23 witnesses, even under cross-examination from the accused, revealed any reason whatsoever to think that they might have deliberately presented untruths in the records or inadvertently made a mistake of a substantial and not merely formal or typographical nature. Thus I accepted entirely the truth of the information contained in the contemporaneous documentary records.</a></p><a id="p1_63"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a><a id="p1_64">64&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the testimonies of the witnesses was not based on or supported by contemporaneous documentary records, there was nothing that cast doubt on its veracity. Where there were multiple witnesses at an event their descriptions of that event were all broadly consistent. To illustrate, the four police officers who entered the accused’s room at the Hotel on 14&nbsp;July 2019 all testified that the accused was conscious but had his eyes closed for long stretches of time, and was not cooperative.</a></p><a id="p1_64"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a><a id="p1_65">65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I found that the testimonies of all 23 of the prosecution’s witnesses were reliable. I set out now the findings of fact I reached on the basis of their testimonies and relevant documentary records.</a></p><a id="p1_65"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The accused’s arrest at the Hotel and transfer to Bedok station</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a><a id="p1_66">66&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around 1.00pm on 14&nbsp;July 2019 four police officers entered the accused’s room at the Hotel, namely Sergeant Ong Jin Hong (“Sgt&nbsp;Ong”), Sergeant Tan Shun Hua (“Sgt&nbsp;Andy”), Sergeant Chan Lip Yang Demian and Sergeant Muhammad Faresh Hakim bin Mohd Yazid (“Sgt&nbsp;Faresh”), designated PW1 to PW4 respectively. Sgt&nbsp;Ong and Sgt&nbsp;Faresh searched the room and seized various items in it because they looked like they might be drugs or utensils meant for the consumption of drugs. They placed the seized items in a plastic bag that they found among the accused’s belongings. The police officers suspected that the accused might have consumed illicit drugs given the items found in the room and because he appeared to be intoxicated even though there was no sign that he had consumed alcohol. They placed the accused under arrest.</a></p><a id="p1_66"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a><a id="p1_67">67&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sgt&nbsp;Ong and Sgt&nbsp;Andy conveyed the accused to Bedok station in a police car. Sgt&nbsp;Ong drove while Sgt&nbsp;Andy held on to the plastic bag containing the seized items. Following their arrival at Bedok station the accused was brought to the lock-up and handed over to the officers there. In the lock-up the accused claimed that he was unable to feel half of his body. An ambulance was called to convey him to CGH. Meanwhile, Station Inspector Mohamed Khairil bin Mohamed Sanwan (“SI&nbsp;Khairil”), designated PW5, assisted Sgt&nbsp;Ong in sorting out the seized items at Bedok station. SI&nbsp;Khairil and Sgt&nbsp;Ong laid the seized items on a tray and asked the accused in the lock-up to acknowledge verbally that these items belonged to him, and then placed the items into a polymer bag that they sealed. Sgt&nbsp;Ong also started the process of lodging a report cataloguing the seized items (marked P2) but was unable to complete it because he had to follow the accused to CGH. SI&nbsp;Khairil took over the process and completed the report on Sgt&nbsp;Ong’s behalf.</a></p><a id="p1_67"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The accused’s admission at CGH</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a><a id="p1_68">68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My understanding of the events that occurred at CGH was obtained in the main from the handwritten station diary entries that were marked P15. These entries recorded events that took place between 5.00pm on 14&nbsp;July 2019 and 8.30am on 15&nbsp;July 2019.</a></p><a id="p1_68"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a><a id="p1_69">69&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sgt&nbsp;Ong and Sgt&nbsp;Andy stayed with the accused from 5.00pm on 14 July 2019 to the end of their shift around 7.10pm the same day. Around 6.30pm Sgt&nbsp;Ong instructed the accused to provide samples of his urine and warned him that it was an offence not to do so. The accused seemed paranoid to Sgt&nbsp;Ong, and he informed Sgt Ong that he was unable to provide urine. Around 6.45pm the accused drank three cups of water.</a></p><a id="p1_69"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a><a id="p1_70">70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At some point during his shift Sgt&nbsp;Ong signed the report that he had started lodging at Bedok station but had been unable to complete. Sgt&nbsp;Ong was able to do so because SI&nbsp;Khairil brought it to CGH for his signature. This report contained a minor error in that one part of the seized items was described as “One green bong wrapped in newspaper” when in fact it should have referred to one green straw and bong. This error was corrected in a further report (marked P3) that SI&nbsp;Khairil prepared and likewise brought to CGH for Sgt&nbsp;Ong’s signature. SI&nbsp;Khairil also brought the seized items to CGH for Sgt&nbsp;Ong’s inspection. SI&nbsp;Khairil and Sgt&nbsp;Ong both explained that even though SI&nbsp;Khairil had completed both reports they were in Sgt Ong’s name because Sgt&nbsp;Ong had omitted to log out of the computer system in rushing to accompany the accused to CGH. I thought this completely understandable and reasonable and saw nothing untoward in it.</a></p><a id="p1_70"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a><a id="p1_71">71&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around 7.10pm another pair of police officers took over the duty of staying with the accused at CGH. One of them, Inspector Jannson Koh Jing Wen (“Insp&nbsp;Jannson”), attended court as a witness and was designated PW11. Around 8.20pm the accused provided 60ml of urine, but this fell short of the 80ml required under the procedure prescribed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs (Urine Specimens and Urine Tests) Regulations (Cap&nbsp;185, Rg&nbsp;6, 1999 Ed). Insp Jannson reported this development to a CNB duty officer and was told that more urine should be procured. But the accused did not provide any more urine before the end of Insp&nbsp;Jannson’s shift around 1.06am on 15&nbsp;July 2019.</a></p><a id="p1_71"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a><a id="p1_72">72&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pair of police officers who took over from Insp&nbsp;Jannson included Staff Sergeant Lee Wee Chang (“SSgt&nbsp;Lee”), who attended court as a witness and was designated PW13. During this process of handing and taking over Insp&nbsp;Jannson informed SSgt&nbsp;Lee that the accused had previously given only 60ml of urine and that the instructions from the CNB duty officer were to obtain more urine from the accused so that the volume would reach 80ml. Around 1.45am the accused was given his prescribed medication. Around 2.30am the accused’s behaviour turned aggressive because he had not been given one of the three types of medication he regularly received, but by 2.45am he had gone back to sleep.</a></p><a id="p1_72"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a><a id="p1_73">73&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The event crucial to the urine charge occurred around 3.30am. The accused informed SSgt&nbsp;Lee or his partner, or both, that he needed to urinate urgently, and he was told that the process of procuring his urine would resume and he needed to urinate in the master bottle that contained the 60ml he had previously provided. The accused complied, in that he went to the restroom and filled the master bottle to the 80ml mark, and then poured the urine therein into two sample bottles with blue caps. The accused walked out of the restroom and sat in a chair next to his bed, and either SSgt&nbsp;Lee or his partner sealed both sample bottles with transparent scotch tape because there was no masking tape available. The accused was informed that the sample bottles would be sealed in a polymer bag with his particulars written on the bag.</a></p><a id="p1_73"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a><a id="p1_74">74&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened next was recorded in video footage from SSgt&nbsp;Lee’s BWC – the relevant portion of this footage was admitted into evidence and marked P16, and the transcript of the dialogue therein in its original language and English translation was likewise admitted into evidence and was marked P17. To paraphrase the exchange between the accused and SSgt&nbsp;Lee, the accused suggested that SSgt&nbsp;Lee and his partner had not properly sealed the sample bottles and had not taken adequate precautions against the possibility of subsequent tampering with the sample bottles. The accused was holding both sample bottles at this time, one in each hand. SSgt&nbsp;Lee sought to assure the accused that the sample bottles would be placed in full view of the accused and would not be tampered with. The accused asked if anyone from the CNB would be arriving at once, and SSgt&nbsp;Lee answered in the negative. In response the accused crushed both sample bottles in his hands such that the urine within spilled out, and then he threw both bottles on the floor.</a></p><a id="p1_74"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a><a id="p1_75">75&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SSgt&nbsp;Lee reported this development to Sgt&nbsp;Hambali, who instructed that the crushed sample bottles should be discarded and that a fresh urine specimen should be obtained from the accused. There was no significant occurrence from then until the end of SSgt&nbsp;Lee’s shift around 6.00am.</a></p><a id="p1_75"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The chain of custody of the seized items</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a><a id="p1_76">76&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As these events involving the accused were taking place at CGH, the items that had been seized from his room at the Hotel were stored at Bedok station. I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that the evidence established beyond any reasonable doubt an unbroken chain of custody in respect of the seized items such that I could be certain that the crystalline substance that the analyst from the HSA, Ms&nbsp;Kwang Jia Yi (“Ms&nbsp;Kwang”), designated PW18, tested and found to contain not less than 3.63g of methamphetamine was precisely the same crystalline substance that had been seized from the accused’s room. I trace now the links in that unbroken chain of custody.</a></p><a id="p1_76"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a><a id="p1_77">77&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned above, at the Hotel the seized items were placed in a plastic bag, and Sgt&nbsp;Andy held on to this plastic bag in the police car on the journey from the Hotel to Bedok station. At Bedok station, he handed the plastic bag to Sgt&nbsp;Ong. SI&nbsp;Khairil and Sgt&nbsp;Ong placed the seized items – which by now included the items that were recovered from the accused’s bag in the lock-up of Bedok station – into a polymer bag and sealed it. Later Sgt&nbsp;Ong was called away to accompany the accused to CGH, and so he handed the polymer bag containing the seized items to SI&nbsp;Khairil. Subsequently SI&nbsp;Khairil brought the items to CGH for Sgt&nbsp;Ong to inspect, and then SI&nbsp;Khairil took them back with him to Bedok station.</a></p><a id="p1_77"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a><a id="p1_78">78&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On returning to Bedok station SI&nbsp;Khairil handed the seized items to the charge office sometime before 8.00pm on 14&nbsp;July 2019. A contemporaneous document titled “Charger Returns” (marked P4) showed that the seized items were stored with the charge office on 14&nbsp;July 2019 by the time the second of the day’s two shifts started around 8.00pm, and that they were no longer stored with the charge office on 16&nbsp;July 2019 by the time the first of the day’s two shifts started around 8.00am. It followed that the seized items were received by the charge office sometime between 8.00am and 8.00pm on 14&nbsp;July 2019 and were removed from the charge office sometime between 8.00pm on 15&nbsp;July 2019 and 8.00am on 16&nbsp;July 2019. I had the benefit of testimony from two police officers who were on duty in the charge office in the intervening period. Station Inspector Nur Farhana binte Mezali, designated PW6, was on duty from 8.00am to 8.00pm on 14&nbsp;July 2019, and Sergeant Yeo Ru Yue, designated PW7, was on duty from 8.00pm on 15&nbsp;July 2019 to 8.00am on 16&nbsp;July 2019. They both explained how the “Charger Returns” should be interpreted, and they also explained that while the seized items were with the charge office they were stored in a locked safe therein to which only the officers on duty had the key. I was thus satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that after SI&nbsp;Khairil handed over the seized items to the charge office before 8.00pm on 14&nbsp;July 2019 they were stored in the charge office and were not tampered with, and were subsequently removed between 8.00pm on 15&nbsp;July 2019 and 8.00am the following day.</a></p><a id="p1_78"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a><a id="p1_79">79&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent with the aforementioned sequence of events, Senior Staff Sergeant Muhammad Taufiq bin Abdul Samad, designated PW8, testified that shortly before 8.15pm on 15&nbsp;July 2019 he obtained the key to the locked safe in the charge office and removed from it the seized items in the sealed polymer bag. He said that he proceeded to hand the bag of items over to SI&nbsp;Hafiz of the CNB around 8.15pm. This fact was clearly recorded in two acknowledgment slips, marked P5 and P6, that were signed by both officers.</a></p><a id="p1_79"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a><a id="p1_80">80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SI&nbsp;Hafiz testified, and I accepted, that he proceeded to remove the seized items from the sealed polymer bag and separate them into individual items or groups of items that he labelled “A” to “F” (marked P27 to P32 respectively) and take photographs of each discrete item or group of items. When the accused suggested in cross-examination that SI&nbsp;Hafiz had tampered with the items SI&nbsp;Hafiz firmly denied it, and I could see no ground for doubting his denial given the lack of any conceivable reason why he would have wanted to frame the accused for an offence he had not committed. SI&nbsp;Hafiz placed each discrete item or group of items that he had labelled “A” to “F” into their own tamper-proof bag but did not seal the bags. He handed the unsealed bags to Sgt&nbsp;Hambali.</a></p><a id="p1_80"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a><a id="p1_81">81&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having received the unsealed bags from SI&nbsp;Hafiz, Sgt&nbsp;Hambali sealed the bags and placed them in a metal cabinet in a room at Bedok station. The fact that the items were placed in the metal cabinet was supported by a handwritten entry in a logbook, the relevant page of which was admitted in evidence and marked P8. Sgt&nbsp;Hambali explained, and I accepted, that he wrote this entry around the time that he placed the items in the metal cabinet so as to record this fact. Sgt&nbsp;Hambali locked the metal cabinet, and he explained that this was a number lock and that only the CNB officers in Bedok station knew the combination that would unlock it. Sgt&nbsp;Hambali then went to CGH, accompanied by SI Hafiz, to take the accused’s statement around 9.40pm on 15&nbsp;July 2019.</a></p><a id="p1_81"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a><a id="p1_82">82&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seized items remained in the metal cabinet until they were removed on 16&nbsp;July 2019 by Sergeant Muhammad Sufyan bin Mohamad Khairolzaman (“Sgt&nbsp;Sufyan”), designated PW16. The fact that he removed the items on this date was apparent from a handwritten entry that he had made in the logbook marked P8. Sgt&nbsp;Sufyan testified, and I accepted, that he deposited the items or groups of items labelled “D” to “F” in the CNB store because these items – including coloured straws, bongs and lighters – were clearly not drugs. But as for the items or groups of items labelled “A” to “C” that were in the nature of a crystalline substance or a powder or pills, Sgt&nbsp;Sufyan brought them to the HSA and handed them to Ms&nbsp;Kwang around 2.51pm on 16&nbsp;July 2019. This fact was recorded in a typewritten acknowledgment receipt on the letterhead of HSA and I had no doubt that it was true.</a></p><a id="p1_82"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a><a id="p1_83">83&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms&nbsp;Kwang proceeded to test the items that had been labelled “A” and “B” while another analyst from HSA tested the items that had been labelled “C”. For purposes of the possession charge the material item was the crystalline substance that had been labelled “A”. Ms&nbsp;Kwang explained, and I accepted, that she weighed the substance and then pulverised and homogenised it into a fine powdery substance. She then took a representative sample of this fine powdery substance and analysed it. The result of her analysis, as recorded in a typewritten report dated 7&nbsp;August 2019 on the letterhead of HSA, was that the crystalline substance contained not less than 3.63g of methamphetamine.</a></p><a id="p1_83"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether it was possible that someone planted items in the accused’s room</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a><a id="p1_84">84&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused called Mr&nbsp;Frank Tan as a witness intending to establish that he – Mr&nbsp;Frank Tan – had falsely told the police that the accused had punched him. The accused alleged that Mr&nbsp;Frank Tan had had reason to do so because the accused had rejected Mr&nbsp;Frank Tan’s requests for a loan. The accused also alleged that Mr&nbsp;Frank Tan had said that he had recently been released from prison and that he had gambling issues. Although the accused did not put this to Mr&nbsp;Frank Tan directly, the insinuation was that Mr&nbsp;Frank Tan might have acted by himself or in concert with others to plant the items that were subsequently seized from the accused’s room at the Hotel.</a></p><a id="p1_84"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a><a id="p1_85">85&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Frank Tan firmly denied the accused’s allegations, and I believed his denials entirely. One significant reason for this was that the official records that Ms&nbsp;Teo obtained showed that Mr&nbsp;Frank Tan had never been convicted of a crime in his life. Thus he had never before gone to prison and there was no reason at all to think that he would have told that accused that he had been recently released from prison. Moreover, given my earlier findings in the ancillary hearing I had substantial cause to question the accused’s overall credibility, and so I was much inclined to prefer Mr&nbsp;Frank Tan’s testimony over the accused’s allegations.</a></p><a id="p1_85"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a><a id="p1_86">86&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence I found that the accused had in fact punched Mr&nbsp;Frank Tan and that this prompted Mr&nbsp;Frank Tan to call the police and report the assault. I did not think that the undisputed fact that Mr&nbsp;Frank Tan did not seek medical attention afterward made it less likely that the assault had occurred. I thought it was entirely plausible that he did not seek medical attention because no serious injury resulted from the punch. Even if I assumed, on the accused’s best case, that Mr&nbsp;Frank Tan had been unhappy because he failed to obtain a loan from the accused, for him to have been able to plant items in the accused’s room he would have had either to happen to have illicit drugs and drug-taking utensils lying around in his possession ready for deployment, or to be so animated by animosity towards the accused notwithstanding the brevity of their interactions that he would go to the trouble of acquiring these illicit items which naturally would not be sold openly. All this seemed to me inherently unlikely in the extreme. In the premises, I rejected any insinuation by the accused that Mr&nbsp;Frank Tan might have been responsible for the presence of the seized items in the accused’s room.</a></p><a id="p1_86"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a><a id="p1_87">87&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused did not suggest any other individual who might have had motive or means to plant items in his room. I did not understand him to allege that the police officers who arrested him in the room might themselves have been involved in planting those items, and in any event there was no evidence whatsoever in support of that hypothesis. Given that the accused did not identify any other possible perpetrator, I thought that the possibility that someone else might have planted the items in the room to implicate the accused falsely was utterly fanciful and unworthy of serious consideration. Therefore I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the items seized from the room had been brought there by the accused himself.</a></p><a id="p1_87"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The accused’s state of mind during his admission at CGH</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a><a id="p1_88">88&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In calling Dr&nbsp;Cheow as a witness the accused sought to show that he had a serious underlying psychiatric condition that would have affected his state of mind during his admission at CGH from 14 to 16&nbsp;July 2019. The accused’s case appeared to be that his state of mind at the time was such that he was unaware of his own actions and did not know what he was doing.</a></p><a id="p1_88"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a><a id="p1_89">89&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Dr&nbsp;Cheow’s testimony did not assist the accused. Even though the accused repeatedly put to Dr&nbsp;Cheow the proposition that he – the accused – had underlying bipolar disorder, Dr&nbsp;Cheow steadfastly disagreed and opined that, while the accused did have underlying antisocial personality disorder, any psychotic symptoms he had exhibited before were likely to have been a result of drug-induced psychosis. Furthermore, Dr&nbsp;Cheow disagreed with the accused’s suggestion that it was possible that the medication he had consumed around 1.45am on 15&nbsp;July 2019, namely quetiapine and trazadone, could have caused the accused to have been unaware of his actions when he crushed in his hands the sample bottles containing his urine around 3.30am.</a></p><a id="p1_89"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a><a id="p1_90">90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned above, Dr&nbsp;Cheow saw the accused at IMH on three occasions in 2019. He did so on 3&nbsp;June and on 5 and 26&nbsp;August. Dr&nbsp;Cheow’s clinical notes corresponding to each visit were admitted in evidence and marked D6 to D8 in chronological order.</a></p><a id="p1_90"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a><a id="p1_91">91&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found Dr&nbsp;Cheow to be a reliable and persuasive witness. As a starting point I adopted a deferential attitude towards his opinions given that he is an expert in psychiatric matters and I am not. Beyond this, I thought that he elaborated on his views in a cogent and sensible manner that demonstrated that he had applied a critical mind to the accused’s case. To illustrate, Dr&nbsp;Cheow recorded in his clinical notes dated 5&nbsp;August 2019 (marked D7) that the accused had at that visit reported hearing voices, but Dr&nbsp;Cheow did not take this at face value and did not unquestioningly accept it as a symptom of bipolar disorder or some other psychosis, and he was able to give a reason for this. He testified that the accused had been “flippant” and “frivolous”, in that he had claimed that he heard the voices “telling him that he was Dr&nbsp;Cheow and that he must come for [his appointment at IMH]”, and that such frivolity was highly inconsistent with his previous experience with patients who had genuine auditory hallucinations. Dr&nbsp;Cheow was also careful and nuanced in his testimony: after he had defined delusions as “fixed false beliefs”, the accused referred in a subsequent question to a “fake sense of reality”, whereupon Dr&nbsp;Cheow interjected to point out that false beliefs did not equate to a fake sense of reality. At the same time, Dr&nbsp;Cheow was fair to the accused and acknowledged points in the accused’s favour, for instance, that the history of schizophrenia in the accused’s family meant that there was a higher chance that the accused also suffered from it.</a></p><a id="p1_91"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a><a id="p1_92">92&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus I was strongly of the view that Dr&nbsp;Cheow had given conscientious thought to the accused’s case and had properly and impartially applied his expert psychiatric knowledge and experience to it in coming to the conclusion that the accused did not have underlying bipolar disorder. Accordingly I accepted this conclusion without reservation. Similarly I accepted without reservation his opinions on the nature and effects of the medication that the accused had taken in CGH around 1.45am on 15&nbsp;July 2019. It was evident from the clinical notes dated 3&nbsp;June 2019 that Dr&nbsp;Cheow had prescribed for the accused 200mg of quetiapine and 50mg of trazadone. Dr&nbsp;Cheow testified that both medications had been prescribed solely for purposes of sedation, that is, to help the accused sleep because he had complained of “poor sleep despite compliance to meds”. Dr&nbsp;Cheow categorically stated under examination by Ms&nbsp;Teo that taking 200mg of quetiapine and 50mg of trazadone, even in combination, would not cause the accused to enter a state of mind in which he was unaware of his actions or unable to control his actions. I saw no reason to think that this was not a correct explanation of the effects of these medications at those dosages. Hence it was clear that Dr&nbsp;Cheow’s evidence did not support any supposition that the accused might have been unaware of what he was doing or unable to control his actions when he crushed the sample bottles in his hands around 3.30am on 15 July 2019.</a></p><a id="p1_92"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a><a id="p1_93">93&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That supposition was also very much at odds with the accused’s observable behaviour at the time. Having seen the BWC video footage of events in the 30 or so seconds before the accused crushed the sample bottles, and having heard the dialogue and read the transcript of it, it seemed abundantly clear to me that the accused was acting rationally and under his own volition. He sat for some time with the sample bottles in his hands before he crushed them, ruling out the possibility that he might have experienced some automatic spasms in his hands. He was perfectly capable of carrying out a conversation with SSgt&nbsp;Lee and understanding what SSgt&nbsp;Lee said and reacting meaningfully to it. In particular, when SSgt&nbsp;Lee said that he would ask his colleague to place the sealed sample bottles beside the accused, the accused seized on the reference to “colleague” and asked whether “CNB is your colleague”. He was able to allege that SSgt&nbsp;Lee had not followed procedure and protocol in sealing the sample bottles. Although this allegation was unreasonable in my view, the point is that the accused’s ability to formulate this allegation showed that his mind was working normally, in that he was able to appreciate what was going on around him and comprehend his place in those events and the possible adverse consequences that those events might have for him in the future.</a></p><a id="p1_93"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a><a id="p1_94">94&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that when the accused crushed in his hands the sample bottles containing his urine he knew full well what he was doing and had full control over his actions. It seemed to me that the only viable inference I could draw from this was that he had crushed the sample bottles intending to prevent the urine contained therein from being tested. Therefore I found that the accused had deliberately sought to frustrate the process of procuring a urine specimen by making unusable the urine samples that he had already provided.</a></p><a id="p1_94"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision on the charges</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a><a id="p1_95">95&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given my findings from the evidence, I thought it clear that all three charges against the accused had been made out. I go on now to deal with each charge in turn.</a></p><a id="p1_95"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The possession charge</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a><a id="p1_96">96&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As explained above, I found that there was an unbroken chain of custody that connected the crystalline substance seized from the accused’s room at the Hotel to the crystalline substance that was tested by Ms&nbsp;Kwang of the HSA and was found to contain not less than 3.63g of methamphetamine. Consequently I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that there was methamphetamine in the accused’s room at the time the police officers entered it around 1.00pm on 14&nbsp;July 2019. I rejected the possibility that someone else might have been responsible for bringing the methamphetamine into the room, and hence I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was the one who had brought it into the room. It followed that he had had physical control over it.</a></p><a id="p1_96"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a><a id="p1_97">97&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the fact that the accused had brought the methamphetamine into the room I thought it a natural inference that he had known of the existence of the methamphetamine in his belongings. I saw no reason not to draw this inference. Moreover, the accused never suggested during police investigations that he had been ignorant of the existence of the methamphetamine within his physical control. On the basis of SI&nbsp;Khairil’s testimony I believed that when the accused was in the lock-up at Bedok station he was shown the items that had been seized from his room at the Hotel, including the methamphetamine, and he did not indicate any shock or surprise such as might have signalled that he had not known of the existence of any of the items among his belongings. In his statements dated 15&nbsp;July 2019, 6&nbsp;August 2019 and 24&nbsp;September 2019 he never claimed that he had been unaware of the existence of the methamphetamine. I was therefore satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had had possession of the methamphetamine while knowing full well of its existence. The <em>actus reus</em> of the possession charge was thus established.</a></p><a id="p1_97"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a><a id="p1_98">98&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the <em>mens rea</em> of the possession charge, given that it had been proven that the accused had had methamphetamine in his possession, by operation of s&nbsp;18(2) of the MDA he was presumed to have known the nature of the drug. The accused did not put forward any material to rebut that presumption. Quite the opposite, his statements positively demonstrated his knowledge that what he had had in his possession was methamphetamine. In his statement dated 15&nbsp;July 2019, when he was shown the crystalline substance that SI&nbsp;Hafiz had labelled “A”, the accused identified it as “meth” or “ice” and added that “it is meant for my own consumption”. In his statement dated 6&nbsp;August 2019, he confirmed that the crystalline substance was “meth” and that it was “meant for own consumption”. Finally, in his statement dated 24&nbsp;September 2019 (marked P22), when asked if he had anything to say in relation to the possession charge, he said only that he admitted the charge and was “very sorry” and hoped that the court would be lenient.</a></p><a id="p1_98"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a><a id="p1_99">99&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew the nature of the methamphetamine that he had had in his possession. Both the <em>actus reus</em> and the <em>mens rea</em> had been made out, and so the only course available to me was to convict the accused on the possession charge.</a></p><a id="p1_99"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The utensils charge</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a><a id="p1_100">100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given my finding that the accused had brought into the room all the items that were seized from it, including the Utensils, I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he had had the Utensils within his physical control. I saw no reason not to draw the natural inference that he had known of the existence of the Utensils among his belongings, and as with the methamphetamine, in his statements he never claimed that he had been unaware of the existence of the Utensils. Although most of the Utensils would have been innocuous items on their own – for instance, the straws and lighters – given that they were found together and with methamphetamine I had no doubt that the Utensils were in fact intended for drug consumption. Hence I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had had in his possession utensils or articles that were intended for drug consumption, and that he knew of the existence of those items. This meant that the <em>actus reus</em> of the utensils charge was established.</a></p><a id="p1_100"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a><a id="p1_101">101&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the <em>mens rea</em>, on a plain reading of s&nbsp;9 of the MDA, and bearing in mind that for the offence of drug possession the <em>mens rea</em> required is knowledge of the nature of the drug, I thought that what was required for the utensils charge was knowledge on the accused’s part of the nature of the Utensils, that is, knowledge that these were utensils or articles intended for drug consumption. On this understanding I had no doubt that the accused had such knowledge. It was not disputed that the accused had previously consumed drugs, specifically methamphetamine, and so I had no doubt that he knew what sorts of utensils or items were needed to consume methamphetamine. I thus inferred that he knew that the Utensils, in that combination, were in their nature intended for use in consuming drugs. Furthermore, the accused had admitted such knowledge in his statement dated 6&nbsp;August 2019. He said there that the items that SI&nbsp;Hafiz had labelled “D” to “F” were meant for him to smoke “meth”. His statement dated 24&nbsp;September 2019 (marked P23) also contained a tacit admission of such knowledge, in that when he was asked if he had anything to say about the utensils charge he said only that it would be the “[s]ame thing” as for the possession charge, <em>ie</em>, that he admitted the charge and was “very sorry” and hoped that the court would be lenient.</a></p><a id="p1_101"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a><a id="p1_102">102&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its written submissions the prosecution appeared to suggest a different understanding of the <em>mens rea</em> required by the utensils charge, in that the prosecution’s submission was that the accused had intended to use the Utensils to consume controlled drugs. This implied the premise that the <em>mens rea</em> was not merely knowledge of the nature of the Utensils but an actual intention to use the Utensils to consume controlled drugs. But even on this more stringent understanding of the <em>mens rea</em> I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had intended to use the Utensils to consume drugs. I inferred this from the fact that he had consumed methamphetamine before and the lack of any plausible alternative explanation for the presence of the Utensils in that specific combination of items among his belongings, and I gave due weight to his admission in his statement dated 6&nbsp;August 2019 that he intended to use the Utensils to smoke methamphetamine.</a></p><a id="p1_102"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a><a id="p1_103">103&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore it was apparent to me that both the <em>actus reus</em> and the <em>mens rea</em> of the utensils charge had been made out. Accordingly I convicted the accused on the utensils charge.</a></p><a id="p1_103"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The urine charge</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a><a id="p1_104">104&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For an offence under s&nbsp;31(2) of the MDA to occur, a police officer not below the rank of sergeant must first have required a person whom the officer “reasonably suspects” to have committed the offence of drug consumption to provide a specimen of their urine in order that a urine test might be conducted: s&nbsp;31(1) of the MDA. The offence is constituted by the failure of the person so required to provide a urine specimen without reasonable excuse “within such time as may be required” by the police officer.</a></p><a id="p1_104"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a><a id="p1_105">105&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, it could not be disputed that a police officer not below the rank of sergeant, namely Sgt&nbsp;Ong, had required the accused to provide a specimen of his urine for testing. This requirement was communicated to the accused around 6.30pm on 14&nbsp;July 2019. There was no doubt that Sgt&nbsp;Ong required the accused to do this because he suspected that the accused might have consumed illicit drugs, and I found that this suspicion was reasonable given that items that could be drugs and drug-taking utensils had been discovered in the accused’s room at the Hotel and that the accused appeared to be intoxicated even though there was no sign of alcohol consumption. Hence I accepted that Sgt&nbsp;Ong had reasonably suspected the accused to have committed the offence of drug consumption and that this was why he required the accused to provide a urine specimen. It followed that a failure by the accused to provide a urine specimen within such time as may have been required by Sgt&nbsp;Ong would constitute an offence under s&nbsp;31(2) of the MDA unless the accused had a reasonable excuse for such failure.</a></p><a id="p1_105"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a><a id="p1_106">106&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could not be disputed that by 3.30pm on 15&nbsp;July 2019 the accused had failed to provide a urine specimen – in fact he never provided a urine specimen at all. It is true that Sgt&nbsp;Ong did not expressly stipulate a time by which the accused had to provide a urine specimen. But even though s&nbsp;31(2) of the MDA contemplates that a police officer may require a person to provide a urine specimen within a specified time, I did not think that the omission to state a specified time would mean that it was impossible to commit the offence under s&nbsp;31(2) of the MDA. It seemed to me that if no time were stipulated the person would have to provide a urine specimen within a reasonable time. In this case, I regarded the period of nine hours between 6.30pm on 14 July 2019 and 3.30pm on 15 July 2019 as a wholly reasonable time. This was because it was time enough for the accused to urinate into the master bottle not once but twice, the first time to fill the master bottle to the 60ml mark and the second time to fill it to the 80ml mark. Hence I thought that the accused’s failure to provide a urine specimen by 3.30pm on 15&nbsp;July 2019 would constitute an offence unless he had a reasonable excuse.</a></p><a id="p1_106"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a><a id="p1_107">107&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused’s main defence was founded on his bladder dysfunction. There was compelling evidence that the accused likely had such dysfunction around the time of the alleged offences on 14 and 15&nbsp;July 2019. Dr&nbsp;Yam explained that the accused was first seen at the CGH Department of Urology about two years before, on 26&nbsp;July 2017, because he had symptoms suggestive of an inflammation in the bladder. The symptoms resolved by 10&nbsp;October 2017 without any significant urological problems, and there was no follow-up for a few years. But on 2&nbsp;November 2020, more than a year after the alleged offences, the accused went back to the CGH Department of Urology, and Dr&nbsp;Yam explained that the accused’s condition had by then progressed and worsened to the point where he could not even empty his bladder unassisted and needed to use a catheter. Given Dr&nbsp;Yam’s opinion that the condition of the accused’s bladder had deteriorated significantly between October 2017 and November 2020, I accepted that it was likely that the accused had had substantial bladder dysfunction by 14 and 15&nbsp;July 2019.</a></p><a id="p1_107"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a><a id="p1_108">108&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even accepting that the accused had had bladder dysfunction at the material time, I could not see how this afforded him a reasonable excuse for failing to provide a urine specimen. The simple and crucial fact was that the accused had in fact been able to pass urine notwithstanding his dysfunctional bladder. He twice urinated into the master bottle and managed to fill it to the requisite 80ml mark, and then poured the urine out into two sample bottles. The only reason why the urine that he had provided could not serve as a specimen to be tested was that he actively stymied the process by crushing the sample bottles in his hands. Therefore it was abundantly clear to me that the accused had not been incapable of providing a urine specimen. He was able but not willing to do so. It was obvious to me that an unwillingness to cooperate in the urine-testing process could not amount to a reasonable excuse.</a></p><a id="p1_108"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a><a id="p1_109">109&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not see anything else in the evidence before me that could possibly give rise to a reasonable excuse. In the circumstances I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had no reasonable excuse for his failure to provide a urine specimen within the reasonable period of nine hours between 6.30pm on 14&nbsp;July 2019 and 3.30am on 15&nbsp;July 2019 that he had had to do so, and he had thereby committed an offence under s&nbsp;31(2) of the MDA. Thus I convicted him on the urine charge.</a></p><a id="p1_109"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a><a id="p1_110">110&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was clear from the evidence that the accused had had in his possession methamphetamine and utensils intended for its consumption, and he knew of the existence of those things in his possession and of their nature. It was also clear that he had deliberately prevented his urine from being tested by crushing in his hands the sample bottles containing his urine and rendering them unusable. The straightforward conclusion was that the accused was guilty of all three charges against him. If it took a long time to reach this conclusion I am constrained to say that it was largely because the accused introduced extensive detail that was marginally relevant, if at all, to the question of his guilt or innocence on the charges. I am grateful to Ms&nbsp;Teo for maintaining her professionalism, fairness and courtesy throughout, even where the accused’s conduct at trial was less than satisfactory.</a></p><a id="p1_110"> </a></div></content></html>
