The intention behind these amendments was the segregation of the sub-provisions applicable to apprehended persons who consent to surrender in s 15A from the sub-provisions applicable to apprehended persons who do not consent to surrender in s 16, with consequential changes to the wording where necessary (see Statutes (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2022, Explanatory Statement).

Ms Fadaak went about making enquiries for a life insurance policy on the Deceased’s life even though Ms Fadaak told investigators that she was planning to leave the Deceased during an unrelated investigation with Child Protective Services. On 29 May 2019, Ms Fadaak was informed that the Deceased could not be insured as he did not have citizenship.</a></p><a id="p1_10-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_10-p2_e">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the Deceased’s death, the Deceased lived with his wife Ms Fadaak and their young child in a split level two-floor home in Kirkland, Washington. The Deceased and family occupied the upper floor while one Nelida Zuniga (“Zuniga”) and three minor children rented and resided in the lower floor. That night, Ms Fadaak slept in a room across the hall, which was not a common occurrence.</a></p><a id="p1_10-p2_e"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_e"></a><a id="p1_10-p2_f">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deceased was killed on 31 May 2019 at about 2.00 am in his residence. There were no signs of forced entry, and Al Obaidi entered the residence and attacked the Deceased while the Deceased was asleep in bed, alone. Al Obaidi stabbed the Deceased a total of approximately 30 times, causing his death.</a></p><a id="p1_10-p2_f"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_f"></a><a id="p1_10-p2_g">(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residents living downstairs were alerted by the sounds of the attack and came to investigate. Zuniga saw Al Obaidi attack the Deceased, and attempted to intervene. Al Obaidi stabbed Zuniga multiple times. The Deceased ran out of the room where he had initially been attacked, and Al Obaidi then turned to pursue the Deceased who eventually collapsed in a nearby hallway. Al Obaidi then turned to Zuniga and continued his attack on her, but the latter ultimately escaped and survived the attack, sustaining some 18 stab wounds.</a></p><a id="p1_10-p2_g"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_g"></a><a id="p1_10-p2_h">(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Zuniga, who was subsequently interviewed by investigators, Fadaak stood by, mere feet away, and quietly watched Al Obaidi attack the Deceased, making no effort to stop Al Obaidi’s attack on the Deceased. When Al Obaidi turned to attack Zuniga for the second time, Zuniga pleaded with Al Obaidi to stop. Ms Fadaak told Al Obaidi to stop, and Al Obaidi stopped his attack on Zuniga. Ms Fadaak and Al Obaidi had a calm conversation with Al Obaidi in Arabic, a language Zuniga did not speak. Zuniga fled the residence. Al Obaidi did not attempt to harm Ms Fadaak, and Ms Fadaak did not yell, scream or try to deter or stop Al Obaidi’s attack on the Deceased.</a></p><a id="p1_10-p2_h"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_h"></a><a id="p1_10-p2_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in a seemingly frantic phone call placed by Ms Fadaak to the police at about 2.10 am on the same day, Ms Fadaak claimed that somebody had come into her residence and an altercation had ensued. The dispatcher asked if Ms Fadaak recognised the person. Ms Fadaak claimed to only have seen her husband covered in blood and Zuniga, and did not mention Al Obaidi during her call to the police. Officers subsequently arrived on scene and found the Deceased. Investigators located a knife under the Deceased’s bed. Zuniga was conveyed to a hospital for surgery.</a></p><a id="p1_10-p2_i"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_i"></a><a id="p1_10-p2_j">(j)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In subsequent interviews with the Police, Ms Fadaak continued to omit mention that Al Obaidi was at the apartment at the time of the killing.

It was also subsequently established that several of the calls to the insurance companies placed by Ms Fadaak on 30 May 2019 were placed from Ms Fadaak’s apartment in Belluvue (different apartment from the one where the Deceased was killed), while Al Obaidi was in the Belluvue apartment with her, before they parted ways at about 12.00 noon. Al Obaidi remained in contact throughout the day with Ms Faak by phone between 12.36 pm and 11.18 pm on 30 May 2019. Investigators also subsequently discovered calls placed by Al Obaidi’s phone to Ms Fadaak at 2.14 and 2.29 am on 31 May 2019.

This is because the act or omission constituting the offence would, if it had taken place within Singapore, constitute an offence of criminal conspiracy to commit murder under s 300(a) read with s 120B of the Penal Code. The offence carries a maximum punishment of not less than two years and is not an excluded offence under the First Schedule to the Extradition Act. The offence which is the subject of Count 2 is an offence for which extradition shall be reciprocally granted pursuant to Art 3 of the United States of America (Extradition) Order in Council, 1935 (Cap 103, OR 1) (“United States Order in Council”).</a></p><a id="p1_20"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was held in <em>Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1998] 3 SLR(R) 0619.xml')">[1998] 3 SLR(R) 619</a> (at [75] – [76]) and affirmed more recently in <em>Er Joo Nguang and anor v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2000] 1 SLR(R) 0756.xml')">[2000] 1 SLR(R) 756</a>, that unlike criminal conspiracy as defined in s 120A of the Penal Code, abetment by conspiracy for the purposes of s 107(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Penal Code requires some further act to be done pursuant to the conspiracy, as opposed to a mere agreement to do or cause to be done an illegal act. The offence of a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence as defined in s 120A(1) of the Penal Code does not require an act to take place in pursuance to the conspiracy, and would be constituted in Singapore if the conduct that is charged under Count 2 took place within the jurisdiction of Singapore.

The argument, as I understand it, is that Ms Fadaak cannot be charged for murder under Singapore law even if the alleged acts causing death (<em>ie</em>, the stabbing of the Deceased) took place in Singapore, as these acts were performed by Al Obaidi and not Ms Fadaak.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a> It was contended for Ms Fadaak that <em>actus reus</em> is an essential element of the offence of murder in Singapore, unlike in the United States, where accomplices can be held liable as if they were the principal offender for engaging in or causing the commission of an offence by the principal offender.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State submits that the alleged conduct providing the basis for Count 1 corresponds to the offence of abetment of murder by aiding or instigation under s 300(a) read with s 109, punishable under s 302 of the Penal Code. I agree with the State’s submission, that in applying the “conduct” test as set out in <em>Wong Yuh Lan</em>, it is critical to ascertain whether the alleged conduct in the foreign State constituted an offence in Singapore. Despite purporting to apply the “conduct test”, the submission of counsel for the fugitive seemed, in actual fact, to apply the “ingredients test”, as the submission focussed rather narrowly on the correspondence of the elements constituting the offence of murder in the United States and in Singapore, rather than on whether the conduct charged would have been an offence if it had been committed in Singapore, for which extradition shall be granted.

SDA Washington’s affidavit also alluded to an intention to rely on evidence of the frequency and timing of Ms Fadaak’s communications with Mr Al Obaidi in the period leading up to the death of the Deceased, especially in the hours just before the murder. The United States also intends to rely on evidence that the Deceased’s residence was left unlocked prior to the murder, of Ms Fadaak’s uunsual decision to sleep in her child’s room instead of the bedroom she shared with the Deceased at the material time, as well as evidence that Ms Fadaak had stood by as the Deceased was attacked multiple times by Al Obaidi with a knife; and Ms Fadaak’s subsequent conduct in concealing from investigators her knowledge that Al Obaidi was the assailant.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially, the United States asserts that Ms Fadaak participated by assisting Al Obaidi in the commission of the offence of murder in the first degree, and was a part of the premeditation of the offence.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a> The United States also intends to prove Ms Fadaak’s participation in instigating the attack, given that Zuniga’s account suggests that Ms Fadaak was in a position to instruct Al Obaidi, who obeyed Ms Fadaak’s instruction to desist during the second attack on Zuniga, which the United States views as evidence that Ms Fadaak directed the attack.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conduct charged, constituting the elements stated above at [22] therefore correspond to an offence of abetment by aiding, and an offence of abetment by instigation to cause death, if committed in Singapore.

Thus, the fact that D4 showed that the charges against Al Obaidi made no mention of Ms Fadaak’s presence at the scene of the offences do not detract from the State’s case for Ms Fadaak’s extradition.</a></p><a id="p1_33"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the information provided in the United States’ request for extradition, there was evidence uncovered during investigations that satisfied the burden of adducing <em>prima facie</em> evidence of a conspiracy with Al Obaidi to commit murder of the Deceased.

Despite Ms Fadaak’s efforts, insurance coverage could not be obtained as the Deceased was not a citizen of the United States;</a></p><a id="p1_34-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_34-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Fadaak’s phone records showing contact with Al Obaidi throughout the day of the murder were deleted before Ms Fadaak showed her mobile phone to investigators in a police interview. Phone records also showed communications with various insurance companies to which she had made inquiries to obtain an insurance policy on the Deceased’s life. There was also CCTV footage that placed Al Obaidi together with Ms Fadaak in her Belluvue apartment while she placed calls to insurance companies on 30 May 2019.</a></p><a id="p1_34-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_34-p2_e">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zuniga, who survived the attack by Al Obaidi on 31 May 2019, had given statements placing Ms Fadaak at the scene of the killing, watching quietly as Al Obaidi’s attack on the Deceased took place, and conversing calmly with Al Obaidi after Zuniga was attacked by Al Obaidi. Zuniga’s statements contradicted Ms Fadaak’s statements that she did not see the Deceased’s assailant, and Ms Fadaak’s subsequent expressions of disbelief that Al Obaidi had been identified as the assailant, which could support the inference that Ms Fadaak had not been truthful with investigators to conceal her involvement in the offences charged.</a></p><a id="p1_34-p2_e"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34-p2_e"></a><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, there was <em>prima facie</em> evidence, which was not inherently incredible, of the existence of a criminal conspiracy to murder (the charge in Count 2). There was some evidence of a romantic relationship between Ms Fadaak and Al Obaidi and financial motive, as can be seen from the multiple calls with insurance companies on the Deceased’s life despite Ms Fadaak’s stated intention to leave the Deceased. The evidence that Ms Fadaak and Al Obaidi had met in Ms Fadaak’s apartment on 30 May 2019 where Ms Fadaak placed calls to insurance companies, and continued frequent communications on the day preceding the murder which Ms Fadaak sought to conceal from investigators, went towards the possible inference of a conspiracy. That there was a conspiracy to murder can also be seen from the evidence that Ms Fadaak had removed herself from the Deceased’s bedroom, which was unusual behaviour on her part. Furthermore, Zuniga’s statements revealed that Ms Fadaak had watched the killing of the Deceased by Al Obaidi, and had calm conversation with Al Obaidi who did not try to hurt her. The threads of evidence taken together, was sufficient to form a <em>prima facie</em> case that Ms Fadaak and Al Obaidi had an agreement to commit the murder of the Deceased. Accordingly, I find that the State has adduced <em>prima facie</em> evidence that Ms Fadaak had committed the conduct charged in respect of Count 2.</a></p><a id="p1_35"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State submitted that the same set of facts also form the basis for a finding that <em>prima facie</em> evidence has been adduced that Count 1 has been committed of “aiding and / instigating” the murder of the Deceased which was not inherently incredible. I queried whether it was State Counsel’s position that the same set of facts go to show both forms abetment <em>viz</em>, both aiding and instigation of murder, and if so, what was the evidence which made out each form of abetment. I queried specifically, the accuracy of State Counsel’s written submissions at [37(c)] which was repeated again in State Counsel’s reply submissions at [9(b)(i)], that investigations by the United States revealed that Ms Fadaak had assisted Al Obaidi’s commission of murder by providing the numeric code to access the Deceased apartment <em>and</em> leaving the door unlocked at the material time of the murder as the latter seemed unnecessary if the former was done.</a></p><a id="p1_36"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the queries posed, the State essentially asserts that the same set of facts, if assumed true, would also disclose two offences if committed in Singapore, <em>viz</em>, abetment by aiding <em>and</em> abetment by instigation of Al Obaidi’s murder of the Deceased. With respect to abetment of murder by aiding, I was not satisfied that there was any evidence tendered which went to show that it was Ms Fadaak who had left the door to the Deceased’s apartment unlocked at the material time in light of the number of residents in the apartment. This is because Detective Haas’ affidavit did not set out any statement or account that the Deceased’s apartment was left unlocked by Ms Fadaak just prior to the killing. Contrary to the State’s submission, the numeric code provided by Ms Fadaak to Al Obaidi was for her apartment in Belluvue, not for the Deceased’s apartment. SDA Washington’s affidavit, which asserts that there is evidence that Ms Fadaak had assisted by unlocking the upstairs portion of the Deceased’s apartment where only the Deceased, Ms Fadaak and her son resided, does not point to any evidence showing this fact.</a></p><a id="p1_37"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, I was of the view that there was sufficient evidence from which an inference could be made, and a case for Ms Fadaak to answer in respect of abetment by instigation of the murder of the Deceased. Ms Fadaak’s quiet presence during the killing of the Deceased by Al Obaidi as observed by Zuniga, as well as Ms Fadaak’s role in pursuing life insurance on the Deceased’s life shortly prior to the murder, and Al Obaidi’s demonstrated obedience of Ms Fadaak’s instruction to desist from his attack on Zuniga, altogether, could support an inference that Al Obaidi had attacked the Deceased on her instruction. Even if I was wrong, it seems to me that Al Obaidi’s attack on the Deceased was pursuant to a conspiracy between Al Obaidi and Ms Fadaak to commit murder on the Deceased. Accordingly, the conduct which forms the basis for Count 1, if transposed to Singapore, would constitute an offence of abetment of murder, under s 300(a) punishable under s 302 and read with s 109 of the Penal Code.</a></p><a id="p1_38"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For completeness, I will address the submission made for the fugitive that the inferences which the United States will seek to be made by the trial court are not sustainable (that Ms Fadaak instigated and aided the Deceased murder out of financial motivation and desire to maintain a romantic relationship with Al Obaidi) and that the veracity of Zuniga’s account that Ms Fadaak had stood by while Al Obaidi attacked the Deceased is in question<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a>.
