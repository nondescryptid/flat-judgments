Over a period of eight months from January to August 2018, when he was 16 years old, he dishonestly induced seven of his friends to deliver to him large sums of money over multiple occasions. He deceived them into believing that he would invest the monies to generate returns for them. He did not invest the monies, but used the monies instead to buy in-game items for online games, and for online gambling with the in-game items. By his deception, he cheated his friends of more than $332,000 in total. About $83,000 was given back as purported “investment returns”; but close to $249,000 remains unrecovered and unrepaid.</a></p><a id="p1_1"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven charges of cheating were brought against the defendant, under s&nbsp;420 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Revised Edition) (“<b>Penal Code</b>”).

Further, he represented that he had previously profited from trading in Bitcoin, and he guaranteed them fixed returns if they invested through him. His representations were false.

The defendant had perpetrated an investment scam. The year-on-year increase in the number of scams in Singapore underscored the need for general deterrence. Specific deterrence was also a relevant sentencing principle. The defendant had deceived a total of seven victims to deliver monies over 84 occasions. Given the multiple offences committed, he could not be considered a first-time offender but was a recalcitrant offender for which specific deterrence was warranted. Large sums of money were involved. The total amount cheated from the seven victims was $332,067. Although $82,943 was given back to the victims as returns on investment and mitigated the economic harm sustained by the victims, it was not as restitution and could not be considered a demonstration of the defendant’s remorse.

He had no antecedents. He was only 16&nbsp;years’ old at the time of the offences. He was foolish and committed the offences in a misguided attempt to gain the favour of his friends. This was an act of folly and not a representation of his character. He had cooperated fully with the authorities: he was first called up by the police for investigations around four years ago, and had cooperated with the investigations since then. He was genuinely remorseful for his actions. He had also been enlisted for National Service, and had learnt to be more disciplined through his time in National Service. He was committed to becoming a better person, and had taken proactive steps to better himself, and to find ways to make better use of his time by giving back to society.

At the first stage of the sentencing process, the task for the court is to identify and prioritise the primary sentencing considerations appropriate to the youth in question having regard to all the circumstances including those of the offence.

That said, the offences were serious in nature and caused substantial harm to the victims. Over a period of about eight months between January and August 2018, he deceived seven of his friends into handing over large sums of money, totalling more than $332,000 over at least 84 occasions. These were not one-off offences, but involved conduct that was persistent and premeditated. The victims suffered very heavy losses for which they have not been compensated, and a large amount of more than $249,000 remained outstanding. Accordingly, <em>deterrence</em> and <em>retribution</em> were relevant considerations that ought to be factored into the sentencing decision as well. The offences were not so heinous, however, that rehabilitation was completely displaced as a sentencing consideration. I therefore accepted the submission of the prosecution that it would be appropriate to call for pre-sentence reports for both probation and RT. Both reports were called for at the plead-guilty mention on 16 August 2022, and the case was adjourned for sentencing on a later date pending the pre-sentence reports.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendant was recommended for probation and also found suitable for RT:</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_24-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the <em>Probation Officer’s Report</em> dated 23 September 2022 (the “<b>Probation Report</b>”), the defendant was recommended for probation. It was recommended that he undergo supervised probation for 21&nbsp;months with the following conditions: a time restriction of 10&nbsp;pm to 6&nbsp;am, to perform 80 hours of community service, and for his parents to be bonded to ensure his good behaviour.</a></p><a id="p1_24-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_24-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the <em>Pre-Sentencing Report for Reformative Training</em> dated 19&nbsp;September 2022 (the “<b>RT Report</b>”), the defendant was found to be physically and mentally fit to undergo the RT regime. It was stated that: “[the defendant] would benefit from intervention targeting his poor decision making and problem-solving skills. He would also benefit from follow up in the community to support and maintain his abstinence from gambling.” The recommendation was that the defendant undergo “Level 1 intensity of rehabilitation” if sentenced to RT.</a></p><a id="p1_24-p2_b"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Appropriate sentence: reformative training</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prosecution submitted that the defendant should be ordered to undergo RT at level 1 intensity.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a> While the dominant sentencing consideration was rehabilitation as the defendant was a young offender below the age of 21, RT was more suitable as there was an enhanced need for deterrence. There had been a disturbing rise in scams, including investment scams, and underscored the need for general deterrence. The present case involved a series of investment scams perpetuated on seven victims, involving staggering sums totalling $332,067. There was also a need for specific deterrence. The defendant’s offending was persistent and premeditated, and the victims were cheated over an extended period of time and deceived into delivering monies numerous times. Although the defendant was untraced, he could not be treated as a first-time offender. The sum of $82,943 given back to some of the victims as purported returns on their purported investments must be accorded minimal mitigatory weight as it did not represent true restitution or an act of remorse. In any event, the outstanding loss to the seven victims was $249,124. Both the degree of harm caused by the defendant and the degree of his criminal benefit were high. There was thus a need for deterrence with an overarching focus and emphasis of rehabilitation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence submitted that probation would best fulfil the aims of the defendant’s rehabilitation.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a> Given his personal circumstances and environment, RT would be disruptive and detrimental to his rehabilitation. A sentence of RT would result in a criminal record, which would be a blemish on his future. The favourable conditions for rehabilitation outside institutionalised custody made RT a disproportionately harsh sentence. The defendant was not a hardened criminal. RT would increase the risk of him being exposed to bad influences, and would remove him from his present social environment, which was conducive to his rehabilitation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In deciding on the appropriate sentence, I accepted that rehabilitation was a dominant sentencing consideration given the defendant’s young age. (This was a point that was not in dispute.) The offences were committed in 2018 when he was about 16 years old, and he had not reoffended. I was prepared to accept the submission of the defence that there had been positive changes in the defendant’s life, and his rehabilitative prospects were good.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a> This was borne out by the positive recommendation in the Probation Report, and also from the fact that the RT Report recommended that a level 1 intensity of rehabilitation would suffice (rather than a level 2 intensity). Had rehabilitation been the sole sentencing consideration, I would have had no hesitation in making a probation order as suggested by counsel.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I also considered deterrence and retribution to be relevant sentencing considerations (above, at [23]). In my judgment, an order of probation would not adequately address the need for deterrence and retribution. The deterrent effect of a probation order would be “penumbral at best”: <em>PP v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 1 SLR(R) 0449.xml')"></a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 1 SLR(R) 0449.xml')">[2008] 1&nbsp;SLR(R) 449</a> (“<b><em>Al-Ansari</em></b>”) at [55].

The sentencing option that would better meet the rehabilitative needs of the defendant as an individual, while fulfilling the public interest demands of deterrence and retribution, would be reformative training.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was explained in <em>Al-Ansari</em> at [58], RT would provide “a middle ground that broadly encapsulates the twin principles of rehabilitation and deterrence in relation to young offenders”. In the course of seeking the right balance between rehabilitation and deterrence, “rehabilitation as a dominant consideration does not inevitably mean probation orders”: <em>Al-Ansari</em> at [63].

[…]</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence raised a concern that a sentence of RT would be disruptive and detrimental to the defendant’s rehabilitation, and increase the risk of his being exposed to bad influences. While such risks have been recognised, for example in <em>PP&nbsp;v&nbsp;Justin&nbsp;Heng&nbsp;Zheng Hao</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2012] SGDC 0219.xml')">[2012] SGDC 219</a> at [27] and <em>Praveen s/o Krishnan v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21718-SSP.xml')">[2018] 3 SLR 1300</a> at [63], it cannot preclude the court from imposing such a sentence where it was warranted by the gravity of the offending conduct and the harm caused, as in the present case. It has been observed that “reformative training allows the courts to sentence the offender to a rehabilitative programme under a structured environment while avoiding the danger of exposing the young offender to the potentially unsettling influence of an adult prison environment” and RT is “the preferred sentencing option in cases where a degree of deterrence is desired”: <em>PP v Koh Wen Jie Boaz</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18361-SSP.xml')">[2016] 1 SLR 334</a> at [38], [39]; see also <em>PP v Ong Jack Hong</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19524-SSP.xml')">[2016] 5 SLR 166</a> at [14].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accepted the recommendation in the RT Report that a level 1 intensity of rehabilitation would be appropriate. I was satisfied, having regard to the defendant’s character (which was amenable to rehabilitation) and the circumstances of the offences (which were serious and caused substantial harm), that to reform him and to prevent him from committing further crime, he should undergo RT. The preconditions for a sentence of RT, under s 305 of the CPC, had been met. I did not accept the submission of the defence that RT would be a disproportionately harsh sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_31"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentence imposed</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the defendant was sentenced to RT with a minimum period of detention of 6&nbsp;months, in accordance with the recommendations in the RT Report.
