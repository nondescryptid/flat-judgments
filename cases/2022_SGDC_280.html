When the Plaintiff was transferred to JCH, she was initially admitted into an eight-bed ward at Ward C8, Bed 24. Subsequently, on or around 28 March 2017, the Plaintiff suffered from an infection that required her to be isolated, and she was transferred to a single bed isolation room at Ward C8, Bed 14 (the “<b>Room</b>”)<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Room was a double-barrel room, <em>i.e.</em> it had two consecutive doors. The inner room, where the bed was situated, had doors which led to another room which had another set of doors which led to the corridor of the ward. One had to walk through two sets of doors to move from the inner room to the corridor of the ward. The Room had: (a) a call bell that was hanging from the bed; (b) a visitor’s chair (the “<b>Visitor’s Chair</b>”); (c) a larger chair (the “<b>geriatric chair</b>”) and (d) a table on rollers that had an adjustable height (the “<b>cardiac table</b>”)<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During her hospitalisation at JCH, the Plaintiff was recorded as being a patient at risk of falling and that precautions needed to be taken to ensure that she did not fall. The Plaintiff scored 50 on the Morse Fall Risk Assessment on 10 April 2017 prior to the Fall, and on all days leading up to the Fall when the assessment was conducted, except on two days. The two days were 20 March 2017 and 1 April 2017, when the Plaintiff scored 40 on the Morse Fall Risk Assessment<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a>. The Morse Fall Risk Assessment is a worldwide assessment through which a patient’s risk for falls is assessed.

Patient Care Assistant Myat Swe Zin Myint (“<b>Ms Myat</b>”) attended to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff informed Ms Myat that she needed to use the toilet. Ms Myat proceeded to transfer the Plaintiff to the toilet on a commode chair, where she assisted the Plaintiff with her oral hygiene care and a shower.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Ms Myat was still assisting the Plaintiff in the toilet, another nurse entered the room and placed the Plaintiff’s breakfast on the cardiac table<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sequence of events after this was severely disputed. What was undisputed was that after the Plaintiff exited the toilet accompanied by Ms Myat, she proceeded to have her breakfast (though the location where she had her breakfast was disputed). Ms Myat thereafter left the room. At or around 0835 hours, Staff Nurse Hou Wenfeng (“<b>SN Hou</b>”) entered the Room to give the Plaintiff, who was by then sitting on the Visitor’s Chair, her medication. SN Hou left the Room less than five minutes later. The Plaintiff was left seated in the Visitor’s Chair in the Room alone. After SN Hou left the Room, no one else entered the Room until after the Plaintiff’s Fall.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At around 0900 hours, a staff nurse noticed a call bell alert coming from the Plaintiff’s room. Upon entering the Room, the staff nurse found the Plaintiff lying on the floor. The Plaintiff complained of pain at her left hip. More nurses entered the room and transferred the Plaintiff to the bed. The Plaintiff’s vital signs and oxygen saturation level were checked and noted to be stable. The ward doctor, Dr Yong Kuan Yew, was alerted to review the Plaintiff.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On examination, Dr Yong found the Plaintiff’s left lower limb to be externally rotated. No other external injuries were seen, and the Plaintiff complained of pain over her left hip. An X-ray of the left hip was ordered and revealed that the P had sustained an intertrochanteric fracture of the left proximal femur.</a></p><a id="p1_17"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff was referred to the NTFGH Orthopaedic team for further treatment and management of the fracture. She subsequently underwent a left hip fracture fixation surgery at NTFGH on 11 April 2017. The Plaintiff’s post-operative recovery was uneventful and she continued to received medical, nursing and rehabilitative care at NTFGH until her transfer to St Luke’s Hospital on 18 April 2017<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Plaintiff’s version of the events</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff’s version of the events leading up to the Fall, as adapted from the Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions (“<b>PCS</b>”), were as follows.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff asserted that after Ms Myat had finished assisting the Plaintiff with her toileting needs, Ms Myat assisted the Plaintiff from her bed to the Visitor’s Chair in the Room, where the Plaintiff had her breakfast. The Plaintiff’s breakfast was placed on the cardiac table. The Visitor’s Chair was placed on the left side of the bed, away from the window, and was approximately one metre away from the bed. According to the Plaintiff, the bed was not within the Plaintiff’s reach from the Visitor’s Chair. Ms Myat left the Room after seating the Plaintiff on the Visitor’s Chair for her breakfast<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When SN Hou came in to give the Plaintiff her medication, she saw the Plaintiff on the Visitor’s Chair. Other than giving Plaintiff her medication, SN Hou did not interact with the Plaintiff. In particular, SN Hou made no effort to move the Plaintiff back to the bed after serving the Plaintiff her medication and clearing her plates<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 0840 hours, the Plaintiff had been seated in the same position in the Visitor’s Chair for quite some time. She started to feel immense and unbearable pain in her back. There was no one in the Room and no one came back to check on her. She tried to reach out whilst seated to press the emergency call bell (the “<b>call bell</b>”) for assistance. However, the call bell was placed on the bed, approximately one metre away, and was out of her reach. Unable to press the call bell for assistance, she shouted for help, but no one responded<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime at or around 0850 hours, the Plaintiff’s back pain continued to worsen and it became intolerable for her to stay seated in the same position any longer. By this time, no one had come to her aid and the Plaintiff did not know how long it would be until someone would come into the Room. As the pain was unbearable, and the call bell was out of her reach, the Plaintiff slowly pushed the cardiac table away from her and stood up from the Visitor’s Chair to move to the bed so that she could rest. The Plaintiff held onto the left side of the Visitor’s Chair to stand up. However, as the Visitor’s Chair was not sturdy enough, she lost her balance and fell together with the Visitor’s Chair onto her left side<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon falling to the floor, the Plaintiff shouted in pain and cried for help. No one came to her aid. As she was unable to stand up after the Fall, she crawled towards the call bell that was on the bed with much difficulty. She pulled the cord of the call bell that was hanging against the side of the bed close to the floor. The call bell fell to the floor and she pressed the call bell at or around 0855 hours<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Plaintiff, approximately 10 to 15 minutes later, a nurse came into the Room and saw the Plaintiff on the floor. She left the Room and returned with some other nurses who then transferred the Plaintiff from the floor to the bed<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fall was not witnessed by anyone. However, the Plaintiff related the events surrounding the Fall to her son V Thiruchelvam (“<b>Thiruchelvam</b>”) at around 1040 hours, about an hour and half after the incident on the same day. Thiruchelvam affirmed an affidavit narrating the information provided to him by the Plaintiff about the Fall<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Defendant’s version of the events</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant’s version of the events leading up to the Fall was that at around 0810 hours, Ms Myat assisted the Plaintiff back to her bed to have her breakfast after assisting the Plaintiff with her toileting needs. As the Plaintiff indicated that she wanted to have her breakfast sitting up at the side of the bed, Ms Myat respected her wishes and positioned the cardiac table, with her breakfast on it, in front of the Plaintiff, with Plaintiff seated at the side of the bed<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a>. Ms Myat testified that the location on the bed where Plaintiff was seated and the relative positions of the bed, the cardiac table, the call bell, and the Visitor’s Chair were as depicted in the photograph exhibited to her affidavit at Bundle of Affidavits of Evidence In Chief (“<b>BA</b>”) page 253<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>. Based on the photograph, the Visitor’s Chair was immediately next to the bed, a very short distance from where the Plaintiff was seated. Ms Myat deposed that she placed the call bell on the bed next to the Plaintiff, where it was visible to her and within her reach.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving the Plaintiff’s room, Ms Myat instructed the Plaintiff to press the call bell whenever she needed assistance. Ms Myat remembered the Plaintiff acknowledging this instruction and nodding her head in response<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At around 0840 hours, SN Hou entered the Room and saw that the Plaintiff was no longer sitting in bed, but was instead sitting on the Visitor’s Chair beside the bed with the cardiac table in front of her, at an angle. SN Hou’s depiction of the relative positions of where the Plaintiff was seated, the Visitor’s Chair, the cardiac table and the bed are as shown in the photograph exhibited to SN Hou’s affidavit at BA 186<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a>. Again, the Visitor’s Chair was shown to be immediately next to the bed, less than one metre away contrary to the Plaintiff’s contention. According to the Defendant, it was likely that the Plaintiff had self-transferred herself from the bed to the Visitor’s Chair without any assistance. SN Hou ensured the Plaintiff had consumed the medications served to her and thereafter cleared the breakfast tray.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving the Plaintiff’s room, SN Hou checked that the call bell was at the side of the bed and within the Plaintiff’s reach without her having to stand up from the Visitor’s Chair. She reminded the Plaintiff to press the call bell if she needed any assistance, to which the Plaintiff replied “OK”. To ensure the Plaintiff understood her instructions, she gestured to the call bell and spoke to the Plaintiff in simple English<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At around 9.00am, the call alert from the Room was activated.</a></p><a id="p1_31"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Parties’ Case</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was common ground that given the Plaintiff was under the care of JCH, JCH owed a duty of care, both tortious and contractual, to the Plaintiff.

The Defendant’s case was that it had provided reasonable nursing care to the Plaintiff with appropriate fall prevention measures duly implemented.

Ultimately, it was the Plaintiff’s failure to comply with these measures and instructions that resulted in her fall<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant further submitted that when evaluating whether JCH had met the requisite standard of care, the Court must consider the reasonableness of its staff’s actions with reference only to the facts that were known at the material time.

The following extract of the Court of Appeal’s judgment elaborating on hindsight and outcome bias was cited by Defendant’s Counsel:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“This is evidently more likely to occur when doctors make judgments on the appropriateness of care by other doctors being aware of what subsequently transpired, with one study suggesting that it was not just the willingness to make judgments but the harshness of judgments that increased when there had been an adverse or severe outcome… It has also been suggested that both forms of bias are not only influential in medical expert reports but can also directly influence the decisions of lawyers and judges...”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Court of Appeal’s observations were made in the context of decisions and judgments made by doctors, the Defendant submitted that the same would logically apply when judgments are required to be made by this court on the appropriateness of care by nurses, and when evaluating the actions taken by JCH’s nursing staff at the material time<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues to be determined in the present case can be grouped under the following headings:</a></p><a id="p1_42"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42"></a><a id="p1_42-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether Ms Myat transferred the Plaintiff from the bed to the Visitor’s Chair or whether the Plaintiff self-transferred herself to the Visitor’s Chair?

With these preliminary observations, I turn now to the issues.</a></p><a id="p1_43"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Plaintiff was transferred to the Visitor’s Chair by Ms Myat or whether the Plaintiff self-transferred to the Visitor’s Chair</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a><a id="p1_44">44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned, the Plaintiff’s and the Defendant’s version of events, in so far as they related to whether Ms Myat had carried Plaintiff to the Visitor’s Chair, or whether Plaintiff had self-ambulated to the Visitor’s Chair herself, were diametrically opposed.</a></p><a id="p1_44"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a><a id="p1_45">45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (“<b>AEIC</b>”), Ms Myat deposed that after the Plaintiff completed her toileting needs, she assisted Plaintiff back to her bed for breakfast. Ms Myat asserted that she would normally wait for the patient to lie on the bed. She would then put up the bedrails, and position the cardiac table in front of the patient so that the patient can have his or her breakfast on bed. However, on 10 April 2017, the Plaintiff indicated that she did not want the bedrails to be put up, and that she wanted to eat her breakfast sitting up at the side of the bed. Respecting Plaintiff’s wishes, Ms Myat then made sure that the Plaintiff was seated comfortably at the side of the bed and positioned the cardiac table with her breakfast on it in front of her, and locked the cardiac table in place: see BA 248. Ms Myat left shortly thereafter.</a></p><a id="p1_45"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a><a id="p1_46">46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At around 0840 hours, SN Hou entered the Room and saw that the Plaintiff was no longer sitting in bed, but was instead sitting in the Visitor’s Chair beside the bed with the cardiac table in front of her. According to the Defendant, the Plaintiff in all likelihood self-transferred from the bed to the Visitor’s Chair without any assistance. Defendant relied on paragraph 8 of Ms Myat’s AEIC where she stated that, “<em>I am very certain that I did not transfer the Plaintiff from the bed to the visitor’s chair”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></em></a><em><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></em>. During her testimony in Court, Ms Myat explained that her certainty stemmed from the fact that she was trained to sit the patient on the geriatric chair if the patient wanted to sit, as that was safer for the patient<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>. Ms Myat emphasized that “<em>I left her</em> [<em>i.e. the Plaintiff] on the bed.”</em><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>. When Plaintiff’s counsel put to her that Plaintiff’s instructions to him were that the nurses had assisted her from the bed to the Visitor’s Chair, Ms Myat’s firm response was – “<em>I totally not agree.”</em><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> Ms Myat was unwavering in her testimony.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47">47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff, on the other hand, contended that Ms Myat had in fact carried the Plaintiff from her bed to the Visitor’s Chair. Plaintiff’s Counsel submitted that the Plaintiff could not have successfully completed a self-transfer from the bed to the Visitor’s Chair as she was unable to ambulate independently as she was recovering from a fracture of her left femur, and further since the Visitor’s Chair was one metre away from the bed. The Plaintiff also pointed out that Senior Nurse Manager Arvinder Kaur had agreed, during cross-examination, that the Plaintiff was “not in a position” to ambulate herself to move from the bed to the visitor’s chair on her own”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48">48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plaintiff’s Counsel further argued that the Plaintiff could not have independently transferred herself from the bed to the Visitor’s Chair as she would not have been able to unlock the wheels of the cardiac table, move the same to the Visitor’s Chair and lock the wheels in place.</a></p><a id="p1_48"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">My findings on the dispute of fact </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a><a id="p1_49">49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having regard to the evidence as a whole, I found that the Plaintiff had not shown, on a balance of probabilities, that her account of how she came to be seated on the Visitor’s Chair was to be preferred. I considered the following.</a></p><a id="p1_49"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a><a id="p1_50">50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I found that the Plaintiff had not shown on a balance of probabilities that the Visitor’s Chair was in fact one metre away from the bed at the material time. The Plaintiff’s contention that it was so was based on no more than the Plaintiff’s bare assertions. The photographs tendered by the Defendant illustrating the layout of the Room showed the Visitor’s Chair as being very close to the bed, and certainly less than one metre away from it – see BA 265, 266, 272 and 275.</a></p><a id="p1_50"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a><a id="p1_51">51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff argued that the above-mentioned photographs were taken much later and therefore did not accurately represent the actual distance of the Visitor’s Chair from the bed at the time of the Plaintiff’s fall. I was not persuaded by the Plaintiff’s arguments. If the Plaintiff’s contention that the Visitor’s Chair was one metre away from the bed were correct, then that would place the Visitor’s Chair directly in front of the sink, in the middle of nowhere. In fact, it would be in the path of the curtains surrounding the bed (which may need to be drawn from time to time), and would further be obstructing the entrance to the ensuite bathroom: see BA 272. On a balance of probabilities, I found it likely that the Visitor’s Chair was in the position depicted in BA 265, 266, 272 and 275, as testified by Ms Myat. The Visitor’s Chair was accordingly significantly less than 1 metre from the bed.</a></p><a id="p1_51"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a><a id="p1_52">52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Plaintiff contended that she could not have moved the cardiac table on her own to self-ambulate to the Visitor’s Chair as the cardiac table was locked. However, Ms Myat testified that it would not require much strength for the cardiac table to be swung out of the way<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a>. The cardiac table was designed so that only two out of the four wheels could be locked. Hence, the cardiac table could be swung out of way if it were pushed against the side where the wheels could not be locked. Senior Nurse Manager Arvinder Kaur’s (“<b>Ms Kaur</b>”) affidavit corroborated Ms Myat’s testimony by enclosing a video clip which showed how a cardiac table of the same model as that used by the Plaintiff could be swung out of the way in a locked position as described by Ms Myat<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>. Indeed, by the Plaintiff’s own account, she was able to “slowly push the cardiac table away” when she wanted to move back to her bed: see paragraph [24] of the Plaintiff’s affidavit at BA 7.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53">53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Plaintiff’s Counsel highlighted the fact that there was no evidence that Plaintiff had ambulated independently during her stay at JCH, and that Plaintiff was consistently being assessed as requiring “one man assistance”. Plaintiff’s Counsel pointed out that Ms Kaur had, during cross-examination, testified that Plaintiff was “not in a position” to self-ambulate from the bed to the Visitor’s Chair.</a></p><a id="p1_53"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a><a id="p1_54">54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding Plaintiff’s Counsel’s arguments, I found persuasive Defendant’s Counsel response that Plaintiff had been recovering from her surgery at NTFH since her surgery on 13 March 2017. The Fall occurred on 10 April 2017, about one month later. By then, the Plaintiff had been undergoing daily physiotherapy and occupational therapy sessions at NTFGH and subsequently at JCH for several weeks: see Statement of Claim (“<b>SOC</b>”) at [6]; and Defence at [6(b)]. In fact, Plaintiff’s daughter was told that Plaintiff’s expected date of discharge from JCH was on 10 April 2017 itself, “or in the next day or two”: see BA 17 at [17]. This suggested that Plaintiff’s rehabilitation had achieved progress. As Ms Myat testified during cross-examination, the Plaintiff was on “minimum assistance” at the material time, which meant that “she can transfer but not stable, and [if] she try [to ambulate from the bed to the visitor’s chair] herself, she can [do so].<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a> This was especially so as the distance between her bed and the Visitor’s Chair was very near. I found that while the Plaintiff might still not be completely stable, it was not completely impossible or implausible that Plaintiff would feel confident enough to transfer herself to the Visitor Chair which was just next to the bed where she could sit upright.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55">55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Ms Kaur’s comments, I accepted Defendant’s Counsel’s submissions that, read in its proper context, what Ms Kaur meant when she said Plaintiff was “not in a position” to self-ambulate was that it was not “prudent” for the Plaintiff to do so, and not that it was impossible for her to do so.</a></p><a id="p1_55"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a><a id="p1_56">56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For completeness, I should deal briefly with Plaintiff’s Counsel’s argument that Plaintiff had told her son, Thirulchelvam, that: (a) she was left on the Visitor’s Chair; (b) she began to suffer unbearable back pain; (c) the call bell was not placed within her reach; and (d) she tried to get up from the Visitor’s Chair to go to her bed but fell. Plaintiff’s Counsel submitted that these were deposed to by Thiruchelvam in his affidavit<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a>, but Defendant’s Counsel chose not to cross-examine Thiruchelvam on the same, and hence the affidavit was unchallenged evidence. I disagreed. Thiruchelvam was not around at the time of the Plaintiff’s Fall and did not personally witness the Fall. His account of how the Fall occurred was as narrated to him by his mother, and thus amounted to hearsay evidence. Any weight to be ascribed to his testimony on how the fall occurred, if at all, would be minimal. Indeed, the Plaintiff was called as a witness at trial. How she fell should therefore be evaluated primarily based on the Plaintiff’s first-hand account in court.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Plaintiff and Ms Myat’s credibility</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57">57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the factual dispute of whether Plaintiff was left on the Visitor’s Chair by Ms Myat (as the Plaintiff contended) or self-ambulated to the Visitor’s Chair herself (as the Defendant contended) ultimately involved the Plaintiff’s words against Ms Myat’s words, it was also important for me to assess the credibility of the two witnesses.</a></p><a id="p1_57"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Ms Myat’s credibility</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a><a id="p1_58">58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having observed Myat on the stand and considered her evidence as a whole, I found Myat to be a candid and credible witness. Myat was unwavering in her testimony that she did not transfer, and would never have transferred, the Plaintiff to the Visitor’s Chair. She candidly stated that if Plaintiff wanted to sit on a chair, she would have placed her on the geriatric chair instead and not the Visitor’s Chair, as the former was much safer. She testified that she personally would not have allowed the Plaintiff to <em>remain</em> on the Visitor’s Chair if she had seen Plaintiff seated on it, even though this aspect of her testimony was not helpful to the Defence:</a></p><a id="p1_58"> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2" frame="none" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="10.78%"><col

She then claimed that the table cannot be pushed, but eventually stated that she “<em>pushed the table like this and then I fell</em>”. A few questions later, Plaintiff claimed that there was no table in the room. Subsequently she demonstrated putting her hand on the table and leaning on it with her elbow, but when asked if she was referring to the table, Plaintiff responded that “<em>it was the chair that I put my hand</em>”.

Senior Nurse Manager Arvinder Kaur testified that there was nothing wrong <em>per se</em> for Plaintiff to wish to remain on the Visitor’s Chair. Whether the Plaintiff ought to be allowed to remain on the Visitor’s Chair depended on the circumstances of each case. This was especially so if the Plaintiff did not highlight any problems while remaining on the Visitor’s Chair, did not request to be moved back to the bed, and appeared to be familiar with seeking help by activating the call bell should she wish to be shifted back to the bed:</a></p><a id="p1_70"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>NE 31 March 2022, p 38-40 (Re-examination of Ms Kaur)</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, your response to that question by the plaintiff’s counsel was that it depends on the circumstances at the time and it depends on the situation.

Plaintiff’s counsel read this provision to you where it says that: “You have to observe patients who are at high-risk of fall vigilantly, if possible, to have a nurse or request a family member or caregiver to stay and accompany the patient in the cubicle at all times.” And you had explained that this would be applicable to a non-cooperative patient.

It was not the Plaintiff’s being seated at the Visitor’s Chair <em>per se</em> that was the issue. The Plaintiff did not fall off or fall out of the Visitor’s Chair. The Plaintiff fell because she attempted to self-transfer from the chair to the bed without calling for assistance.</a></p><a id="p1_71"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a><a id="p1_72">72&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agreed with Defendant’s Counsel<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a> that it was important to guard against hindsight bias and outcome bias, and to consider the reasonableness of SN Hou’s actions with reference only to the facts that were known at the material time. With the benefit of hindsight and knowing that Plaintiff subsequently suffered a fall when she tried to self-transfer from the Visitor’s Chair to the bed, it would be tempting to jump to the conclusion that SN Hou ought to have transferred Plaintiff back to the bed when she saw her on the Visitor’s Chair. However, based on my findings (see below) that: - (a) Plaintiff did not display any obvious signs of discomfort during the four minutes SN Hou was present in the Room; (b) the Plaintiff appeared to be sitting “comfortably” in the Visitor’s chair; (c) the Plaintiff had a track record of being a cooperative patient who readily sought help by activating the call bell when she needed assistance; and (d) SN Hou had ensured that the call bell was left within the Plaintiff’s reach - I found that the fact that SN Hou had allowed the Plaintiff to remain seated on the Visitor’s Chair did not fall below the standard of care required of her in the circumstances.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether Plaintiff was suffering from unbearable back pain </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73">73&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to SN Hou’s testimony that the Plaintiff appeared to be seated “comfortably” on the chair when she did her medication rounds, Plaintiff asserted that the reason she decided to shift back to the bed was because her back pain had become unbearable, and she could not reach the call bell for assistance.

The medical records document numerous instances where she had complained of pain at her right leg and knee, right hip, right thigh, stomach and over the chest wall. There was, however, no documented complaint of the Plaintiff having pain in her back in any of the medical records. Indeed, when asked during cross-examination if she had told the nurses or the doctors about her back pain, Plaintiff answered that she did not<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a>:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>NE 30 March 2022, p 32 (Cross-examination of Plaintiff)</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did you com---did you tell the nurses or the doctors about your back pain?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75">75&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was consistent with SN Hou’s testimony during cross examination that while Plaintiff had requested for a plaster for her middle back when SN Hou was serving her medications on the morning of 10 April 2017, Plaintiff did not complain of pain to her back<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a>:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>NE 10 May 2022, p 15 (Cross-examination of Ms Hou)</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Hou, would you have administered this plaster if not for a complaint from the patient that she was experiencing pain on her back?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I can recall the time I never really noticed the patient complained of pain or on her back, but she just request the plaster, I just give.</em> Because when we do the plaster, some patient will always ask for standby or extra.

What was, however, not highlighted by counsel was that the same medical record suggested that the “pain descriptor” was one of “aching/discomfort” only. Furthermore, the pain score was only indicated at “1”: see Agreed Bundle of Documents Volume II (“<b>2AB</b>”) at p. 341.</a></p><a id="p1_76"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a><a id="p1_77">77&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, and more significantly, SN Hou was dispensing medication to Plaintiff and was in the Room from 0835 hours till around 0839 hours. According to Plaintiff, she had been sitting at the Visitor’s Chair since 0800 hours<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a>. Her fall occurred at around 0853 hours. If the reason the Plaintiff decided to self-ambulate to the bed was because of her unbearable back pain, then it was curious why she did not alert SN Hou as to her back pain and sought SN Hou’s assistance to transfer her back to her bed, when SN Hou was in the isolation room till as late as 0839 hours that morning. Surely, Plaintiff’s severe back pain, if true, would have manifested itself after she sat on the Visitor’s Chair for close to 40 minutes. Plaintiff was further not one who would shy from seeking assistance, judging from the 297 calls she made on the call bell from her date of admission to JCH up to the time of her Fall. That she did not ask SN Hou to assist her back to the bed undermined her story that she was suffering from severe back pain at the material time.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78">78&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the foregoing, I agreed with Defendant’s Counsel that Plaintiff’s claim of unbearable back pain was an afterthought concocted to plug the gap in her case and provide a justification for her attempt to self-transfer from the visitor’s chair to the bed, which was the real cause of her fall<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the call bell was within reach at all times</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79">79&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned, I agreed with Defendant’s Counsel that the more pertinent issue when assessing if Defendant met the standard of care was whether the call bell was left within the Plaintiff’s reach, so that Plaintiff could readily call for assistance when she wanted to move from the Visitor’s Chair back to her bed. As previously noted, the Plaintiff was familiar with using the call bell, and by all accounts had no reservations calling for assistance when she needed it by pressing the call bell.</a></p><a id="p1_79"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a><a id="p1_80">80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, the Plaintiff’s claim that the call bell was left out of her reach was based on no more than her bare assertions. I accepted Ms Myat’s testimony that when she left Plaintiff after serving her breakfast, she made sure the call bell was within Plaintiff’s reach. I also accepted SN Hou’s testimony that when she observed and left Plaintiff to sit on the Visitor’s Chair, she ensured that the call bell was within reach. Leaving a call bell within a patient’s reach was one of the most routine thing that would operate in the mind of a nurse, and there was simply no reason for <em>both</em> Ms Myat and SN Hou to have omitted to do so on this particular occasion. Indeed, Ms Myat and SN Hou’s testimonies in this regard (<em>i.e.</em> that they have left the call bell near to the Plaintiff) were consistent.</a></p><a id="p1_80"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a><a id="p1_81">81&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, I had found that the position of the Visitor’s Chair that Plaintiff was sitting on at the material time was right next to the bed, as depicted in the photographs at BA 265, 266, 272 and 275. If the call bell was indeed left on the bed (as Plaintiff contended), the Plaintiff simply needed to lean over to reach for the call bell if she needed assistance. There was no reason why the Plaintiff could not have reached it. In my mind, even if the Plaintiff could not reach the body of call bell device itself, she ought not have had problems reaching the <em>chord</em> of the call bell which hung from the bed.</a></p><a id="p1_81"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a><a id="p1_82">82&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viewed as a whole, I did not find the Plaintiff’s contention that Ms Myat and/or SN Hou left the call bell out of her reach probable. I agreed with Defendant’s Counsel that while the Defendant hospital could take/implement all precautionary measures for vulnerable patients (<em>e.g.</em> having a call bell and providing transfer assistance), the cooperation of the patient was needed to avail of these measures. If these measures were provided but the patient chose not to use them, then any fall on the part of the patient did not without more point to negligence on the part of the hospital.</a></p><a id="p1_82"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether Defendant failed to monitor Plaintiff adequately, including by not having CCTVs installed in the isolation room </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a><a id="p1_83">83&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agreed with Defendant that there was no lack of attention or nursing care given to Plaintiff on the morning of 10 April 2017 before her Fall.</a></p><a id="p1_83"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a><a id="p1_84">84&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Myat had responded to Plaintiff’s call at around 0740 hours on 10 April 2017 and assisted Plaintiff with her toileting needs.

The cost-benefit analysis of having in place such a stringent requirement was also not clearly established. Indeed, if this were the standard of care required, all healthcare institutions would be required to hire sufficient trained staff to watch each camera feed round-the-clock for each isolation room where such a camera is installed. Such a standard of care is neither feasible nor practicable, especially when alternatives like having a call bell already provided a certain level of safeguard.</a></p><a id="p1_85"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">(vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the Defendant’s staff responded to the Plaintiff’s call for help after the Fall in a timely manner</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a><a id="p1_86">86&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the allegation that the Defendant was not responsive in attending to Plaintiff after she fell, the records showed that the call bell was pressed at 0853 hours.

These decisions on breach of duty have limited precedential value.</em> …..</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, treating standard of care as a factual inquiry does not preclude the courts from relying on past decisions in similar fact situations as to what constitutes reasonable conduct in the instant case….</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <em>Consistent with the concept of standard of care as largely a fact-driven exercise</em>, the court in Zheng Yu Shan v Lian Beng Construction (1988) Pte Ltd, in assessing the standard of care of employers, has opined that the <em>case precedents, in order to be useful, should involve “facts that are very similar or analogous to the facts of the particular case before the court.” [emphasis added]</em></p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a><a id="p1_93">93&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both authorities cited by Plaintiff’s Counsel involved cases where bed railings were not put in place. Bed railings are meant to prevent a patient from falling off a bed. The Plaintiff had not explained how having the bed rails up would have made any difference in the present case.</a></p><a id="p1_93"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a><a id="p1_94">94&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various other distinguishing factors between the two cited cases and the present case have also been noted in paragraph [91] above. Unlike the cited cases, in the present case, it could not be said that the fact that the Plaintiff would self-ambulate from the Visitor’s Chair to the bed was clearly foreseeable to the Defendant based on the Plaintiff’s past conduct. To the contrary, Plaintiff’s past behaviour suggested that she was an active user of the call bell and would more likely than not have sought assistance with moving back to the bed instead of attempting such transfer unassisted. Given that the cited cases contemplate different factual scenarios from the present case, and given the <em>factual</em> nature of the inquiry as to whether the Defendant had breached its duty of care, I was of the view that the cases cited by the Plaintiff had very little precedential value and were of limited assistance in the present case.</a></p><a id="p1_94"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion on whether Defendant fell below the standard of care required</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a><a id="p1_95">95&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the present case involved an unwitnessed fall, which pitted the Plaintiff’s words against the Defendant’s words. The burden of proof was on the Plaintiff to show that Defendant had fallen below the requisite standard of care. The Plaintiff, however, presented herself to be a less than credible witness at trial. I had explained why I had serious doubts about the Plaintiff’s credibility, especially given the rehearsed nature of her testimonies, and her tendency to label positions put to her as lies even when they were backed by objective evidence.</a></p><a id="p1_95"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a><a id="p1_96">96&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things considered, I found that the Plaintiff had not discharged her burden of proving, on a balance of probabilities, that the hospital had fallen short of the standard of care required of it. In particular, I did not find it plausible that Ms Myat had placed her on the Visitor’s Chair. I also did not think SN Hou was negligent in not voluntarily transferring the Plaintiff from the Visitor’s Chair back to the bed when she did her medication rounds, especially as she had ensured that the call bell was left within the Plaintiff’s reach and Plaintiff did not complain of any discomfort while seated in the Visitor’s Chair. In this regard, I did not accept the Plaintiff’s bare assertion that the nurses failed to ensure that the call bell was within her reach – this was one of the most basic things that a nurse would look out for, especially for a patient with a fall risk, in an isolation room. Indeed, Ms Myat and SN Hou were consistent in their testimonies that they had done so. The Plaintiff’s testimony that the call bell was placed out of her reach was unproven, and based on her bare assertion only. I found on a balance of probabilities that the call bell was placed within the Plaintiff’s reach and she was reminded to use the call bell to ask for assistance. These measures required the Plaintiff’s co-operation and compliance. Prior to 10 April 2017, Plaintiff had been a cooperative patient who understood and complied with such instructions. She had on no less than 297 occasions activated the call bell to seek assistance. It was not reasonable to expect JCH’s staff to predict or assume that she would suddenly decide not to follow the nurses’ instructions.</a></p><a id="p1_96"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a><a id="p1_97">97&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, I found that JCH provided a safe environment for the Plaintiff with appropriate fall prevention measures in place. Ultimately, the Plaintiff’s fall was caused by her own actions, when she attempted to self-ambulate to her bed from the Visitor’s chair. Her actions were beyond the control of JCH and its staff. JCH could not be faulted for a lack of cooperation on the part of Plaintiff in availing of the precautionary measures (<em>e.g.</em> by activating the call bell for transfer assistance) that were put in place for the patient’s safety, which ended in injury being sustained by the patient.</a></p><a id="p1_97"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Judgment</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a><a id="p1_98">98&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, I found that the Plaintiff had not established her case in negligence or contract against the hospital.
