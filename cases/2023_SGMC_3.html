It follows from almost one and the half years of counselling sessions, which began in 2020 after the Claimant had threatened legal action for the emotional trauma that he allegedly suffered upon finding out that the Defendant only regarded him as a friend.</a></p><a id="p1_1"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Defendant had hoped that the counselling sessions would help the Claimant come to terms with her decision to not pursue a romantic relationship with him, this was not the result. Faced with repeated requests and demands for more frequent meetings and deeper conversations, the Defendant decided in May 2022 to cease all contact with the Claimant. An Expedited Protection Order has since been obtained against him, but the Defendant remains faced with the task of defending lawsuits brought by the Claimant.</a></p><a id="p1_2"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to bringing this action, he had initiated a claim against her in the General Division of the High Court (“High Court”) for damages in excess of $3 million. This $3 million, he claims, would serve as damages for among others, indefinite loss of potential investments, rehabilitation and therapy programs to overcome the sustained trauma, as well as reductions in his earning capacity.</a></p><a id="p1_3"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Defendant proved her resolve to defend the High Court action, he commenced this action in the Magistrate’s Court, seeking $22,000 in special damages for “lost income arising from [his] affected earning capacity” stemming from the Defendant’s breach of an agreement, which he says arose from an “offer” that she had made on 24 April 2022.</a></p><a id="p1_4"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Striking out application</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Applicable principles</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this application, the Defendant seeks to strike out his claim for disclosing no reasonable cause of action, being an abuse of process, or pursuant to the inherent powers of the Court.

If that is found to be the case, then the action will not be struck out.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order 9 r 16(1)(<em>b</em>) allows the court to strike out pleadings which constitute an abuse of process of the court. The inquiry here includes considerations of public policy and the interests of justice, and signifies that the process of the court must be used <em>bona fide</em> and properly and must not be abused; the court will prevent improper use of its machinery and the judicial process from being used as a means of vexation and oppression in the process of litigation: <em>Gabriel Peter</em> at [22].</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Order 9 r 16(1)(<em>c</em>) allows the Court to strike out pleadings when it is in the interests of justice to do so. … [T]his gives effect to the court’s inherent jurisdiction to prevent injustice, such as where the claim is plainly or obviously unsustainable: <em>The “Bunga Melati 5”</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 4 SLR 0546.xml')">[2012] 4 SLR 546</a> at [33].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, it is accepted that authorities pertaining to O 18 r 19(1) of the Rules of Court 2014, the predecessor provision of O 9 r 16(1) of ROC 2021, remain relevant in assessing the merits of a striking out application: see <em>Leong Quee Ching Karen v Lim Soon Huat and others</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29078-SSP.xml')">[2022] SGHC 309</a> at [23] and <em>Eurogreen Building Products Private Limited v Savourer Pte Ltd</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27917-SSP.xml')">[2022] SGMC 53</a> at [13].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these overarching principles, I proceed to consider the application.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">No reasonable cause of action</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first ground relied on by the Defendant is that the Statement of Claim (“SOC”) discloses no reasonable cause of action against her. Reference is made to the chain of messages between the parties as exhibited in her affidavit in support of this application. It is submitted that such messages were exchanged in a social context, and when read holistically, reveal that there was no intention to create legal relations. Accordingly, an essential requirement for contractual formation is not satisfied, and so the claim in breach of contract is unsustainable and must fail.</a></p><a id="p1_9"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the Claimant rightly submitted, O 9 r 16(2) of ROC 2021 provides that “[n]o evidence is admissible on an application under [O 9 r&nbsp;16](1)(<em>a</em>) of ROC 2021]”. Without reference to any evidence, and in particular to the chain of messages in the Defendant’s affidavit, I am unable to conclude that the Claimant’s claim, premised on a breach of contract, is wholly devoid of merit or that it is “plain and obvious” that the claim discloses no reasonable cause of action (<em>Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1997] 3 SLR(R) 0649.xml')">[1997] 3 SLR(R) 649</a> (“<em>Gabriel Peter</em>”) at [18]). This is because the Claimant has pleaded all the requirements necessary for a binding agreement, namely an offer, acceptance, intention to create legal relations, and consideration. He has also pleaded the alleged breach of such agreement, namely her act of “wantonly ceas[ing]” contact with him to “evade” her obligations under the agreement.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Abuse of process</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn therefore to consider the alternate ground of whether the claim is an abuse of process of the Court. The abuse of process ground found in O 9 r&nbsp;16(1)(<em>b</em>) of ROC 2021 seeks to ensure that the court’s process is used only for proper and <em>bona fide</em> purposes (<em>Chia Kok Kee v Tan Wah and others</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 2 SLR 0352.xml')">[2012] 2 SLR 352</a> (“<em>Chia Kok Wee</em>”) at [29]). This allows the court to “prevent the improper use of its machinery” and prevents “the judicial process from being used as a means of vexation and oppression in the process of litigation” (<em>Gabriel Peter</em> at [22]). Before exercising such power, the court must look at all the circumstances of the case (<em>Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 1 SLR(R) 0453.xml')">[2007] 1 SLR(R) 453</a> at [53]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A common instance of the courts exercising their discretion to strike out a pleading to stem an abuse of process is when there is a re-litigation of former claims that have already been adjudicated upon (see, <em>eg, Chia Kok Wee</em>). However, the categories of conduct rendering a claim an abuse of process are not closed and will depend on the relevant circumstances of each case, and another judicially recognised type of conduct that constitutes an abuse of process is the bringing of an action for a collateral purpose (<em>Gabriel Peter</em> at [22]). The abuse of process doctrine was described by Sir Jack Jacob in “The Inherent Jurisdiction of the Court” (1970) 23 CLP 23 at 40–41 (cited with approval in <em>Chee Siok Chin and others v Minister for Home Affairs and another</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/9595-SSP-M.xml')">[2006] 1 SLR(R) 582</a> (“<em>Chee Siok Chin</em>”) at [32]):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>It connotes that the process of the court must be used properly, honestly and in good faith, and must not be abused. It means that the court will not allow its function as a court of law to be misused, and it will summarily prevent its machinery from being used as a means of vexation or oppression in the process of litigation</b>. Unless the court had power to intervene summarily to prevent the misuse of legal machinery, the nature and function of the court would be transformed from a court dispensing justice into an instrument of injustice. It follows that where an abuse of process has taken place, the intervention of the court by stay or even dismissal of proceedings may often be required by the very essence of justice to be done, and so to prevent parties being harassed and put to expense by frivolous, vexatious or groundless litigation. [emphasis in original removed, emphasis added in bold]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abuse of process can thus be classified into four categories, namely (<em>Chee Siok Chin</em> at [34]):</a></p><a id="p1_13"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proceedings which involve a deception on the court, or are fictitious or constitute a mere sham;</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proceedings where the <em>process of the court is not being fairly or honestly used but is employed for some ulterior or improper purpose or in an improper way</em>;</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proceedings which are <em>manifestly groundless or without foundation</em> or which serve no useful purpose;</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multiple or successive proceedings which cause or are likely to cause improper vexation or oppression.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, the Defendant submits that this claim amounts to an abuse of process as it is without foundation and has been brought for an ulterior purpose, namely to ensure that she will comply with his demands to, among other things, resume communications with him.

There is also hurt from the fact that you are main victim in harassment incidents and <b>im associated victim because of that</b>. It’s not your fault but that’s just how the situation is. So to omit emotional support is harsh because in the first place <b>there’s lots of duty of care owed</b>. You know me…I don’t anyhow attribute my damage if it doesn’t have a strong legal basis.

Even if one can regard the Defendant’s sending of the List of Improvements as an “offer”, there was no communication of acceptance of such offer on the Claimant’s part (see <em>R1 International Pte Ltd v Lonstroff AG</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16856-SSP.xml')">[2015] 1 SLR 521</a> at [53]). Contrarily, he consistently sought to add to the List of Improvements, and such proposed additions were all rejected by her (see [26] above). Also, when she sought to suggest that there had been an agreement between parties, he quickly rejected this, and reiterated that he had needs which had not been reflected in her list, most significantly the desire to become more involved in her life.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> On 8 May 2022, the Claimant insisted that any perceived “agreement” bearing the terms of the List of Improvements proposed by the Defendant was “void”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> Seen thus, parties were <em>at best</em> exchanging offers and counteroffers without any acceptance ever being communicated.

This presumption is not displaced, and is in fact entrenched when reviewed against the evidence, which demonstrates that the List of Improvements had been sent amidst discussions about the steps that could be taken to improve their relationship. The commitments made by the Defendant included “[n]ot trivialising [the Claimant’s] pain and hurt”, providing “weekly sharing[s] of her work and volunteer”, and to meet up based on their mutual availability, beyond coffee settings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> Such commitments, which are legally difficult to enforce, and which were communicated on an instant messaging platform without the benefit of legal advice, can scarcely be said to be made with an intention to create legal relations.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is especially so when one considers the relevant background in which the List of Improvements was sent. As mentioned, the parties had begun counselling sessions after the Claimant had threatened legal proceedings against the Defendant due to their misaligned views about their relationship. In this light, the List of Improvements was meant to set out the concessions or commitments that the Defendant was willing to make to better align their relationship. This list was then to be sent to Ms Irene, but it appears that the Defendant never sent that list to Ms Irene because parties could not come to an agreement on the proper scope of the list.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a> The List of Improvements was therefore <em>drafted for the purpose of their counselling session</em>,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> and was to be a step towards better regulating their interpersonal relations. There is nothing to suggest that when such commitments were made, the Defendant intended that they would be legally binding against her.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Claimant’s bare denial of the above is plainly insufficient to displace the presumption that there was <em>no</em> intention to create legal relations. In sum, he is seeking by this action to unilaterally impose a contract along the terms of the List of Improvements. However, the lack of an intention to create legal relations and lack of an unequivocal acceptance of any offer are fatal to his claim.</a></p><a id="p1_38"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Ulterior purpose</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of evidence just detailed also collectively reveal the Claimant’s proclivity to raise threats or suggestions of litigation to compel compliance from the Defendant (see [16]–[18], [22], and [30]–[31] above). The compliance which he seeks from her is essentially to maintain communications and interactions at a level satisfactory to him. Any perceived shortfall on her part has repeatedly become a source of conflict, first in 2020, and subsequently as revealed in their messages in 2022. Counselling sessions and the Defendant’s constant attempts to reason with him have borne little fruit, with the Claimant insisting on his “needs” and that compromises have already been made on his part. In my judgment, he is not, by the present action, seeking monetary relief. Rather, as the Defendant has surmised, he is primarily utilising the action as a tool to punish her for refusing to comply with his demands to, among other things, resume their interactions and communications.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of his Offer to Settle, sent after the Defendant had left him in the cold, is most telling of this underlying motive to re-engage with her at all costs. That offer preceded his initiation of the High Court proceedings, wherein he has sought in excess of $3 million in damages. This is by no means a small sum, and yet the Offer to Settle, sent in a bid to avoid the commencement of the High Court action, merely stipulates for them to work together to repair the “sizeable harm” that had been caused by her “recent conduct”, presumably of setting up barriers and ignoring him entirely (see [31] above). There is <em>no</em> mention therein of any monetary compensation payable by her, strongly suggesting that his true motivation for threatening and bringing legal proceedings against her is <em>not</em> to seek payment for “damages”, but to tear down her barriers and to compel her into submission. As he had warned in 2020, she could either accede to his demands or suffer “irrevocable damages [<em>sic</em>] to [her] personal and professional endeavours”.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, I give heed to the following sequence of events that happened in August 2022, one month after the High Court action was initiated. First, on 3 August 2022, the Defendant obtained an Expedited Protection Order against the Claimant, prohibiting him from using any threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour that would cause her harassment, alarm, or distress.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a> A week later, on 10 August 2022, the Defendant showed that she would not bend to his demands by engaging lawyers and filing her Defence and Counterclaim in the High Court action. On 26 August 2022, the Claimant filed his Defence to Counterclaim, and the very next day, on 27 August 2022, he initiated the present action in the Magistrate’s Court, allegedly claiming for the breach of the List of Improvements.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the proximity in time of the above events add further weight to the Defendant’s suspicion that the present action has been initiated as another attempt to break her will after the High Court action had failed to do so. This is especially so as the claims raised in both actions are so closely related that any party exercising reasonable diligence could properly have raised and argued the points there (<em>Goldbell Engineering Pte Ltd v Etiqa Insurance Pte Ltd (Range Construction Pte Ltd, third party) and another matter</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27017-SSP.xml')">[2022] SGHC 1</a> at [90(c)]):</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the High Court action, the Claimant avers that due to certain defamatory remarks (<em>eg</em>, “<em>I am feeling very harassed by his actions</em>”) and negligence on the Defendant’s part, he has suffered, among others, a loss in earning capacity and business partnerships amounting to $510,000, as well as $120,000 in general damages “[f]or costs incurred and to be incurred in rehabilitation and therapy programs to wholly overcome sustained trauma”.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this action, he claims that because of the Defendant’s breach of the List of Improvements, his earning capacity as an “active high&nbsp;-&nbsp;capital trader by night and a busy CEO by day” has been negatively affected. In addition, he has had to “expend time and energies to scramble and source for deeper psychological assistance”. For such harm, he claims $22,000 in “special damages”.</a></p><a id="p1_42-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_43">43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some latitude would ordinarily have been granted to the Claimant, who is unrepresented, for improperly commencing multiple closely related claims before different forums. However, the present circumstances do not merit such latitude because the initiation of this action after the High Court action was clearly <em>not</em> a result of the lack of reasonable diligence. Instead, it is entirely consistent with his threat of exhausting her resources through legal action so as to pressure her to comply.</a></p><a id="p1_43"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a><a id="p1_44">44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowing the Defendant’s words, the Claimant has commenced this action “simply because [she] no longer want[s] to have contact with him in any way and he is refusing to accept this fact.”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a> This is well supported by his course of conduct and correspondence with her over the years, which I have detailed above. The body of evidence collectively reveal his tendency to resort to legalese and raise threats of litigation to compel compliance from the Defendant.
