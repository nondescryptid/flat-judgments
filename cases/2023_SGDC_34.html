The action was brought after the Plaintiff discovered that false and negative reviews posted against the Plaintiff’s business on social media platforms were allegedly made by someone who was an employee of the Defendant. The Defendant denied involvement in the said reviews.</a></p><a id="p1_1"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this action, the Defendant also counterclaimed for defamation against the Plaintiff. The allegedly defamatory statements were found in a letter of demand issued to the Defendant. The Plaintiff’s founder and director posted the first page of the letter of demand on his Facebook account. The contents of the letter of demand were subsequently reported in online news articles.</a></p><a id="p1_2"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action came for trial before me.

It operated a food stall under the name “The Social Outcast” at The Bedok Marketplace, a food centre that houses various eateries. The Social Outcast has been serving “woodfire smoked and charcoal grilled meat” since 2019.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a> According to the Plaintiff, it is a “Muslim-owned” establishment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant is also a company that provides food and beverage services. Like the Plaintiff, it also operated a food stall at The Bedok Marketplace, under the name “Ishiro SG”. Ishiro SG (“Ishiro”) serves Japanese fusion rice bowls.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Social Outcast moved into The Bedok Marketplace in or around June 2020.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a> Ishiro opened its outlet at The Bedok Marketplace in or around November 2020.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The two stalls were located about 15 feet apart.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff’s claim arose from a spate of negative reviews and comments posted by the Defendant’s former employee, Mr Chua Wen Bin (“Mr Chua”), in relation to The Social Outcast on Facebook. It is undisputed that he posted the negative reviews on 4 December 2020, when he was still an employee of the Defendant.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I discuss the negative reviews, I should first explain what incited the negative reviews. According to Mr Chua, he became upset with the Plaintiff when the Plaintiff’s Mr Aminurrashid Bin Hasnordin (“Mr Aminurrashid”), failed to collect an order placed with Ishiro. After placing the order, Mr Chua apparently told him they were not halal, but Mr Aminurrashid replied, “who cares” and went to the toilet. Mr Chua prepared the order but it was neither paid for nor collected.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a> This incident happened shortly after Ishiro opened shop at The Bedok Marketplace. Mr Aminurrashid is a director and shareholder of the Plaintiff. At that time, Mr Chua was appointed as an outlet manager of the Ishiro stall at The Bedok Marketplace.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Mr Chua, this incident, along with him not being satisfied with the food and service provided by The Social Outcast, led Mr Chua to post negative reviews about their food and services on Facebook.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chua posted the negative reviews (along with other disparaging comments) against The Social Outcast on 4 December 2020 on two separate Facebook pages.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, he did so by posting comments on a video featuring the business of The Social Outcast on the Facebook page of “Oddle Eats”, a food delivery business. The comments were posted using his personal Facebook account, which was named “C New Nib” or “C Bea Leave”, amongst others, at different points in time. The comments read as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_11"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <em>“Yea extra charge for a supposedly free sauce. And the lady boss is disgusting her fake smile is just ew.

Apart from these two sets of statements, the Plaintiff alleged that a separate statement made on the Google review page of “The Social Outcast” was also authored and posted by Mr Chua. This statement was posted on 11 September 2021 under a Google account named “Wen Kai”. Mr Chua however denied posting this statement. The said statement reads:</a></p><a id="p1_13"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <em>“Patty is overcooked and not juicy. Overpriced.

The first order was made on 17 January 2021, amounting to $88. The Plaintiff prepared the order, only to discover that the delivery address was the Plaintiff’s own stall when it was handing over the food to the deliveryman. The order was not pre-paid by credit card but indicated as “cash on delivery”. In the notes of the Grabfood order, Mr Chua used the term “Yala M”. The second order was made on 23 January 2021. The Plaintiff contacted Grabfood to cancel the order upon realising it was placed using the same mobile number that was used to place the first order.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the prank orders were made, no notable incident took place between February 2021 to August 2021, save that the Plaintiff temporarily ceased operations from 30 May 2021 to 13 September 2021 to shift its operations to the Grandstand, 200 Turf Club Road, #01-35A, Singapore 287994.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chua came under the spotlight again in September 2021, when another food and beverage business Mentai-Ya Pte Ltd, trading under the name “Mentai-Ya”, posted a video on their Facebook page on 7 September 2021 publishing their investigation findings on negative reviews and comments made against Mentai-Ya (the “Mentai-Ya video”).

It would have made more sense for Mr Chua to post Google review(s) against the Plaintiff’s business at around the same time he posted the negative reviews and comments on Facebook in December 2020. The Plaintiff did not plead and lead evidence showing that Mr Chua had posted negative Google reviews against its business at around that time.

The First Oddle Eats Statement informs the reader that they are likely to experience poor service attitude when they patronise the Plaintiff’s business. The Fourth Oddle Eats Statement informs the reader that the food served at the Plaintiff’s business is unappetising and expensive.</a></p><a id="p1_58"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a><a id="p1_59">59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same, however, cannot be said about the Second and Third Oddle Statements.</a></p><a id="p1_59"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59"></a><a id="p1_59-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Second Oddle Eats Statement is undoubtedly unsavoury and unpleasant, the statement relates more to Mr Aminurrashid in his personal capacity as opposed to the Plaintiff’s business. I do not think that a reasonable reader would think less of the Plaintiff’s business just because its owner is allegedly not financially well off. The Plaintiff did not establish how Mr Aminurrashid’s personal financial circumstances would have a direct bearing on the competency of the Plaintiff’s business, in aspects such as its food quality, dining experience and service quality. Logically speaking, a financially constrained person can still strive to serve delicious food paired with excellent service. I should also add that it is not immediately apparent to me what the word “yalam” means. The Plaintiff submits that this is a derogatory term for Malays and was intended to “incite racial friction”. But even assuming it is a derogatory term for Malays as a whole which is intended to incite racial friction, that in and of itself does not connote that the Plaintiff’s business is incompetent.</a></p><a id="p1_59-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_59-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Third Oddle Eats Statement does not speak to the competency of the Plaintiff’s business.

No credible evidence was however led to establish these defences. Aside from a bare assertion that the remarks were based on his personal experience, Mr Chua led no evidence to establish that the Defamatory Statements were made based on facts that were true or substantially true (<em>Review Publishing</em> at [134] and [141]). The Defendant or Mr Chua could have adduced evidence of the Plaintiff’s menu to prove whether the average dining cost per person was indeed $25 as alleged in the Fourth Oddle Eats Statement. Mr Chua could also have adduced evidence of what sauce was he referring to when he said the Plaintiff charges for a sauce that was supposed to be free in the First Oddle Eats Statement. Further, he gave no specifics in his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”) on how and in what way did Mr Aminurrashid “complain a lot” when he patronised the Plaintiff’s business, as alleged in the First Oddle Eats Statement.</a></p><a id="p1_64"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a><a id="p1_65">65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, Mr Chua admitted on the stand that he was spurred to make the Defamatory Statements by an incident between himself and Mr Aminurrashid sometime in November 2020. According to him, Mr Aminurrashid placed an order with Ishiro through Mr Chua but did not collect it. This caused Mr Chua to be upset with Mr Aminurrashid. In my view, the Defamatory Statements were likely motivated by spite. This is consistent with his established record of posting false or exaggerated negative reviews against various businesses with which he has had unpleasant dealings. In this regard, Mr Chua testified that he was the one who posted the multiple one-star reviews and negative comments against the various businesses identified in the Mentai-Ya video.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a> One review, according to him, was not enough because he wanted to bring down star rating of those businesses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> For example, he admitted to posting multiple false, one-star reviews against “Jin Ji Teochew Braised Duck &amp; Kwap Chap” because of some conflict he has had with the owner of that business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> Against another business called “T7 Auto Car Pte Ltd, which according to Mr Chua was a car repair workshop, Mr Chua was unable to justify why he posted that they “keep hard selling useless things”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Defendant should be liable for the Defamatory Statements</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Primary liability</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66">66&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the fact that Mr Chua had published defamatory statements is not the end of the matter.

In the present case, I am not satisfied that the Defendant would suffer no prejudice. The Statement of Claim gave the Defendant the impression that the sole factual basis for imposing liability on the Defendant was the fact that the Mr Chua was the Defendant’s employee. It made no mention that the Defendant had an active hand in the publication of the Defamatory Statements. In fact, the Defendant took exception to this in its Defence, even though it was not required to raise legal arguments in its Defence.

The Plaintiff led no credible evidence to prove that the Defendant had participated in, secured and/or authorised the publication of the Defamatory Statements.

While the English Court of Appeal took the view that publication could be made out by the secretary’s failure to remove the statement, that was because she had “complete control” over the notice board (at 827, <em>per</em> Greer LJ). Dominion over the walls was key to finding that she associated herself with the continued publication (at 835, <em>per</em> Slesser LJ). The secretary was “entitled to take it down” and by knowingly allowing it to remain on the wall, it was held that she was “a consenting party to the defamatory statement” (at 829, <em>per</em> Greer LJ). Having the “power” to remove it and failing to exercise that power could constitute publication (at 838, <em>per</em> Greene LJ).</a></p><a id="p1_74-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_74-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, it could not be said that Mr Goh had any control over Mr Chua’s personal Facebook account. Indeed, the Plaintiff’s case did not even go so far. Mr Chua’s Facebook account was his to use and there is no evidence that it was used in the course of his employment. In fact, there was no evidence that the Defamatory Statements were published during work. Since Mr Goh had no power to remove the Defamatory Statements, it could not be said that he had consented to their publication by allowing them to remain published.</a></p><a id="p1_74-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_75">75&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff’s submission is tantamount to saying food and beverage companies should be liable for negative reviews posted by their employees on other businesses, if they do not procure their employees to remove them. Yet the Plaintiff adduced no authority to establish that employers have a legal duty to <em>actively police</em> what employees post about other businesses in their personal capacity. To my mind, this seems like an onerous duty which will likely entail employers undertaking significant time and expenses to actively monitor, evaluate and investigate content generated on their employees’ social media accounts and consult employees on the same. That being said, it is not necessary for me to decide on whether such duty should be imposed in this case since the existence of such duty was not even pleaded by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff’s pleaded case made no mention that the Defendant bore a duty to monitor Mr Chua’s Facebook activity and request Mr Chua to remove the Oddle Eats Statements.</a></p><a id="p1_75"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a><a id="p1_76">76&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the Plaintiff’s case against the Defendant is speculative. It hauled the Defendant to court merely on a suspicion that the Defendant could have instructed Mr Chua to post the Defamatory Statements. As Mr Aminurrashid testified during trial, he was of the view that the Defendant “might” have instructed someone within the company to post the Defamatory Statements.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a> When pressed as to who gave that instruction, Mr Aminurrashid was unable to give a straight answer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span> He could only point to Mr Chua’s appointment as a manager and that he is allegedly “closely linked with the director”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> The mere fact that Mr Chua was a manager of an Ishiro outlet and that he was on friendly terms with Mr Goh clearly does not pass muster. To establish primary liability against Mr Chua’s employer, the Plaintiff ought to show that the Defendant had a hand in the publication of the Defamatory Statements. The evidence however shows that Mr Chua published the Defamatory Statements in his personal capacity and on his own accord.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77">77&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the Plaintiff failed to establish that the Defendant had participated in the publication of the Oddle Eats Statements.</a></p><a id="p1_77"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a><a id="p1_78">78&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Plaintiff’s Facebook Page Statement, there is no evidence that Mr Goh was even aware of those statements at the time they were published or even shortly after.

The Plaintiff pleaded primary liability in its Statement of Claim, alleging that the Defendant was responsible for the statements made by Mr Chua. The failure to plead factual matters that could be used to attribute secondary liability to the Defendant was in fact highlighted in the Defence. Despite being alerted of this issue, the Plaintiff made no attempt to amend its pleadings to plead vicarious liability. This would have entailed the identification of factual circumstances that would justify the imposition of secondary liability on the Defendant. In this regard, it is trite that the inquiry depends on whether the tortfeasor’s conduct had a <em>sufficient connection</em> with the relationship between the tortfeasor and the defendant. Not only must there be a special relationship between the tortfeasor and the defendant, the defendant must in some way have <em>created or significantly enhanced, by virtue of that relationship, the very risk that in fact materialised</em>, in order to be held vicariously liable for the tortfeasor’s wrongful acts (<em>Ng Huat Seng and another v Munib Mohammad Madni and another</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21099-SSP.xml')">[2017] 2 SLR 1074</a> at [62]-[66]). It is not clear from the Plaintiff’s pleadings whether the Defendant did anything to enhance the risk of Mr Chua making the Defamatory Statements.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81">81&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No evidence was also led on what the Defendant did to enhance the risk of Mr Chua making the Defamatory Statements. It is also not clear from the Plaintiff’s submissions what connection there was between Mr Chua’s role and the publication of the Defamatory Statements. The fact of the matter is that the Defamatory Statements were made by Mr Chua using his personal Facebook account. It is undisputed that posting negative reviews about other food establishments did not form part of Mr Chua’s job scope or authority. Mr Chua’s role was to manage the Ishiro stall. That role did not entail posting reviews or comments on other businesses in the vicinity.</a></p><a id="p1_81"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a><a id="p1_82">82&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff cited <em>Dubai Aluminium Company Limited v Salaam and others</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/English/70571-E-M.xml')">[2003] 2 AC 366</a> at [32], where Lord Nicholls of the House of Lords drew a distinction between employees acting in furtherance of the employer’s business as opposed to pursuing their own interest:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;… A distinction is to be drawn between cases such as <em>Hamlyn v John Houston &amp; Co</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/English/45659-E-M.xml')">[1903] 1 KB 81</a>, where the employee was engaged, however misguidedly, in furthering his employer's business, and cases where the employee is engaged solely in pursuing his own interests: on a 'frolic of his own', in the language of the time-honoured catch phrase. In the former type of case the employee, while seeking to promote his employer's interests, does an act of a kind he is authorised to do. Then it may well be appropriate to attribute responsibility for his act to the employer, even though the manner of performance was not authorised or, indeed, was prohibited. The matter stands differently when the employee is engaged only in furthering his own interests, as distinct from those of his employer. Then he acts 'so as to be in effect a stranger in relation to his employer with respect to the act he has committed': see Isaacs J in <em>Bugge v Brown</em> (1919) 26 CLR 110, 118. Then the mere fact that the act was of a kind the employee was authorised to do will not, of itself, fasten liability on the employer. In the absence of 'holding out' and reliance, there is no reason in principle why it should. …</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83">83&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not persuaded that Mr Chua was acting in furtherance of the Defendant’s interest when he made the Defamatory Statements. As I have explained at [65] above, they were likely motivated by spite. Mr Chua has an established record of posting negative reviews against various businesses with which he has had unpleasant dealings (see [65] above). This included various businesses outside of the food and beverage industry and eateries that were not even located in The Bedok Marketplace.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a> Amongst such eateries, various businesses were not serving the same genre of food as Ishiro.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span> For instance, it is undisputed that the affected businesses, “Mad Charcoal” and “Nagara Thai Gold” served western grilled food and Thai cuisine respectively.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span> In my view, the Defamatory Statements were unlikely to be made with the intention of boosting Ishiro’s popularity in The Bedok Marketplace.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84">84&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the Plaintiff adduced no evidence to show that the Defamatory Statements would further the Defendant’s business objectives. On the contrary, the undisputed evidence is that the Plaintiff and the Defendant served different genres of food. One served Halal-certified grilled food while the other served Japanese cuisine. While they were located in the same food centre, so were many other stalls.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a> It is not clear to me how undermining the Plaintiff’s reputation would confer a substantial benefit to the Defendant. If anything, it would probably be the other stalls serving cuisines similar to the Plaintiff’s that would stand to directly benefit from the negative reviews. I am fortified in my view by the fact that the Plaintiff’s representative, Mr Aminurrashid, in his contemporaneous messages to Mr Chua, expressed that the Plaintiff was not a direct competitor of the Defendant as they served different genres of food.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85">85&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff also cited <em>Bellman v Northampton Recruitment Ltd</em> [2018] EWCA Civ 2214 (“<em>Bellman</em>”), where the English Court of Appeal imposed vicarious liability on the employer for the employee’s wrongful conduct even though it occurred outside the workplace and outside office hours.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a> The wrongful conduct involved the employee, the managing director of the employer, assaulting an employee after a Christmas party organised for the employees. The assault took place when the inebriated managing director became annoyed at questions raised about an employee’s appointment (at [6]). The court found that the managing director had “a wide remit” and was “in overall charge of all aspects” of the business. In holding the employer vicariously liable, the court found that there is sufficient connection between the position in which the managing director was employed and his wrongful act (at [23]-[25]). He was giving a lecture to his subordinates in exercise of his authority.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86">86&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Bellman</em>, in my view, is distinguishable on the present facts because Mr Chua did not make the Defamatory Statements in exercise of his authority as a manager of the stall. The Defamatory Statements were published in his capacity as a purported customer of the Plaintiff’s business.</a></p><a id="p1_86"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a><a id="p1_87">87&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Mohamud v Wm Morrison Supermarkets plc</em> [2016] AC 677 (“<em>Mohamud</em>”) is another case relied upon by the Plaintiff to establish vicarious liability.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a> In that case, the claimant visited the defendant’s petrol station and asked the defendant’s employee whether it is possible to print some documents from his USB stick. The employee refused the request in an offensive manner and ordered him to leave. He then followed the claimant as he walked back to his car, told him to never return, and physically assaulted him. The UK Supreme Court found that the employee’s job was to attend to customer and respond to their inquiries. On the facts, there was an “unbroken sequence of events” between his response to the claimant’s initial inquiry and his physical assault. The court also found that this was “not something personal between them; it was an order to keep away from his employer’s premises, which he reinforced by violence”. In giving such an order, he was purporting to act about his employer’s business. This led the court to find that there was sufficient connection between the employee’s job and his wrongful conduct, which made the employer vicariously liable (at [47]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88">88&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Mohamud</em> is, in my view, also distinguishable. In the present case, Mr Chua’s publication of the Defamatory Statements stemmed from a personal dislike that he took against Mr Aminurrashid. He decided to publish the Defamatory Statements against his business out of spite, much in the same way as he published negative reviews against other businesses such as “Jin Ji Teochew Braised Duck &amp; Kway Chap” (see [65] above). When posting these reviews, he was not purporting to act for the Defendant’s business. He did so in his personal capacity and to vent his inner frustration.</a></p><a id="p1_88"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Admission of liability</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a><a id="p1_89">89&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff also claimed that the Defendant had “accepted responsibility and liability as the employer” of Mr Chua for the Defamatory Statements, by way of three statements published on its Instagram and Facebook pages on 8 and 9 September 2021.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a> I do not think it is necessary to delve into the first and third statements as the Plaintiff did not seek to rely on these as admissions in its Statement of Claim.

A mere admission against a party’s interest (i.e. a statement which suggests an inference detrimental to his case) is not necessarily also an admission of liability (<em>The Enterprise Fund II Ltd v Jong Hee Sen</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20050-SSP.xml')">[2017] 3 SLR 487</a> at [19]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92">92&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the Defendant’s Second Public Statement did not give rise to a clear and unequivocal admission of liability in relation to the Plaintiff.

The statement clarified that the reviews were “unfortunately posted by [Mr Chua] on his own accord”. The statement then went on to say the Defendant would “take full responsibility of the actions of our employee” and “assumes full responsibility for [the Defendant’s] actions”. This sentence raises more questions than provide answers. If the Defendant was not involved in the posting of the negative reviews, why was it assuming “full responsibility” of Mr Chua’s actions? And what form of responsibility was it assuming? Was it legal responsibility in the form of damages or was it in the form of an apology and to take disciplinary actions against Mr Chua? It is not readily apparent that the Defendant was agreeable to pay <em>damages</em> for the Defamatory Statements.</a></p><a id="p1_93"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a><a id="p1_94">94&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is compounded by the fact that the Plaintiff was not even identified in the statement. The statement is addressed to “Mentai-Ya and all businesses than have been affected”. Mr Goh testified that the statement was published in the aftermath of the Mentai-Ya video. It is undisputed that the Plaintiff was not identified as one of the affected businesses in the Mentai-Ya video. In fact, it was the Plaintiff’s own pleaded case that the apology was “not directed at the Plaintiff”.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a> It is trite that parties are bounded by their pleadings and cannot advance an inconsistent position without amending its pleadings. The Plaintiff’s belated submission that “all businesses that have been affected” contains an implicit reference to the Plaintiff runs contrary to its pleaded case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95">95&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the statement purports to offer an apology to “Mentai-Ya and all business that have been affected” by Mr Chua’s negative reviews, that in and of itself is neither here nor there. Mr Goh explained on the stand the Defendant chose to take a more humble and apologetic approach in its second statement to appease its customers and the public, as it received many negative comments and dislikes for its first statement.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a> Further, the apology must be read in the context of the Defendant clarifying in the same statement that it was not involved in the publication of those statements. I am not persuaded that the apology in this context should be construed as an admission of liability. No authorities to that effect were cited by the Plaintiff.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96">96&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, as far as the Plaintiff is concerned, any doubt as to whether the Defendant’s Second Public Statement gave rise to an admission would have been dispelled by the time it received the Defendant’s response to its letter of demand. In its letter of demand dated 15 September 2021, the Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant “expressly admitted” that the Defendant “took full responsibility” for the actions of its employee. The Defendant’s solicitor issued a letter dated 23 September 2021 objecting to the assertion that the statements amounted to any form of admission. The letter clarified that the Defendant had merely assumed responsibilities to its stakeholders by making public its findings after internal investigations were completed and to assure its stakeholders that appropriate action would be taken on this matter. In my view, the Defendant’s reply to the Plaintiff’s letter of demand would have made clear that the Defendant was not making any admission of liability to the Plaintiff.</a></p><a id="p1_96"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a><a id="p1_97">97&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the Plaintiff were correct to say that the statements did amount to an admission of liability, that response would have at the very least signalled to the Plaintiff that the Defendant had changed its stance on the matter, having had the benefit of seeking legal advice. I am of the view that the Defendant should be allowed to withdraw the alleged admission. Mr Goh explained that the statement was made without the benefit of legal advice. He was focused on appeasing the public. While the statement could and should have been better drafted, the Defendant clarified matters in short order after seeking legal advice. What is significant is that the Plaintiff did not allege to have suffered irreparable prejudice in the intervening period because of the earlier stance taken by the Defendant (see <em>Re Rocco Celestino v Antonio Celestino</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('http://classic.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinosrch.cgi?results=200;query=au/cases/cth/FCA/1990/299.html')">[1990] FCA 299</a> at [14], cited with approval in <em>Independent State of Papua New Guinea v PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18514-SSP.xml')">[2016] SGHC 19</a> at [134]; see also <em>Gale v Superdrug Stores plc</em> [1996] 3 All ER 468 and <em>Wong Chee Yuan (Huang Zhiyuan) v Koh Kim Chai</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25406-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGMC 59</a>).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98">98&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff submits that “a legally binding contract” was formed in this case by reason of the Plaintiff accepting the Defendant’s apology in its letter of demand dated 15 September 2021.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a> The Plaintiff cited <em>Shunmugam Jayakumar v Joshua Jeyaretnam Benjamin</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1996] 2 SLR(R) 0658.xml')">[1996] 2 SLR(R) 658</a> (“<em>Shunmugam</em>”), where the court denied the defendants leave to retract an admission of liability because the defendant had agreed under the terms of the compromise to pay damages and costs and are bound by the negative covenant not to repeat the libel (at [20]). In my view, the facts of <em>Shunmugam</em> are entirely different. The defendant in that case, following negotiations with the plaintiff issued a public apology for the “false and baseless allegations” and undertaking not to repeat the allegations and to “pay costs and damages” (at [16]). It was in those circumstances that the court found that that parties have entered into a settlement agreement which the court had no power to unravel (at [40]).

Foodie King went on to publish an article on the contents of the letter of demand.</a></p><a id="p1_102-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_102-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_102-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Yahoo! News Singapore and Mothership published articles on the letter of demand on 20 and 22 September 2021 respectively.</a></p><a id="p1_102-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_103">103&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Aminurrashid admitted to publishing the first page of the letter of demand on his personal Facebook page. He however denied forwarding the letter of demand to Yahoo!

News Singapore and Mothership articles to prove that the Plaintiff had forwarded the letter of demand to them:</a></p><a id="p1_104"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“The owners of Mentai-ya and The Social Outcast told Mothership that letters of demand were sent to Ishiro on Sep. 15 and 16.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Copies of the letters were forwarded to Mothership.”</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“The letters of demand were sent by a team of lawyers – led by lawyer Clarence Lun – from Fervent Law Chambers which was engaged by the two eateries last week.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Both letters, seen by Yahoo News Singapore, state that Ishiro had caused and/or allowed employees…”</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a><a id="p1_105">105&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the Defendant failed to lead sufficient evidence to prove that it was the Plaintiff who forwarded the letter of demand to Yahoo! News Singapore and Mothership. First, the news articles themselves were hearsay. As the Defendant did not call the author of those articles as a witness, the veracity of its contents could not be tested in court. Second, and more importantly, the articles made no mention as to who forwarded the letter of demand to Yahoo! News Singapore and Mothership. The Defendant could have called witnesses from these media outlets to testify on this matter. No good reason was given for the Defendant electing not to call them as witnesses. As things stand, it is possible that the media outlets had obtained the letter of demand from other sources, such as the Plaintiff’s solicitors, the Plaintiff’s employees or the Defendant’s employees. While it is entirely possible that the letters were indeed forwarded by the Plaintiff, it remains for the Defendant to lead evidence on this matter to discharge its burden of proof. At the very least, the Defendant should have written to the media outlets to ask from whom they received the letter of demand. Their response would likely have shed much light on this issue. Unfortunately, there is no evidence of the Defendant having taken any such steps to investigate the truth of the matter. It chose to rest its case on speculation.</a></p><a id="p1_105"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a><a id="p1_106">106&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is however undisputed that Mr Aminurrashid published the first page of the letter of demand on his personal Facebook account. It is also undisputed that this was picked up by Foodie King and relied on by Foodie King to publish an online article on the Plaintiff’s allegations. The first page of the letter of demand contained the following statement which the Defendant took issue with in its Counterclaim:<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“… you have caused and/or allowed your employees, including but not limited to Wen Bin and/or Deon Goh, to publish false, derogatory and defamatory comments and posts (the “Defamatory Posts”) against our client through multiple pseudonymous accounts on Facebook and Google.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107">107&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned above, the natural and ordinary meaning of this statement was that the Defendant was complicit in the publication of “false, derogatory and defamatory comments and posts” by its “employees” through “multiple pseudonymous accounts” or at the very least permitted them to do these alleged acts.</a></p><a id="p1_107"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a><a id="p1_108">108&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff argued the defence of justification, namely, that they were true in substance.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a> It also argued the defence of fair comment, namely, that they were made on true facts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span> Since the Plaintiff failed to prove that the Defendant was complicit in the publication of the Defamatory Statements or had permitted its employees to do so, these defences naturally fall away.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109">109&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, the allegation that “employees”, in plural form, namely, more than one employee, were involved in the publication of “false, derogatory and defamatory comments and posts” goes against the weight of the evidence. On the evidence, it is undisputed that the Defamatory Statements were published by Mr Chua alone. It is not the Plaintiff’s case that other employees of the Defendant made the Defamatory Statements. The Plaintiff could not show that there were multiple employees involved in the said publication (see also <em>Ong Kian Peng Julian v Tiong Sze Yin Serene</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25906-SSP.xml')">[2021] 3 SLR 980</a> at [35]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110">110&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allegation that the Defamatory Statements were made through “multiple pseudonymous accounts on Facebook and Google” is also false. It is undisputed that while Mr Chua did use various pseudonyms for his Facebook account through which the Defamatory Statements were posted, the pseudonyms were all linked to a single Facebook account.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a> Further, as mentioned above, the Plaintiff failed to prove that the Google Review Statement was published by Mr Chua. The statement that the Defendant’s employees made defamatory statements on Google is therefore false.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Damages</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111">111&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to assess damages. The Defendant pleaded both general and aggravated damages. The Defendant’s closing submissions however focused on aggravated damages. After perusing parties’ closing submissions, I invited parties to reconsider their claim for aggravated damages, given that the High Court had stated in <em>ATU and others v ATY</em> [2015] 4 SLR 159 (“<em>ATU v ATY</em>”) that it is “settled law that a corporate plaintiff may not recover aggravated damages” (at [60]), a decision that is binding on this court. In response, the Defendant confirmed that it would no longer be pursuing this head of damages. It turned to focus its submissions on general damages.</a></p><a id="p1_111"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a><a id="p1_112">112&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General damages in the tort of defamation serves three principal functions. First, they provide consolation to the claimant for the distress suffered. Second, they repair the reputational harm. Third, they serve to vindicate its reputation (<em>Arul Chandran v Chew Chin Aik Victor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2001] 1 SLR(R) 0086.xml')">[2001] 1 SLR(R) 86</a> at [53]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113">113&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining the appropriate quantum of general damages to be awarded, the court takes into account a broad spectrum of factors that includes the following (<em>Lim Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wei</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 4 SLR 0357.xml')">[2010] 4 SLR 357</a> at [7]-[9]):</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_113-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the nature and gravity of the defamation;</a></p><a id="p1_113-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_113-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_113-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the conduct, position and standing of the plaintiff and the defendant;</a></p><a id="p1_113-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_113-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_113-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mode and extent of publication;</a></p><a id="p1_113-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_113-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_113-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the natural indignation of the court at the injury caused to the plaintiff;</a></p><a id="p1_113-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_113-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_113-p2_e">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the conduct of the defendant from the time the defamatory statement is published to the very moment of the verdict;</a></p><a id="p1_113-p2_e"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_113-p2_e"></a><a id="p1_113-p2_f">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the failure to apologise and retract the defamatory statement;</a></p><a id="p1_113-p2_f"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_113-p2_f"></a><a id="p1_113-p2_g">(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the presence of malice; and</a></p><a id="p1_113-p2_g"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_113-p2_g"></a><a id="p1_113-p2_h">(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its intended deterrent effect.</a></p><a id="p1_113-p2_h"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113-p2_h"></a><a id="p1_114">114&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also common practice for the court to look to past cases for guidance. Comparable cases can provide guidance on the appropriate amount of damages to award in a particular case (<em>Lee Hsien Loong v Singapore Democratic Party</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2009] 1 SLR(R) 0642.xml')">[2009] 1 SLR(R) 642</a> at [73]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115">115&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant sought the sum of $63,000. In my view, that amount is excessive and departs from established case precedents. The Defendant sought to rely on <em>ATU v ATY</em>, where the court awarded $30,000 to the corporate plaintiff against accusations that it had participated in sexual abuse of young, elementary school children. While the allegations in that case were similarly published to various individuals and the press, they were far more serious and debilitating than the present defamatory statements made by the Plaintiff. Further, the corporate plaintiff in that case was “well known within the international school community” (at [34]). In contrast, there is no evidence of the Defendant having any reputational outreach beyond Singapore. Given these differences, I am of the view that general damages in the present case should be lower than $30,000.</a></p><a id="p1_115"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a><a id="p1_116">116&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Golden Season</em> offers another point of comparison. In that case, the defendants suggested in a Facebook post and emails to various individuals and organisations that the defendants had been cheated by the plaintiffs and suggested copyright infringement. The court awarded general damages to the corporate plaintiff in the sum of $15,000.</a></p><a id="p1_116"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a><a id="p1_117">117&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Hunger Busters Pte Ltd v Jonathan Cheok Wei Zheng</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24641-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGDC 129</a> (“<em>Hunger Busters</em>”) is a recent decision also involving defamatory statements published on social media. In that case, the defendant posted comments on Facebook and Instagram which suggested that the corporate plaintiff was dishonest or involved in some form of business misconduct. The court awarded $10,000 in general damages. In arriving at this amount, the court highlighted that the plaintiff’s business had been in operation for less than a month at the time the defamatory posts were published.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118">118&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having regard to the above case precedents and the present facts, I award general damages to the Defendant in the sum of $15,000. This amount is higher than the $10,000 awarded in <em>Hunger Busters</em> because the Defendant was certainly not a newly minted company at the time of the publication. It had several branches of Ishiro across Singapore at the time the Plaintiff published the defamatory remarks.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_104" id="Ftn_104_1"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a> This is the same amount awarded in <em>Golden Season</em>. While the publication in the present case did result in repetition by the press for which the Plaintiff should be responsible (<em>ATU v ATY</em> at [38]-[41]), whereas there was no such publication in <em>Golden Season</em>, the allegations in <em>Golden Season</em> involving cheating could also be said to be more serious than the defamatory remarks made in the present case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119">119&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For completeness, I deal with the issue of special damages. In defamation suits, special damages denote particular damage which a claimant suffers beyond general damage (<em>ATU v ATY</em> at [69]). It is trite that special damages have to be specifically pleaded and proven (<em>ATU v ATY</em> at [69]). In the present case, the Defendant’s Mr Goh mentioned in his AEIC that its business suffered losses amounting to $63,000 in the months after the Plaintiff published the defamatory statements.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a> However, this was not specifically pleaded. Further, as the Defendant conceded in its written submissions, such losses could be attributed to other causes such as the Covid-19 pandemic, and it is hard to show that it was caused by the defamatory statement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span> In fact, the drop in sales could also be attributed to the fallout from the Mentai-Ya video, including the manner in which it was handled by the Defendant. The Defendant clarified that the purported losses were highlighted merely to show that the amount of general damages sought is reasonable.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span> Since such losses were neither specifically pleaded nor credibly proven, I am unable to accord much weight to this piece of evidence. I also make no finding on special damages since it was not sought.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120">120&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the above reasons, I dismiss the Plaintiff’s claim. On the evidence, the Defamatory Statements were published by Mr Chua. While the Plaintiff was undoubtedly defamed, it should have sued Mr Chua. The Defendant happened to be his employer at the time of the publication. In choosing to sue the Defendant, the Plaintiff ought to prove that the Defendant had participated in the defamation. It failed to do so.</a></p><a id="p1_120"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a><a id="p1_121">121&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I allow the Defendant’s counterclaim in part. It is undisputed that the Plaintiff, through Mr Aminurrashid, published the front page of its letter of demand to third parties. I found that the published contents implied that the Defendant was complicit in or had permitted the publication of the Defamatory Statements. The published contents are defamatory. I assess general damages at $15,000.</a></p><a id="p1_121"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a><a id="p1_122">122&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will hear parties on costs.
