He insisted that she rest at home instead. Laiu felt that the accused was behaving in a paranoid manner and called her ex-husband Steven Tan Chun Yang (“Tan”) for help.

He was sleeping on a sofa in an area of the hall which had been partitioned for his sole use. The police found some drug paraphernalia on the table next to him. This included Exhibit P6, which was an “improvised bottle with glass bong and straw attached”. Exhibit P6 was the subject matter of the second charge. It was not in dispute that it was an improvised utensil used for smoking methamphetamine.</a></p><a id="p1_9"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officers tried to wake the accused and lifted him to a standing position. They found a blue pouch on the sofa, which had been underneath him. In it, they found a sachet of white crystallised substance and a blue straw (Exhibit P8) together with other drug taking paraphernalia. The accused was then placed under arrest.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exhibit P8 was sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis.

This was documented in two medical reports dated 20 October 2020 (Exhibit P9) and 22 March 2021 (Exhibit P10) which were put up by Dr Jonathan Lee Jie, Psychiatrist, Associate Consultant, Institute of Mental Health (“Dr Lee”) (PW7).</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Exhibit P10, Dr Lee opined that the accused was suffering from schizoaffective disorder and that he had a history of substance abuse. Dr Lee stated that there was no significant contributory link between his mental illness and the alleged offences. Dr Lee certified that the accused was not of unsound mind at the time of the alleged offences and that he was fit to plead in a Court of Law.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issue</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main issue to be determined was whether the accused knew at the time of his arrest on 21 July 2020, that Exhibit P8 contained methamphetamine and that Exhibit P6 was a utensil intended for the consumption of drugs.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prosecution submitted that the accused had actual knowledge of these matters. Alternatively, for the drug possession charge, it submitted that the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (“MDA”) applied, but that the accused failed to rebut it.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the accused denied having any knowledge that Exhibit P8 contained methamphetamine or knowing the purpose of Exhibit P6.</a></p><a id="p1_17"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id=""> <b>Evaluation of evidence and findings</b> </a></p><a id=""> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The accused knew that Exhibit P8 contained methamphetamine</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To show that the accused knew that Exhibit P8 contained methamphetamine, and that Exhibit P6 was a drug utensil used to consume it, the prosecution relied on the medical reports from the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”), Exhibits P9 and P10.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exhibit P9 documented the accused’s admission to IMH from 19 August 2020 to 5 September 2020 for a mild relapse of his schizoaffective disorder. Dr Lee saw the accused once during this admission.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exhibit P9 stated at [3], “He [the accused] informed us the police had found drugs at his house and that it was his old stock.” This indicated that the accused knew that what the police found (Exhibit P8) contained drugs. It should be noted that HSA’s drug certificate (Exhibit P7) (which found Exhibit P8 to contain methamphetamine) was dated 19 August 2020 i.e. the same date as the accused’s admission to IMH. It was most unlikely that the accused would have been informed or known of the contents of Exhibit P7 at the time of his admission. Notwithstanding this, he was able to definitively state that the police found drugs at his house. He even tried to minimize his culpability and claimed that the drugs were his “old stock”.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee saw the accused on 7 January 2021 and 5 March 2021 for the purposes of preparing a forensic report. In Exhibit P10, Dr Lee stated at [11] that the accused’s account of the alleged offences was as follows:-</a></p><a id="p1_21"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subject stated that he was not aware of the charges he is facing. The charges were read to him. He was inconsistent in his accounts of the alleged offences. He stated that he came into possession of the drug and the “bong” through a friend who passed it to him during a barbeque “a long time ago”. In an earlier account, he stated that he was unaware of the content of the substance. In a later account, he said that he was aware it was “ICE” because the people who gave it to him told him so…</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the accused may have given Dr Lee inconsistent accounts, he eventually admitted that he was aware that the drugs were “ice” (the street name for methamphetamine). He thus voluntarily provided inculpatory information on matters which were adverse to him, and which were within his own knowledge. There was no reason to doubt the truth of his admission. He even provided a cogent reason for his belief that the substance was “ice” i.e. the people who gave it to him told him so. He would thus have known that Exhibit P8 contained methamphetamine. He also referred to Exhibit P6 as a “bong”, which is a utensil used to smoke drugs.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no reason to doubt the reliability of the IMH records. Dr Lee testified that he kept contemporaneous records of what the accused said. While speaking to the accused, he would type his discussion notes with the accused directly into his computer.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a> The accused did not challenge the evidence of Dr Lee or the adverse parts of the IMH reports, even when these were pointed out to him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Instead, he stated:-<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">I would just like to inform Your Honour that the drugs were not my old stock, but rather it was from the previous batch of stock.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exhibit P10 documented at [9], the accused’s eight admissions to IMH between 2014 and 2020. He refused to provide his urine for drug screening, except during an admission in 2017. On this occasion, his urine tested positive for methamphetamine. The accused did not challenge this evidence, which indicated that he had previously consumed methamphetamine. It was thus probable that he was familiar with methamphetamine and the utensils used for consuming it. This would go towards negativing his claim that he did not know that the crystalline substance (Exhibit P8) contained methamphetamine and that the “bong” (Exhibit P6) was used to consume drugs.</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the accused conceded in cross-examination that at the time of his arrest, he knew that Exhibit P8 contained “ice”:-<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, at the time that P8 was seized from you on 21st July 2020, you knew that it contained Ice.

I agreed with the prosecution that the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA was triggered, and that the accused would be presumed, until the contrary was proved, to have known the nature of that drug. The accused was thus presumed to know that Exhibit P8 contained methamphetamine.</a></p><a id="p1_28"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To rebut the presumption, the accused had to prove on the balance of probabilities, that he did not have knowledge of the nature of the drug.

There were two attachments to the main body of the device. There was a glass bulb which is known as a “pop-eye”. The second attachment was a straw. There was a small opening on top of the glass bulb through which “ice” would be inserted. To consume “ice”, the user would use a small flame to heat the glass bulb from below. The user would then inhale the fumes which were released by using the straw. Water could also be poured into the bottle for filtration. From his experience, this type of devise was only used for “ice”. He had never come across cases where this kind of utensil was used for anything other than methamphetamine.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exhibits P6 and P8 had been left together with the accused.
