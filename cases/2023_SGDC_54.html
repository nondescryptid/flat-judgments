This category of offences includes the production or distribution of materials depicting the sexual abuse of a child. Beyond the horrific physical and psychological harm suffered by the child in the production of such materials, the child’s suffering can be indefinitely prolonged when such materials are distributed over the Internet; with many child victims experiencing “fear, guilt, shame and betrayal” whilst “constantly worrying about being recognised by someone who had viewed” the materials showing their abuse (Coen Teunissen and Sarah Napier, Australian Institute of Criminology, “Child sexual abuse material and end-to-end encryption on social media platforms: An overview” (No 653, July 2022), at p 1).</a></p><a id="p1_1"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2019, Parliament updated the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) by enacting specific laws against child abuse material (“CAM”), a term defined in section 377C(1) of the Penal Code. Recognising that “terrible harm is caused to these children who are used in the production of [child abuse] material”, Parliament criminalised “the spectrum of offences to deal with every person involved, from consumers to the producers of such material” (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (6 May 2019) vol 94 (“<em>Parliamentary Debates</em>”) (K Shanmugam, Minister for Home Affairs)). This led to the enactment of provisions such as section 377BI of the Penal Code, which prescribes that an offender who distributes CAM, and who knows or has reason to believe that the material is CAM, shall on conviction be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, and shall also be liable to fine or caning.</a></p><a id="p1_2"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hindakumbure Charindu Dilshan Rajapaksha (“the Accused”) is the second person prosecuted under section 377BI of the Penal Code. From 16 March 2020 to 24 July 2020, the Accused distributed 17 films containing CAM in a WhatsApp chat group he was one of the administrators of, which had a total of 256 participants when these films were disseminated. As described by the Prosecution, the content of these films “scrape the very pits of depravity - they involve children being raped, possibly being trafficked into sex, and in one clip a prepubescent child filmed having sex with a farmyard animal”.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a> The Accused is also charged for a separate offence under section 292(1)(a) of the Penal Code, for having transmitted 943 obscene films (which do not include the 17 films containing CAM) in the same WhatsApp chat group.

At the material time, Dilshan had been studying hospitality management in Singapore for approximately two years. He was married and has a three-year-old child.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The connected accused person is Mr Kolambage Dhanushka Chamara Perera (“<b>Kolambage</b>”), a male Sri Lankan national. Kolambage was also a hospitality management student in Singapore.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Constable Sergeant Gregory Tan Jun Jie (“<b>Sgt Gregory</b>”), a male Singaporean, was at the material time serving his full-time National Service as a Foot Patrol Officer with the Public Transport Security Command.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b><u>BACKGROUND FACTS</u></b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 6 August 2020, Sgt Gregory was conducting foot patrol at the concourse area of Lavender MRT Station, Singapore, when he spotted Kolambage behaving suspiciously. Sgt Gregory and his colleagues conducted a check on him.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of the officers’ engagement, the officers noticed that Kolambage had a group chat with a display picture that showed the silhouette of a male and female engaged in sex. The officers opened the group chat and saw that the said group chat had over 6,000 obscene videos and files (some of which were child pornography materials).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same day at or about 3.59pm, Kolambage was arrested at 50 Kallang Road, Lavender MRT Station, Singapore. One black iPhone 7 which had been in Kolambage’s possession (“<b>Kolambage’s iPhone</b>”) and which belonged to Kolambage was also seized by the police.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 7 February 2022, Kolambage pleaded guilty to one charge under s377BK(1) p/u s 377BK(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) for having in his possession 25 video files constituting child abuse material, with one charge under s 30(1) of the Films Act (Cap 107, 1998 Rev Ed) taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. Kolambage had automatically downloaded such material into his phone. He was sentenced to one month’s imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Kolambage’s arrest, Dilshan was traced as one of the admins of the said group chat. On 12 August 2020, the Police gave Dilshan a call asking him to return to his unit. When he returned, they checked Dilshan’s phone and found the said group chat. He admitted to being an active participant who sent pornographic materials in the said group chat. Dilshan was then arrested at about 12.30pm and his iPhone, with Whatsapp number +65 … 6631, was seized as a case exhibit. Before he was arrested, Dilshan had deleted the videos and the accompanying messages from his WhatsApp. The offending material was only retrieved from Kolambage’s iPhone.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b><em>The Wela Group Chat</em></b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime between 2019 and early 2020, Dilshan and his six roommates created a Whatsapp group chat. The group chat was soon named partially in the English language and partially in Sinhalese language, and which had an ‘emoji’ icon in the chat name, to - “Singapore Boys (Singapore flag ‘emoji’ icon) Wela group” (the “<b>Wela Group Chat</b>”). This was the said group chat that Sgt Gregory had discovered in Kolambage’s phone. <em>Wela</em>, in Sinhalese, literally refers to a person who commits sexually indecent acts. In the Wela Group Chat, the terms <em>wel, wela</em>, and <em>wal</em> were used as terms for porn or sexual content.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dilshan is one of seven admins of the Wela Group Chat and was an active participant – between 16 March 2020 to 3 August 2020 alone, Dilshan sent about 2,800 messages on the Wela Group Chat, including forwarding vast amounts of pornographic material.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dilshan and other participants of the Wela Group Chat invited other Sri Lankans to join the Wela Group Chat. Dilshan and about three to four others would share pornographic materials in the Wela Group Chat. By the time the Wela Group Chat was discovered by the Police, there had been at all points in time a total of 520 participants who had joined the Wela Group Chat (of which 256 members were active) (WhatsApp allows a maximum of 256 participants) and the vast majority of the messages was pornographic material. Only occasionally would the group be sharing news from home.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b><em>Dilshan’s activity on the Wela Group Chat</em></b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dilshan actively added participants into the Wela Group Chat, such as his roommate Mr Undiya Ralalage Harshan Hinod Dharmasiri, Kolambage and multiple other persons. He would do so in multiple ways: (1) by sending a link in the Wela Group Chat for participants to send to other potential participants (this was done on at least 15 occasions), (2) adding participants directly to the Wela Group Chat by sending them a link to the Wela Group Chat or (3) adding their WhatsApp account to the Wela Group Chat (this was done on at least 4 occasions). For example, with Kolambage, Dilshan had met him at Kolambage’s home and told him about the Wela Group Chat, asked for his number and then sent him the invitation link.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from sending the link on the Wela Group Chat itself or to individuals, Dilshan would also urge members in the Wela Group Chat to invite others onto the group chat. He would also post the link to the Wela Group Chat to other chat groups where pornographic materials were being shared; this was done in at least 2 other chat groups – “We Are Sri Lankans” and “Golden Country” – which had at all points in time contained 232 and 358 participants respectively (of which 256 members were active) by the time that Dilshan’s iPhone was seized by the Police.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dilshan actively shared pornographic materials on various WhatsApp group chats where participants would make requests for pornographic materials, this included the Wela Group Chat.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On occasion, others would make specific requests on the Wela Group Chat for films involving “child porn”, “rape” or “BDSM”:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="10.62%"><col width="23.86%"><col width="16.9%"><col width="27.14%"><col width="21.48%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class="br" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>S/N</b> </p> </td><td class="br" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Sender (number)</b> </p> </td><td class="br" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Date &amp;

The focus of the Defence’s mitigation was targeted at the level of culpability of the Accused, which the Defence sought to convince the Court was at the low end.

Each of the 17 films containing CAM had been forwarded in bulk with various other pornographic materials. This shows, in the Defence’s view, the Accused’s “low level of proclivity” towards CAM.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar to the Prosecution, the Defence relied significantly on <em>Alvin Tay</em> when calibrating the sentence to be imposed in the present case.

In the Defence’s view, the s 377BI PC offence “factually constitutes a part of” the s 292(1)(a) PC offence, given that the 17 films containing CAM are part of the other obscene materials forwarded by the Accused.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Furthermore, the gravity of the offences as a whole would be adequately reflected in the imposition of the sentence for the s 377BI PC offence, as that is the more serious offence and can be considered “an aggravated form” of the s 292(1)(a) PC offence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Finally, the Defence also highlighted that in <em>Alvin Tay</em>, the sentence for the s 377BI offence (<em>ie</em>, 8 months’ imprisonment) was ordered to run concurrently with a separate offence under section 377BC of the Penal Code (<em>ie</em>, the distribution of 320 voyeuristic images and recordings), even though the two offences involve “different types of obscene material” (<em>ie</em>, voyeuristic images and recordings on one hand, and CAM on the other).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Court’s Decision on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The sentence for the s 292(1)(a) PC offence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 292(1)(a) of the Penal Code states that whoever transmits by electronic means any obscene object shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 months, or with fine, or with both. It has been explained that the purpose of a provision like section 292(1)(a) of the Penal Code is to protect or shield the public from moral corruption, in particular those who are “most clearly at risk [such as the] very young or the psychologically disturbed” (<em>Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts</em> (LexisNexis, 3<sup>rd</sup> Ed, 2013) (“<em>Sentencing Practice</em>”) at p 619, which was cited with approval in <em>Chan Chun Hong</em> at [29]). Both the Prosecution and the Defence calibrated their proposed sentences for the s 292(1)(a) PC offence by relying on the reported decisions in <em>Luo Zhiang</em> and <em>Chan Chun Hong</em>, which I shall now address.</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Luo Zhiang</em>, the offender pleaded guilty to one charge under section 292(1)(a) of the Penal Code for uploading, to a pornographic website, a video he had taken of his female colleague changing. The victim’s face was visible and it showed her clad in her undergarments. The offender was sentenced to 2 months’ imprisonment for the offence under section 292(1)(a) of the Penal Code, on top of the separate sentences he had received for the act of taking photographs and videos of his colleagues changing. When calibrating the sentence for the section 292(1)(a) Penal Code offence, the Court reasoned as follows (<em>Luo Zhiang</em> at [32]):</a></p><a id="p1_25"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The factors which influence the sentence include the degree and type of obscenity together with the form in which it is presented; the scale; and to whom the publication was made to. I noted that the video clip was uploaded onto a pornographic site and the victim’s face was visible. However, there was no extreme obscenity to warrant a sentence that was two weeks’ short of the maximum punishment. Accordingly I determined a sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment to be appropriate.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Chan Chun Hong</em>, the offender had registered an account on various online platforms for the purpose of transmitting CAM to and receiving CAM from other users. He then sent seven different emails (to seven individual email addresses) transmitting between 12 to 50 photos/videos containing CAM in each email, for the purposes of trading pictures and videos of girls below 10 or 12 years old. The Accused pleaded guilty to seven charges under section 292(1)(a) of the Penal Code. In reaching the decision to impose a sentence of 2 months’ imprisonment for each of the section 292(1)(a) Penal Code charge, the Court considered the egregious content of the photos/videos transmitted, the fact that the offender had made no commercial gain, the images were not distributed to the public at large, and that the bulk of the offences were committed when the offender was suffering from depression (<em>Chan Chun Hong</em> at [31]).</a></p><a id="p1_26"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, the Accused had transmitted, to an extremely large group of 256 individuals each time, highly obscene materials such as films which depict rape, “bondage, discipline, sadism and masochism” (“BDSM”) sexual activity, and bestiality.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a> Crucially, the quantity of obscene films transmitted (943 films) as stated in the single section 292(1)(a) Penal Code charge far exceeds the number of obscene materials the offenders in <em>Luo Zhiang</em> and <em>Chan Chun Hong</em> had transmitted. While the Defence recognised that these are highly aggravating factors, it submitted that these factors are counter-balanced by the following differences between the Accused’s case and the reported precedents:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike in <em>Luo Zhiang</em>, the Accused was not in anyway involved in the making or producing of the obscene films.

An uplift of the sentence to be imposed in the present case is warranted given the sheer number (943) of obscene films transmitted by the Accused, many of which contain materials which are far more objectionable than what was transmitted by the offender in <em>Luo Zhiang</em>.</a></p><a id="p1_28-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_28-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Accused did not expressly request for obscene materials or CAM in exchange unlike the offender in <em>Chan Chun Hong</em>, I do not think a clear distinction in culpability exists in this regard when one considers that the Accused had committed the s 292(1)(a) PC offence as the <em>administrator</em> of the “Wela Group Chat”, which by 6 August 2020, had “over 6,000 obscene videos and files” being circulated.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a> While the Accused might not have expressly requested for obscene materials in exchange, the factual context suggests that there was no need for him to do so.

In the PCRC Report, the PCRC noted that there were “no specific offences involving child pornography, and a current patchwork of laws exist to address offences involving pornography” (PCRC Report at p 124). The PCRC observed that (PCRC Report at p 125):</a></p><a id="p1_30"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_30-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;technological developments have “not just facilitated the distribution of child pornography, but the <em>demand</em> for it as well”;</a></p><a id="p1_30-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_30-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there has been a rise in the “commercial sexual exploitation of minors”; and</a></p><a id="p1_30-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_30-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even in cases where there is no sexual penetration of the child in the production of CAM, “the psychological damage [to the child] is serious….most children who engage in sexual acts for the production of pornography report dysfunctional sexualized behaviour, feelings of worthlessness and shame”.</a></p><a id="p1_30-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PCRC concluded that our laws as of August 2018 were “inadequate to address the serious problem that the rise of the Internet has created for offences such as child pornography” (PCRC Report at p 125). It recommended that new offences be enacted to “deal with the entire ecosystem of offences perpetrated in the production, distribution, and consumption of [CAM], taking into account the rapid development of technology and the Internet” (PCRC Report at p 126).</a></p><a id="p1_31"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation of the proposed punishments for the new offences targeting CAM, the PCRC observed that the penal provisions which previously used to cover offences involving child pornography (such as section 292 of the Penal Code) are “inappropriate …. points of reference [as they] do not have the objective of protecting children from abuse, and are unsuitable to meet the modern issues presented by the Internet” (PCRC Report at p 131). The PCRC reasoned that the punishments prescribed for the new offences should be “sufficient to act as a denunciation of [CAM] and a general deterrent to protect children from abuse” (PRCR Report at p 131). For the proposed offence of distributing CAM, the PCRC recommended that the punishment be a mandatory imprisonment term for up to 7 years, with discretionary caning, and discretionary fine.</a></p><a id="p1_32"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PCRC recommendation for a standalone offence targeting the distribution of CAM (with a mandatory imprisonment term for up to 7 years, with the possibility of fine and caning) was adopted by Parliament on 6 May 2019 (see above at [2]). This led to the enactment of section 377BI of the Penal Code in its current form. The dual, principal concerns of the harm caused to children and the scale in which CAM is being disseminated today were similarly voiced during the parliamentary debates:</a></p><a id="p1_33"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33"></a><a id="p1_33-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The global market for [CAM] is growing at an alarming speed, "aided" by advances in technology and the World Wide Web.

In determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed for a s 377BI PC offence, the Court should keep in mind the extent of <em>harm</em> caused to children in the distribution of the CAM and the <em>scale</em> at which the CAM in question was distributed, given that these were the primary concerns highlighted by both the PCRC and Parliament.</a></p><a id="p1_34"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a relatively new offence on the books which was introduced partly because the previous punishment provisions were deemed inadequate, the Court in sentencing an offender for a section 377BI Penal Code offence must also be especially attuned to whether it is utilising the full sentencing range prescribed (see <em>Wong Tian Jun De Beers v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29028-SSP.xml')">[2022] 4 SLR 805</a> at [56] and [58]). This is to avoid, amongst other things, sentences being “clustered around the lower end of the statutorily prescribed range” (<em>Public Prosecutor v GED and other appeals</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29054-SSP.xml')">[2022] SGHC 301</a> (“<em>GED</em>”) at [2]), which can gradually result in “a sentencing trend [that is] inconsistent with Parliament’s stance with respect to” the purpose behind why section 377BI of the Penal Code had to be enacted in the first place (<em>Tan Song Cheng v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/26946-SSP.xml')">[2021] 5 SLR 789</a> (“<em>Tan Song Cheng</em>”) at [26]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, both the Prosecution and Defence did not – rightfully, in my view – request for a sentencing framework or sentencing benchmarks to be laid down, given that this is a court of first instance and no prior case law on section 377BI of the Penal Code exists (see <em>Kwan Weiguang v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29469-SSP.xml')">[2022] 5 SLR 766</a> at [44] and <em>Public Prosecutor v Sindok Trading Pte Ltd (now known as BSS Global Pte Ltd) and other appeals</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29398-SSP.xml')">[2022] 5 SLR 336</a> at [29]). Instead, both parties proposed a set of <em>sentencing factors</em> the Court should consider when calibrating the sentence, namely, factors going towards the harm caused by the offence and factors going towards the offender’s culpability.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having submitted on the extent in which these factors are engaged on the present facts, both parties then proceeded to calibrate the proposed sentence by relying significantly on the facts and the sentence imposed in <em>Alvin Tay</em> (see above at [13] and [20]). During oral submissions, I expressed my concern that such an approach may be problematic because <em>Alvin Tay</em> is an unreported decision. The High Court has cautioned, on a number of occasions, that “sentencing precedents without grounds or explanations should bear little, if any, weight [as] it will not be possible in such cases to discern what had weighed on the mind of the sentencing judge or why the sentencing judge had approached the matter in a particular way” (<em>Janardana Jayasankarr v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19421-SSP.xml')">[2016] 4 SLR 1288</a> at [13(b)]; see also <em>Keeping Mark John v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21201-SSP.xml')">[2017] 5 SLR 627</a> at [18] and <em>Tan Song Cheng</em> at [25]). This common refrain rings even louder in the present situation, when all that is available to the Court to take reference from is a single, unreported decision, and not even a body of unreported precedents.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances, I am of the view that the better approach would be for the Court – and parties assisting the Court as well – to simply calibrate the appropriate sentence in the present case based on the sentencing factors it considers relevant <em>and</em> the full sentencing range prescribed by Parliament for the offence. As mentioned earlier at [14], when the Prosecution took up the Court’s suggestion during oral submissions to do so, the proposed sentence which it came to accept is justifiable on the facts (<em>ie</em>, 2 years’ imprisonment) differs materially from the sentence it had originally proposed in its written submissions (<em>ie</em>, 9 to 12 months’ imprisonment), the latter being calibrated using <em>Alvin Tay</em> as a reference point. In my view, this anomaly concretely illustrates the need for caution when relying on unreported decisions so as to avoid “the dangers of the “anchoring effect”” (<em>GED</em> at [128]), both by the Court and the Prosecution alike.</a></p><a id="p1_38"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach I will adopt in determining the sentence to be imposed for the s 377BI PC offence will be as follows: I will first set out what I consider to be relevant offence-specific factors to come to a view of whether, on the facts, the harm caused is best described as slight, moderate or severe; and whether the culpability of the Accused is best described as low, medium or high. With this information, I will then identify an indicative sentence based on the full sentencing range statutorily prescribed for the s 377BI PC offence (<em>ie</em>, 7 years’ imprisonment). Finally, I will make adjustments to derive the eventual sentence to be imposed by taking into account relevant offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors. For the avoidance of doubt, I am <em>not</em> prescribing a sentencing framework to be applied to <em>all</em> section 377BI Penal Code offences or other related offences. I am simply describing – and thereafter applying – what I consider to be an analytically and juristically sound approach to determine the just and appropriate sentence for the s 377BI PC offence <em>in the present case</em>.</a></p><a id="p1_39"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a><a id="p1_40">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now turn to the list of non-exhaustive offence-specific factors which I find relevant in the calibration of the appropriate sentence for the s 377BI PC offence.</a></p><a id="p1_40"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The relevant sentencing factors</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Factors going towards harm</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a><a id="p1_41">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before setting out the factors going towards harm which I consider relevant, I wish to address an important point which the Defence highlighted in its oral submissions, which is that the Court must take care to ensure that the Accused is being punished for <em>distributing</em> CAM, and not for <em>producing</em> it, the latter being a more serious offence prescribed under section 377BH of the Penal Code (with a maximum imprisonment term of up to 10 years).</a></p><a id="p1_41"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a><a id="p1_42">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument which the Defence alluded to appears to be this: At the point when the CAM is distributed, the child who was filmed would already have been physically and/or psychologically harmed by whoever was responsible in the production of the film. It is therefore legally and morally questionable for the aforementioned harm suffered by the child to be pinned on the person distributing the film unthinkingly as if he was the one responsible in producing it, when in most cases – like the present one – the offender would not have been involved at all in the production or initial distribution of the film.</a></p><a id="p1_42"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a><a id="p1_43">43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This argument serves as a reminder that in order to justly punish an offender for a section 377BI Penal Code offence, the Court ought first have a clear grasp of the harm which is caused in the distribution of CAM. What exactly is the harm caused when an offender (who is uninvolved in the production or initial distribution of the CAM) distributes CAM? In my view, there are at least three types of harm which can be said to be engaged:</a></p><a id="p1_43"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43"></a><a id="p1_43-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the distribution of CAM is harmful because it can lead to the <em>re-victimisation of the child</em> involved in the film. This has been alluded to above at [1], in that when such materials are disseminated over the Internet, and this is known to the child, it can prolong or deepen his or her psychological suffering. The manner in which the child is being sexually objectified – not just by the initial perpetrator but countless viewers worldwide – can also cause him or her to internalise this dehumanising perspective, resulting in “feelings of worthlessness and shame” (the PCRC Report at p 125).</a></p><a id="p1_43-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_43-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the distribution of CAM is harmful because it can lead to the <em>normalisation of, or desensitisation towards, child abuse</em>, which in turn can lead to more children being abused. It has been reported that “the majority of those possessing and distributing [CAM] also commit hands-on sexual offenses against minors” (RAINN, “What is Child Sexual Abuse Material” &lt;www.rainn.org/news/what-child-sexual-abuse-material-csam#&gt; (25 August 2022)). Even for those who do not end up committing “hands-on” offences against children, once they are desensitised and habitualised to seek a greater variety of CAM, they inevitably perpetuate the “vicious cycle of demand that allows for horrific acts to occur to <em>new children</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a> This is the basis in which the PCRC concluded that “users [of CAM] are <em>complicit</em> in the abuse involved in the production of the image [containing CAM]” (the PCRC Report at p 129). The same is true for those who distribute CAM as well.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the distribution of CAM is harmful because facilitating the viewing of CAM for morally illegitimate reasons <em>violates the dignity or inherent value of the child</em>. On this view, the distribution of CAM is <em>intrinsically</em> harmful. It is an act which dehumanises and objectifies a child, thereby violating his or her dignity, regardless of whether the child is aware of or consciously affected by the act of distribution, or whether other children may be subsequently abused in the process. By contrast, when the same CAM is distributed or possessed for morally legitimate reasons (such as for the reasons listed under section 377BN(2)(a) of the Penal Code), the dignity of the child is not violated, and neither harm nor crime is established.</a></p><a id="p1_43-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_44">44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have briefly sketched out the various ways one can understand how the distribution of CAM – independent of its production – is harmful. For all their differences, these explanations do converge in the practical recognition that the extent of harm suffered by the child in the production of a particular CAM is a good proxy for the extent of harm caused in the distribution of the same. A film where the child is <em>greatly harmed</em> in the production (for example, where she suffers sexual abuse of a violent nature) is likely to cause greater harm as well when distributed because the act of distribution can result in the child being re-victimised more severely, lead to a more extreme form of desensitisation towards child abuse, and/or more egregiously violates the dignity of the child.</a></p><a id="p1_44"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a><a id="p1_45">45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this point clarified, I shall now set out a list of non-exhaustive factors going towards harm in a section 377BI Penal Code offence which I am of the view are relevant.</a></p><a id="p1_45"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a><a id="p1_46">46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The egregiousness of the nature of the sexual act on display in the CAM</em>. This follows plainly from the discussion above. The “more intrusive and the more overtly sexual the nature of the acts … shown[,] the higher the degree of objective harm that will generally be caused, all else being equal” (<em>GED</em> at [51]). Less egregious content might include still images of children photographed naked. Egregious content might include films depicting children involved in sexual activities with another person, while even more egregious content might include films depicting children being subject to <em>penetrative</em> sexual activity (which, by definition, is rape), BDSM, gratuitous violence or acts of bestiality.</a></p><a id="p1_46"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a><a id="p1_47">47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The extent in which the child appears to be in pain or in distress in the CAM.</em> While it is self-evident that greater harm is caused when the CAM involves a child being subject to greater pain or distress, I agree with the Prosecution that the court must also take care to note that the fact that a child does not express that he or she is in pain or in distress in the CAM does not mean he or she is not traumatised, as the child could be habituated or abused to an extent where he or she does not express these emotions.</a></p><a id="p1_47"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a><a id="p1_48">48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The age or vulnerability of the child in the CAM.</em> If the child in question appears to be much younger than the stipulated age ceiling of 16 years old (<em>ie</em>, the child is prepubescent, or even worse, a toddler), greater harm is caused (<em>GBR v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21698-SSP.xml')">[2018] 3 SLR 1048</a> at [29(f)]). Similarly, greater harm is caused if the child in question appears to be suffering from a mental or physical disability, or if it is obvious that he or she “has a relationship with the [person producing the CAM] that renders the [child] susceptible to being manipulated or taken advantage of” (<em>GED</em> at [61]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49">49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The degree of identifiability of the child in the CAM.</em> The more identifiable the child is, the higher the degree of harm that will generally be caused when such films are distributed. Besides how clearly the face of the child is shown in the CAM, the court may also consider whether the child’s name “or other forms of identification are disclosed” in the CAM (<em>GED</em> at [52]).</a></p><a id="p1_49"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a><a id="p1_50">50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Evidence of commercialisation or child trafficking within the CAM.</em> A commercialised set-up or the presence of indicators that there is child trafficking involved would suggest that the CAM in question is produced or distributed for profit. Distribution of such material increases the harm caused to the child in question (as he or she may be repeatedly abused) and other children in general, as it is likely to incentivise the production of more of such materials. Indicators of commercialisation may include the filming quality of the CAM and the presence of “studios” used, while indicators of child trafficking may include the existence of multiple children in the film and/or evidence of the children filmed being addicted to drugs.</a></p><a id="p1_50"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a><a id="p1_51">51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The nature and extent of the distribution of the CAM</em>. The more persons the CAM has been distributed to by the offender, the greater is the harm caused to the child or children in general. As mentioned above at [34], this is one of the key concerns expressed by the PCRC and Parliament. Significant weight, in my view, should be placed on this factor when calibrating the harm caused.</a></p><a id="p1_51"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a><a id="p1_52">52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The profile of the recipients the CAM is distributed to.</em> If the CAM is distributed to individuals seeking CAM, or in a forum or platform set up to exchange CAM, this increases the harm caused as such distribution would likely fuel the demand for and increase the risk of further child sexual abuse.</a></p><a id="p1_52"> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Factors going towards culpability </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a><a id="p1_53">53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now set out a list of non-exhaustive factors going towards culpability which are, in my view, relevant to a section 377BI Penal Code offence.</a></p><a id="p1_53"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a><a id="p1_54">54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The motive of the offender</em>.

The online dissemination of CAM, especially in a medium where the CAM can be easily forwarded, would make it harder for the CAM to be eradicated. The use of the Dark Web, or VPN blockers, to distribute CAM also aggravates the offender’s culpability as these can be considered to be intentional steps taken by the offender to avoid detection.</a></p><a id="p1_56"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a><a id="p1_57">57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The degree of knowledge of the offender of the content of the CAM.</em> An offender who has greater awareness of the precise content of the CAM in question, and yet continues to distribute it, is more culpable than one who has “reason to believe” that the material he is distributing contains CAM, but is not fully aware of its entire or exact content.</a></p><a id="p1_57"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a><a id="p1_58">58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The role or position of the offender in the forum or platform where the CAM was distributed</em>.

On this scale, an offender has the highest culpability if he had intentionally sought out CAM with a view to distributing it.</a></p><a id="p1_60"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Calibrating the appropriate sentence on the present facts</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harm caused by the offence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a><a id="p1_61">61&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now analyse the offence-specific factors going towards harm on the present facts.

In my view, this point is essentially a mathematical description of the factual reality that the Accused had not intentionally sought out CAM for the purpose of distribution, which I have already taken into account as being culpability-reducing. The <em>mere fact</em> that the actual number of films containing CAM constitutes a very small percentage of all of the obscene films distributed by the Accused should not be treated as an <em>independent</em> culpability-reducing factor. In my view, an offender guilty of section 377BI of the Penal Code who happens to have also distributed a vast amount of other types of obscene materials to the detriment of society (and which also constitutes an offence) should <em>not</em> be deemed less culpable and punished less severely for the s 377BI PC offence compared to another offender who had <em>not</em> distributed other obscene materials or had distributed a smaller quantity of the same. If anything, the fact that the Accused had distributed other obscene materials in such large quantities should be considered an aggravating factor had a separate charge relating to these other obscene materials not been preferred. It does not and should not reduce his culpability for the s 377BI PC offence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72">72&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having considered and weighed all of these culpability-enhancing and culpability-reducing factors, I am of the view that that the Accused’s culpability should be pegged at the <em>higher end of low culpability</em>. The Accused’s culpability is low because he had not distributed CAM for profit, and there is no evidence of him actively seeking out CAM for distribution or discussing the content of CAM with any person. However, I assess his culpability to be at the <em>higher end</em> of low culpability because of his significant level of awareness that he was distributing CAM and the fact that he had distributed the CAM in his position as an administrator of the “Wela Group Chat”.</a></p><a id="p1_72"> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The indicative sentence and eventual sentence imposed</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a><a id="p1_73">73&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having assessed this case to be one under the higher end of moderate harm, and the higher end of low culpability, I am of the view that for an offence in which the maximum imprisonment sentence is 7 years, the indicative sentence based on the offence-specific factors to be imposed on the Accused should be <em>19 months’ imprisonment</em>. The sentence of 19 months’ imprisonment is above the one-fifth mark but below the one-quarter mark of the maximum sentence prescribed by Parliament. Given that the harm involved in this offence is bordering on severe harm, and the Accused’s culpability bordering on medium culpability, I am of the view that the indicative sentence I have derived (<em>ie</em>, 19 months’ imprisonment) is justified and cannot be considered excessive.</a></p><a id="p1_73"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a><a id="p1_74">74&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to consider whether there are any offender-specific aggravating or mitigating factors which should further calibrate the sentence upwards or downwards.</a></p><a id="p1_74"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a><a id="p1_75">75&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give no mitigating weight to the Defence’s submission that the investigations for this matter had “spanned one and a half years and has taken a huge toll” on the Accused as he has not been able to work or continue with his studies while on a student pass.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a> In my view, the personal hardship faced by the Accused from the point he was investigated is the natural consequence of his own wrongful actions and it is trite that such factors should ordinarily not be given mitigating weight (Kow Keng Siong, <em>Sentencing Principles in Singapore</em> (Academy Publishing, 2<sup>nd</sup> Ed, 2019) at pp 906 – 907). Furthermore, in the present case, the amount of time taken for investigations to be completed is in my view wholly reasonable given: (a) the sheer number of obscene materials found in the “Wela Group Chat”, (b) the time and resources the police had to expend to correctly trace a significant number of these obscene materials to the Accused (as the Accused had, prior to his arrest, “deleted the videos and accompanying messages from his WhatsApp”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>); and (c) the time and resources in which the Info-Communications Media Development Authority had to expend watching and classifying the obscene materials.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76">76&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the only relevant offender-specific factor the Court should give weight to is the Accused’s plea of guilt. However, I am of the view that the mitigatory value of the Accused’s plea of guilty is reduced, for the following reasons:</a></p><a id="p1_76"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76"></a><a id="p1_76-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Accused did not plead guilty at the earliest opportunity. In fact, he had decided to plead guilty to the s 377BI PC offence only after the criminal case disclosure conference (“CCDC”) process was completed and <em>after trial dates were fixed</em>. The Defence tried to explain that this was because the Accused’s phone had been seized by the police and he had no access to the relevant materials earlier. I do not find this a convincing reason as to why the Accused chose to plead guilty at such a late stage. The Accused had already admitted, during his interview by the police, that he had viewed some of the 17 films and knew that they contained CAM.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a> This constitutes the gravamen of the s 377BI PC offence. It also bears mention that the Accused had already “deleted the videos and the accompanying messages from his WhatsApp”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> at the point his phone was seized, so whether or not the Accused was in possession of his phone once investigations commenced should have little or no bearing on whether he should plead guilty to the s 377BI PC offence. In any case, under the CCDC regime, the Defence would already have had access to all relevant materials which the Prosecution is under an obligation to disclose before the 3<sup>rd</sup> CCDC hearing on 29 December 2022. Yet, the Accused continued to elect to claim trial which led to trial dates being fixed, and only decided to plead guilty on 3 February 2023, more than a month after the 3<sup>rd</sup> CCDC hearing. In the circumstances, I am of the view that the mitigatory value of the Accused’s plea of guilt should not be given as much weight as in a case where an offender had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, unlike in other types of sexual offences, the Accused’s decision to plead guilty for the s 377BI PC offence <em>cannot</em> be said to have the merit of sparing a sexual victim “the trauma of having to testify in court and relieve the humiliation she suffered as a result of the offence” (<em>GED</em> at [132]), which is generally given significant mitigating weight. This is because the child victims in the present case are not known to either the Prosecution or the Defence and they would not have been called as witnesses for the trial.</a></p><a id="p1_76-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_77">77&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, the only mitigatory value to be placed on the Accused’s decision to plead guilty is the fact that he had saved <em>some</em> of the Court’s time and <em>some</em> state resources which would have been expended had he proceeded to claim trial. Given the reduced mitigatory value of his plea of guilt, I am of the view that the indicative sentence for the s 377BI PC offence should be reduced by only 3 months. Therefore, the <em>eventual sentence</em> which I find just and appropriate for the s 377BI PC offence is <u>16 months’ imprisonment</u>.</a></p><a id="p1_77"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a><a id="p1_78">78&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the significant harm involved in the Accused’s offence, the considerable extent of the Accused’s culpability, and the reduced mitigatory value of his plea of guilt, the original sentences proposed by both the Prosecution (9 to 12 months’ imprisonment) and the Defence (8 months’ imprisonment) in their written submissions are, in my respectful view, clearly inadequate. The imposition of either an 8 months’ or 12 months’ imprisonment sentence in the present case will <em>not</em> do justice to the full sentencing range Parliament has prescribed for this serious offence, and will not be “proportionate to the severity of the [s 377BI PC offence] and the offender in question”.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Distinguishing Alvin Tay</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79">79&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For completeness, I will also address <em>Alvin Tay</em> even though the decision is of limited precedential value, given that parties have focused much attention on it.</a></p><a id="p1_79"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a><a id="p1_80">80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts in <em>Alvin Tay</em> are summarised as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_80"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80"></a><a id="p1_80-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between August to November 2020, the offender bought and sold sex videos by communicating with interested buyers via the messaging function on Tumblr, and accepting payment via PayLah before sending a Mega.NZ link containing obscene images or recordings.

I accept that this aggravating factor is not present here, but I am also of the view that this distinguishing factor is offset by the culpability-enhancing fact of the Accused having distributed the 17 films in his position as an administrator of the “Wela Group Chat”.</a></p><a id="p1_82-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_83">83&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also bears mention that the offender in <em>Alvin Tay</em> had elected to plead guilty at the earliest opportunity (in fact, at the very first court mention), while the Accused had done so only after the CCDC process was completed and trial dates fixed.</a></p><a id="p1_83"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a><a id="p1_84">84&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given all of the foregoing differences, it is in my view neither surprising nor unfair for the Accused to receive a sentence which is twice the length of that imposed in <em>Alvin Tay</em>. In any case, this Court’s reasoned decision as to how it had calibrated the sentence in the present case to be that of 16 months’ imprisonment has been set out in full above.</a></p><a id="p1_84"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The imposition of consecutive sentences</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a><a id="p1_85">85&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having determined the individual sentences to be imposed for both offences, I now turn to the issue of whether the sentences should be imposed consecutively (as submitted by the Prosecution) or concurrently (as submitted by the Defence).</a></p><a id="p1_85"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a><a id="p1_86">86&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence’s submission for the sentences to run concurrently is premised on the applicability of the one-transaction rule, which states that “where two or more offences are committed in the course of a single transaction, all sentences in respect of those offences should be concurrent rather than consecutive” (<em>Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 2 SLR(R) 0814.xml')">[2007] 2 SLR(R) 814</a> at [52]). In the present case, it is not disputed that both the Accused’s offences were committed via the same conduct and largely within the same time period, such that they are indeed proximate as a matter of fact. However, this does not conclusively determine whether the sentences should run concurrently. In <em>Mohamed Shouffee</em> (at [30] – [31]), the High Court clarified that:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[t]he better articulation of the rationale for the [one-transaction] rule is found in the principle that consecutive sentences are not appropriate if the various offences involve a “single invasion of the same legally protected interest”…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this formulation, the real basis of the one-transaction rule is unity of the violated interest that underlies the various offences. Where multiple offences are found to be proximate as a matter of fact but violate different legally protected interests, then they would not, at least as a general rule, be regarded as forming a single transaction.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87">87&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, to determine whether consecutive or concurrent sentences should be imposed in the present case, the Court has to first consider what are the legally protected interests underlying the s 292(1)(a) PC offence and the s 377BI PC offence.</a></p><a id="p1_87"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a><a id="p1_88">88&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 292(1)(a) of the Penal Code, the wrongful act in question is the transmission of “obscene” objects. The word “obscene” is defined under s 42 of the Penal Code as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_88"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The word “obscene”, in relation to any thing or matter, means any thing or matter the effect of which is, if taken as a whole, such as to <em>tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely</em>, having regard to all relevant circumstances, <em>to read, see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a><a id="p1_89">89&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading section 292(1)(a) together with section 42 of the Penal Code, I agree with the Prosecution that the relevant legally protected interest which is targeted by section 292(1)(a) of the Penal Code is the <em>maintenance of public morality or decency</em> in society. The purpose of section 292(1)(a) of the Penal Code is to prevent the transmission of materials which are prone to “<em>deprave and corrupt</em>” persons receiving such materials. The same legally protected interest is also targeted by equivalent provisions such as sections 29 to 32 of the Films Act, of which “primary concern in sentencing is the protection of the public from moral corruption” (<em>Sentencing Practice</em> at p 627).</a></p><a id="p1_89"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a><a id="p1_90">90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the relevant legally protected interest targeted by section 377BI of the Penal Code is the <em>protection of children from being sexually abused or exploited</em>. This is evident from the relevant extracts from the PCRC Report and the parliamentary speeches I have cited above (at [30] – [33]); in particular, the observation of the PCRC that provisions like section 292 of the Penal Code do <em>not</em> “have the objective of protecting children from abuse” (PCRC Report at p 131), thus necessitating the enactment of provisions such as section 377BI of the Penal Code. Put simply, Parliament did not enact section 377BI of the Penal Code to better protect recipients of materials containing CAM from moral corruption, however important or positive that outcome may be. Section 377BI of the Penal Code is fundamentally about the <em>protection of children</em>. When an offence under section 377BI of the Penal Code is committed, it is the dignity and bodily integrity of a child which is being violated, and the interest in preventing this particular form of violation is conceptually and morally distinct from the interest in upholding the moral character or decency of the general public.</a></p><a id="p1_90"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a><a id="p1_91">91&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I am of the view that the s 292(1)(a) PC offence and the s 377BI PC offence committed by the Accused target <em>different</em> legally protected interests, and the Accused’s commission of both offences in the present case should therefore <em>not</em> “be regarded as forming a single transaction” (<em>Mohamed Shouffee</em> at [31]). The one-transaction rule thus does not apply in the Accused’s favour. Having committed two offences and in the process violated two different legally protected interests, it is only just and appropriate for the sentences of both offences to run consecutively, resulting in an aggregate sentence of <u>18 months and 2 weeks’ imprisonment</u>.</a></p><a id="p1_91"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a><a id="p1_92">92&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, even if the s 292(1)(a) PC offence and the s 377BI PC offence should be viewed or understood as forming part of a single transaction, I am of the view that the imposition of consecutive sentences in the present case remains nonetheless justified in order to “give sufficient weight to the interest of deterrence so as to discourage behaviour of the sort” exhibited by the Accused (<em>Mohamed Shouffee</em> at [45(a)]), which consists in him misusing his role as an administrator of a popular WhatsApp chat group to distribute, and encourage the exchange of, child abuse and other obscene materials. In this day and age where child abuse and other obscene materials can spread so quickly and easily through such messaging platforms, the imposition of consecutive sentences is necessary to send a clear signal that users of such platforms will be held accountable for <em>all</em> of the illegal materials they are charged and convicted for unlawfully distributing. The imposition of consecutive sentences in the present case is also “in keeping with the gravity of the offences” (<em>Mohamed Shouffee</em> at [45(b)]). Having been charged and convicted for unlawfully distributing a total of 960 films, the true gravity of the Accused’s offences will not, in my view, be accurately reflected if he were to be effectively punished just for his distribution of 17 of these 960 films, notwithstanding the fact that the punishment for the s 377BI PC offence is much more severe than the punishment for the s 292(1)(a) PC offence.</a></p><a id="p1_92"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a><a id="p1_93">93&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I also consider the principle of totality and am of the view that the imposition of consecutive sentences in the present case cannot be said to be crushing or disproportionate, considering the Accused’s age and the fact that the aggregate sentence imposed (<em>ie</em>, 18 months and 2 weeks’ imprisonment) is in fact lower than the indicative sentence I have earlier derived for the s 377BI PC offence (<em>ie</em>, 19 months’ imprisonment).</a></p><a id="p1_93"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a><a id="p1_94">94&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the concluding paragraphs of its written submissions, the Prosecution put forth the following, impassioned plea for justice:</a></p><a id="p1_94"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">26.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every single instance of sexual activity that is present in these clips is an instance of a child being sexually abused. It is hard to overstate what the Court is really looking at. Each clip is a child in the midst of being groped, raped, and violated. Some of these might be children being trafficked into sex, others being raped by family members, sometimes both.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">27.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any recording of child sexual abuse is a reminder of a living nightmare. Each time a clip is distributed, a fresh trauma and harm is being done again to <em>that</em> child as paedophiles savour the horrific abuse that has happened (and might well still be happening) to these children. Each distribution further ensures that the worst moments of their lives will percolate through the internet, making it more and more difficult to erase. It is also a living nightmare because the acts of distribution, possession, and consumption create the vicious cycle of demand that allows for horrific acts to occur to <em>new children</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">28.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused’s actions feed into that very cycle of evil. At a time where such child sexual abuse continues to grow unabated, we urge the Courts to do all it can to combat such evils. No child should ever have to suffer the sort of abuse seen in these clips. We owe it to them to stop it however we can.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a><a id="p1_95">95&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sorrowful indignation – at the depravity of those who produced, distributed or consumed the materials in question; but even more, at the plight of each and every precious child so inhumanely abused and violated in them – I agree. In the face of this monstrous evil, the Court has a duty to impose a sentence which sufficiently reflects society’s justified abhorrence of acts which encourage or facilitate the sexual abuse of children; and one that is properly situated within the full sentencing range prescribed by Parliament given the circumstances of the offence and the offender in question.</a></p><a id="p1_95"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a><a id="p1_96">96&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all the foregoing reasons, I have come to the view that the sentences originally proposed by both the Prosecution and the Defence in their written submissions are inadequate, and that the just and appropriate aggregate sentence the Accused deserves for his offences is 18 months and 2 weeks’ imprisonment. It should now be clear that with section 377BI of the Penal Code in force, those who choose to be complicit in the sexual abuse of children by knowingly distributing CAM will be severely dealt with. The harm which they so callously inflict and prolong on an abused, suffering child shall reap for these offenders the full weight of justice which the Court will, in accordance with law, unflinchingly mete out.</a></p><a id="p1_96"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a><a id="p1_97">97&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It remains for me in closing to express my gratitude to the Prosecution and the Defence for their detailed and helpful submissions.</a></p><a id="p1_97"> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"></a><p class="Footnote"><a id="p1_97"><sup></sup></a><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a>Prosecution’s Written Submissions (“PWS”) at [2].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>PWS at [21].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>PWS at [23].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>PWS at [24].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_5_1" id="Ftn_5">[note: 5]</a></sup>Defence’s Mitigation Plea (“DMP”) at [24(a)(iii)].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_6_1" id="Ftn_6">[note: 6]</a></sup>DMP at [36(a)].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_7_1" id="Ftn_7">[note: 7]</a></sup>DMP at [36(b)].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_8_1" id="Ftn_8">[note: 8]</a></sup>The statement of facts (“SOF”) at [24].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_9_1" id="Ftn_9">[note: 9]</a></sup>SOF at [5].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_10_1" id="Ftn_10">[note: 10]</a></sup>SOF at [8].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_11_1" id="Ftn_11">[note: 11]</a></sup>PWS at [27].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_12_1" id="Ftn_12">[note: 12]</a></sup>Annex C of the SOF (s/n 1, 9, 10 and 13).</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_13_1" id="Ftn_13">[note: 13]</a></sup>Annex C of the SOF (s/n 5, 12 and 14).</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_14_1" id="Ftn_14">[note: 14]</a></sup>Annex C of the SOF (s/n 7).</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_15_1" id="Ftn_15">[note: 15]</a></sup>Annex C of the SOF (s/n 3).</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_16_1" id="Ftn_16">[note: 16]</a></sup>Annex C of the SOF (s/n 6).</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_17_1" id="Ftn_17">[note: 17]</a></sup>Annex C of the SOF (s/n 8).</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_18_1" id="Ftn_18">[note: 18]</a></sup>Annex C of the SOF (s/n 4 and 16).</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_19_1" id="Ftn_19">[note: 19]</a></sup>Annex C of the SOF (s/n 1 and 4).</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_20_1" id="Ftn_20">[note: 20]</a></sup>Annex C of the SOF (s/n 16).</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_21_1" id="Ftn_21">[note: 21]</a></sup>Annex C of the SOF (s/n 6 and 17).</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_22_1" id="Ftn_22">[note: 22]</a></sup>SOF at [15].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_23_1" id="Ftn_23">[note: 23]</a></sup>DMP at [23(a)].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_24_1" id="Ftn_24">[note: 24]</a></sup>PWS at [23(a)].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_25_1" id="Ftn_25">[note: 25]</a></sup>SOF at [27].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_26_1" id="Ftn_26">[note: 26]</a></sup>SOF at [28].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_27_1" id="Ftn_27">[note: 27]</a></sup>SOF at [17] – [18].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_28_1" id="Ftn_28">[note: 28]</a></sup>SOF at [20] – [21].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_29_1" id="Ftn_29">[note: 29]</a></sup>DMP at [24(c)].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_30_1" id="Ftn_30">[note: 30]</a></sup>PWS at [23(d)(i)].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_31_1" id="Ftn_31">[note: 31]</a></sup>DMP at [23(d)].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_32_1" id="Ftn_32">[note: 32]</a></sup>DMP at [24(b)].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_33_1" id="Ftn_33">[note: 33]</a></sup>DMP at [24(a)].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_34_1" id="Ftn_34">[note: 34]</a></sup>DMP at [29].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_35_1" id="Ftn_35">[note: 35]</a></sup>SOF at [8].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_36_1" id="Ftn_36">[note: 36]</a></sup>SOF at [28].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_37_1" id="Ftn_37">[note: 37]</a></sup>SOF at [8].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_38_1" id="Ftn_38">[note: 38]</a></sup>DMP at [32].</p></div></content></html>
