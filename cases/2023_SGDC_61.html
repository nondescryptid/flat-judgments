They ordered one bottle of Chivas whiskey (“the glass bottle”) to share. While they were drinking, Amirul showed Dani he had a black foldable knife with him. At about 10.30pm, the group of four left the bar. The Accused held onto the glass bottle and consumed the remaining whiskey while they walked around. The group walked around and ended up near Riverside Point, along Merchant Road. They were intoxicated. As they wanted to look for a convenience store to buy cigarettes, Dani and the said Ryzka approached the security officer for directions.

The Accused used the glass bottle to hit the victim’s head a few times, before dropping it on the floor, causing it to smash. A patch of the victim’s hair fell off. The victim fell onto the ground. The Accused and Amirul punched the victim. Dani heard the commotion and ran towards them to join in. Amirul and Dani punched and kicked the victim.

From [77] of <em>Al- Ansari</em>:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <em>“First, the court must ask itself whether rehabilitation can remain a predominant consideration. If the offence was particularly heinous or the offender has a long history of offending, then reform and rehabilitation may not even be possible or relevant, notwithstanding the youth of the offender. In this case, the statutorily prescribed punishment (in most cases a term of imprisonment) will be appropriate.</em> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <em>However, if the principle of rehabilitation is considered to be relevant as a dominant consideration, the next question is how to give effect to this….”</em> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <em>Al-Ansari</em> framework was elaborated upon in <em>Public Prosecutor v Koh Wen Jie Boaz (“Boaz”)</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18361-SSP.xml')">[2016] 1 SLR 334</a> and affirmed by the Court of Appeal in <em>Public Prosecutor v ASR</em> [2019] SLR 941.

The inquiry proceeds from the foremost question of whether rehabilitation remains the dominant sentencing principle,&nbsp;before&nbsp;considering whether probation or reformative training or some other type or combination of community-based sentences would be the correct way to achieve this. At the first stage, the court should not be asking whether the offender showed enough rehabilitative potential for&nbsp;probation, as opposed to&nbsp;reformative training. Rather, at that stage of the inquiry, the question is whether in all the circumstances, the&nbsp;presumptive emphasis&nbsp;on rehabilitation has been displaced. If it has, then rehabilitative options such as probation or reformative training would typically not be available; and if it has not been displaced, then such options may be considered.”&nbsp;</em> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, in determining the appropriate sentence for the Accused, the first and key question for the Court was whether rehabilitation remained the dominant sentencing consideration in this case.

However, instead of abiding by the conditions of the supervision order and remaining in contact with his Reintegration Officer, the Accused removed his electronic tag so that his location could not be tracked. He became uncontactable from 23 March 2022 and failed to report as required<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Overall Assessment</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should make it clear that the fact that the Accused had undergone a stint of reformative training before was not a factor which militated against the imposition on another term of reformative training. There was nothing to bar the court from ordering a second term of reformative training in respect of the Accused, if rehabilitation remained the key sentencing objective.</a></p><a id="p1_35"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on the reasons elaborated above, I found that deterrence had come to the fore as the dominant sentencing consideration in this case. The fact that the Accused had been through the regime of reformative training where help and intervention in the rehabilitation process were rendered over 12 months or more, but with seemingly little success in the Accused’s reform, merely served to satisfy this court that a greater measure of deterrence was necessary for this young person.</a></p><a id="p1_36"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused's capacity for rehabilitation was not so demonstrably high that it would not be overshadowed by the need for deterrence. On the evidence before me, there was nothing exceptional about the surrounding circumstances of this case, the degree of remorse shown by the Accused or the level of familial support that would be available to the Accused, so as to justify maintaining an overriding focus on the Accused’s rehabilitation despite the circumstances of the case. Reformative training, which primarily has its focus on rehabilitation, was therefore not a viable sentencing option for the Court.</a></p><a id="p1_37"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Appropriate Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">DAC 905065/2022 – Voluntarily Causing Hurt</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offence carried an imprisonment term which may extend to three years, or fine, or both. Prosecution submitted for a sentence of eight months’ imprisonment, in parity with the sentence of the co-accused, Dani (even though Dani’s role in the offence was less egregious). In my mind, that was a fair sentence, bearing in mind the age of the Accused at the time of the offence. I imposed the same.</a></p><a id="p1_38"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">DAC 910632/22 – Consumption of Methamphetamine</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum punishment prescribed for this offence was five years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane.
