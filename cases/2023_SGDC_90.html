The co-accused had already checked in to the room that the accused had booked and brought the victim to the said room.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>The accused arrived at the said room subsequently after he finished work and bought bubble tea for the three of them</b>. When he arrived, he saw that the victim and the co-accused were already naked and on one of the beds in the room and went to shower.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>After his shower, the accused joined the duo on the bed and started kissing the victim on her neck and breasts, touching her thighs and fondling her breasts.</b> At the same time, the co-accused was also touching the victim on her breasts and thighs. <b>The victim also masturbated the accused by stroking his penis with her hand</b>, at the co-accused’s instructions. <b>However, the accused was unable to achieve an erection because he was stressed and felt guilty that the victim was so young.</b> The co-accused tried to help the accused to achieve an erection by stroking the accused’s penis with his hand, with the victim seated between the accused and co-accused and facing the accused. However, the accused could not achieve an erection and was disappointed.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>The accused then watched the co-accused and the victim have sexual intercourse from a separate bed in the room, and at times would walk over to them and touch the victim’s breasts while the duo were engaged in sexual intercourse.

I took the view that a sentence of 7 months and 2 weeks imprisonment will be an appropriate sentence. My reasons are as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_3"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3"></a><a id="p1_3-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>PP v AQW </em></a><em><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17724-SSP.xml')">[2015] 4 SLR 150</a> (“AQW”)</em> where the offender had pleaded guilty in the District Court to three proceeded charges, all of which arose out of sexual activity that he had engaged in with a male minor (“the minor”) over the course of one night. At the time of the offences, he was 35 years old and the minor was just under 15 years old. They became acquainted when the offender used a Facebook account that he operated under a pseudonym to contact the minor. The offender introduced himself using another assumed name and told the minor that he was a 19-year-old living alone at home, and the minor in turn told the offender that he was 14 years old. They eventually met in person. Following an afternoon meal, they returned to the offender’s flat and the minor was left alone there while the offender ran some errands. They then went to a restaurant for dinner with a friend of the offender. Thereafter, the offender and the minor returned to the flat, where the minor watched television while the offender packed for an overseas trip he was to make the following day. At midnight, the offender and the minor proceeded to bed, and there they engaged in sexual activity which involved the offender masturbating the minor and performing fellatio on him. They fell asleep after this. When they woke the following morning, they engaged in further sexual activity which involved the offender masturbating the minor. Thereafter, the minor went back to sleep and the offender left for the airport. The minor left the flat later that day and deposited the house keys in the letterbox. The offender and the minor had no further contact after that night.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menon CJ who heard the appeal in <em>AQW</em> reduced the global sentence from 16 months to 12 months’ imprisonment for the offender and also:</a></p><a id="p1_3-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_3-p2_b-p3_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;held [at 50)] that a sentence of between 6 and 8 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate where (1) the sexual act that took place between the offender and the minor involved touching of naked genitalia, regardless of whose genitalia it was, (2) the minor is 14 years old or above, and does not appear to be particularly vulnerable, (3) the offender did not coerce or pressure the minor into participating in the sexual act, and (4) there was no element of abuse of trust; and</a></p><a id="p1_3-p2_b-p3_i"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_3-p2_b-p3_i"></a><a id="p1_3-p2_b-p3_ii">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set out (at [19] to [27]) the following sentencing considerations for the application of the aforesaid sentencing benchmark for a s7 CYPA offence:</a></p><a id="p1_3-p2_b-p3_ii"> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">“19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from the minor’s vulnerability, the other key consideration in sentencing for sexual offences against minors is the degree of exploitation to which the offender has subjected the minor. This refers to the extent to which the offender has interfered with and violated the minor’s rights. One facet of this is the nature of the sexual contact between the offender and the minor….Penetrative sexual activity is regarded as the most serious because it represents the greatest intrusion into the bodily integrity and privacy of the minor, and involves the highest potential for physical, psychological and emotional damage to the minor. Hence the perpetration of such activity on a minor represents the greatest degree of exploitation as compared to other forms of sexual activity and accordingly, merits greater sanction.</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further distinction may be drawn within the class of non-penetrative sexual activity. In the UK Sentencing Council guidelines on the offences under ss&nbsp;9 and 10 of the UK Act, Category 1 Harm is constituted by penetrative sexual activity, Category&nbsp;2 by non-penetrative sexual activity consisting of touching or exposure of naked genitalia or naked breasts, and Category&nbsp;3 by all other non-penetrative sexual activity. <b>It is not difficult to see that there is greater invasion of bodily integrity and privacy, and hence a greater degree of exploitation, when genitalia and breasts are involved, which warrants a harsher sentence….</b></p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extent of an offender’s exploitation of a minor also depends on many other factors that I shall not endeavour to list exhaustively. In this connection, it is helpful to refer to the UK Sentencing Council guidelines because they identify a substantial number of factors that courts should pay heed to. For instance, in the guidelines on the various sexual offences against children under 13, most, if not all, of the factors that elevate a case beyond Category&nbsp;3 Harm to Categories&nbsp;2 or 1 relate to the degree of exploitation of the minor, including: (a)&nbsp;violence or threats of violence, (b)&nbsp;penetration using large or dangerous objects, (c)&nbsp;abduction and/or prolonged detention, (d)&nbsp;forced entry into the minor’s home, and (e)&nbsp;any additional degradation or humiliation. Other examples of increased exploitation occur when the offender records, retains and/or shares sexual images and/or uses those images to blackmail the minor, or abuses trust placed in him by the minor. Factors such as cruelty, sex slavery or sadomasochistic practices would also constitute aggravated exploitation of the minor.</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have touched on the relevance of the minor’s age (see [16] above). The Prosecution in this case placed much reliance on the age of the accused. There were two specific aspects of this which were raised by the Prosecution and which, in particular, I consider – the relevance of the age disparity between offender and minor as well as the fact that the offender lied to the minor about his age. The Prosecution argued that these factors called for a higher sentence to be imposed on the appellant. Indeed, I note that in the UK Sentencing Council guidelines on the offences defined by ss&nbsp;9 and 10 of the UK Act, two of the factors said to elevate a case beyond “B” Culpability to “A” Culpability are a significant disparity in age and the fact that the offender lied about his age.</p> </a><p class="Judg-QuoteList-3"><a id="p1_3-p2_b-p3_ii">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the age disparity is concerned, I find myself in complete agreement with the remarks of Chao Hick Tin&nbsp;JA in the recent case of&nbsp;<em>PP&nbsp;v Qiu Shuihua</em>&nbsp;</a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17553-SSP.xml')">[2015] 3 SLR 949</a>&nbsp;at [19]–[24]. The main points that emerge from that decision are these: (a)&nbsp;the age of the offender is relevant so far as it goes towards the prospects of the offender’s rehabilitation; (b)&nbsp;the absolute age of the offender, as well as the age disparity between offender and minor, may be relevant but would not be decisive and determinative; (c)&nbsp;so far as a greater age disparity tends to cause more pronounced public outrage, it would be wrong for the court to give effect to such outrage by handing down a harsher sentence because public perceptions may be premised on “irrational social stereotypes” and “an incomplete understanding of the facts”; and (d)&nbsp;<b>far more important than matters of age would be the “way the offence was committed” and “the circumstances leading to the offence</b>”.</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my judgment, <b>an undue focus on age may distract the court from the key considerations of the minor’s vulnerability and the degree of exploitation of the minor.</b> Undoubtedly, the&nbsp;<em>minor’s</em>&nbsp;age generally goes towards his or her vulnerability, but I do not think that the&nbsp;<em>age disparity</em>, without more, necessarily says very much about the extent to which the offender has exploited the minor. Assuming a 14-year-old minor, and comparing the case of a 23-year-old offender who forcibly subdues the minor in the course of committing a sexual offence with the case of a 45-year-old who carries out an identical sexual act in circumstances wholly devoid of any coercion or pressure, it seems obvious to me that the former case is deserving of harsher punishment notwithstanding the far smaller age disparity. <b>Therefore, the age disparity, without more, ought ordinarily to be given little, if any, weight in sentencing.</b> I have said “ordinarily” because it is conceivable for instance that the <b>age disparity reveals something about the offender such as his motivations or his prospects for rehabilitation or his enhanced ability to influence the minor that may have a bearing on sentencing.</b></p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn to the fact of an offender’s lying about his age. While this may be relevant to sentencing because it tends to suggest a more significant degree of exploitation of the minor, it is extremely important that this not be viewed in isolation but rather that it be seen in the light of all the circumstances of the case. For instance, if an offender has lied about his age but has not otherwise attempted to conceal his identity or his whereabouts, and there is no evidence that the minor set much store by the offender’s age, the&nbsp;<em>totality</em>&nbsp;of the circumstances would suggest a fairly low degree of exploitation. Against that background, the offender’s untruth fades into relative insignificance. Hence, I would prefer to see these factors as markers that may warrant closer consideration but the court must then assess their real significance in all the circumstances.</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reiterate that <b>the two key considerations in sentencing for sexual offences against minors are, first, the vulnerability of the minor, and second, the degree of exploitation to which the offender has subjected the minor</b>. Certain factors will, by themselves, indicate a high level of vulnerability or exploitation – for instance, the minor’s extreme youth, or violence inflicted on the minor in subduing him or her – and accordingly warrant a steep increase in the sentence to be imposed. On the other hand, there are factors which, viewed in isolation, may tend to suggest higher levels of exploitation, but when seen together with all the circumstances of the case might turn out to be of peripheral importance<b>.</b> I consider that the age disparity between offender and minor and the fact of an offender’s lying about his age are examples of such factors, and the proper approach is not to focus minutely and mechanistically on them but to attend to the overall picture that emerges from the entirety of the facts.</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows from all I have said that <b>the highest end of the sentencing scale is reserved for cases in which the minor is particularly vulnerable and where the offender has exploited the minor to a significant degree by subjecting him or her to penetrative sexual activity in circumstances involving a great deal of coercion that might include violence. As against this, courts should be careful not to impose excessive punishments on offenders in situations where the minor is not particularly vulnerable</b>, as where he or she is not far off from 16&nbsp;years of age <b>and manifests no physical, psychological, intellectual or other sub-normality, and where the offender has subjected the minor to no coercion, intimidation, blackmail or any pressure of that sort and there has not been any kind of abuse of trust…</b>..” (emphasis in bold added)</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both parties agreed on the above sentencing benchmark for a s7 CYPA offence as laid down in <em>AQW</em> for application to the present case. It has been judicially affirmed that s 7 of the CYPA reflects a protective philosophy. In <em>AQW (at [13])</em>, Menon CJ explained that both s 376A of the Penal Code and s 7 of the CYPA had “the common objective of protecting a class of vulnerable people, namely minors under the age of 16, from sexual exploitation”. For completeness, it bears mentioning that this principle is still reflected even in the current enactment of the CYPA.</a></p><a id="p1_3-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_3-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In applying the above sentencing considerations to the present case, I accepted the following defence submissions:</a></p><a id="p1_3-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_3-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_3-p2_d-p3_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the nature of sexual contact, the AP did not perform or attempt to perform any penetrative or invasive action at all on the victim's vagina, anus, or mouth. The full extent of his sexual contract with her was limited to her using her hands to stroke the AP's genitals and the AP kissing her neck, breast and touching her inner thigh. This was also done without the use of force or coercion.</a></p><a id="p1_3-p2_d-p3_i"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_3-p2_d-p3_i"></a><a id="p1_3-p2_d-p3_ii">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the manner of exploitation, the AP had not abused the trust of the victim in any capacity. The victim had advertised her services online on a website, was fully cognisant and acutely aware of her decision to make money through offering her sexual services in order to purchase gaming credits and the consequences of her actions. The victim had also done the obscene act with the AP without any form of force or coercion. The AP did not perform any degrading, humiliating, or cruel acts on the victim and had acted with sensitivity and care towards her emotional and physical well-being at all times. The AP even made sure the victim got home safely and waited with her whilst her Grab car was on its way. This was a purely commercial transaction with no degree of emotional or mental exploitation of the victim's trust. The victim's age must be considered in the context that she has shown herself capable of advertising her services on the website Locanto, her age, being one year younger than the victim in <em>AQW</em>, is one such factor that should not be viewed in isolation.</a></p><a id="p1_3-p2_d-p3_ii"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_3-p2_d-p3_ii"></a><a id="p1_3-p2_d-p3_iii">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP was not sexually grooming the victim because under section 376E of the Penal Code ("S 376"), "sexual grooming" occurs when an offender meets an individual who is under the age of 16 years old with the intention of having sexual intercourse or any other form of sexual activity with the individual where the offender had previously met or communicated with the individual on at least one previous occasion. Furthermore, s 376 also prescribes that the offender must not reasonably believe that the individual is of or above the age of 16 years old. Based on the facts, it is clear that the AP and the victim had no prior meeting and had only met on the day of the incident. There was no prior attempt to accost or talk to victim, meet with her, seduce her or in any way entice her with the prospect of having sex as the co-accused had handled all the arrangements and was the only person who liaised directly with her.</a></p><a id="p1_3-p2_d-p3_iii"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_3-p2_d-p3_iii"></a><a id="p1_3-p2_d-p3_iv">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the AP tried continuously to attain an erection so that he could engage in sexual activity with the victim so as to have some form of intimacy with the victim and did so for which he is charged, what is clear is that he did not attempt any form of penetration during the course of the encounter.</a></p><a id="p1_3-p2_d-p3_iv"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_d-p3_iv"></a><a id="p1_3-p2_e">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the way the present offence was committed and the circumstances leading to the offence, as highlighted by the prosecution, revealed several aggravating factors as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_3-p2_e"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_3-p2_e"></a><a id="p1_3-p2_e-p3_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victim was 13 years old at the time. While the AP asserted that he did not know the exact age of the victim, he clearly knew that she was underaged as informed by the co-accused prior to their meeting with the victim. When he met the victim, he perceived her to be young, about 14 or 15 years old.</a></p><a id="p1_3-p2_e-p3_i"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_3-p2_e-p3_i"></a><a id="p1_3-p2_e-p3_ii">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there was no continued communication between the AP and the victim, the AP was involved in the arrangements to have a threesome with the victim. This introduced the victim, a minor, to a sexual activity that she was unfamiliar and uncomfortable with and which a 13-year-old ordinarily would not be exposed to. The AP himself had observed the victim to be very awkward and uncomfortable throughout the session.</a></p><a id="p1_3-p2_e-p3_ii"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_3-p2_e-p3_ii"></a><a id="p1_3-p2_e-p3_iii">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there was no penetrative activity by the AP, he did demonstrate persistent engagement in his sexual acts with the victim. The entire session lasted about 2 hours. During this time, the victim masturbated the AP. The AP then masturbated himself while watching the co-accused and victim engage in sexual intercourse, with a view to sustaining an erection for the purpose of a threesome with the minor. This raised the AP’s level of culpability.</a></p><a id="p1_3-p2_e-p3_iii"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_3-p2_e-p3_iii"></a><a id="p1_3-p2_e-p3_iv">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victim had used her hands to stroke the AP's genitals while the AP had kissed the victim on her neck, breast and touched her inner thigh. All these involved a greater degree of exploitation since genitalia and breasts are involved, as pointed out in <em>AQW</em>.</a></p><a id="p1_3-p2_e-p3_iv"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_e-p3_iv"></a><a id="p1_3-p2_f">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the AP’s role and culpability based on the statement of facts, he had booked the chalet room at the request of the co-accused, and both agreed to split the cost of the victim’s engagement (i.e. $300) and that each of them would pay the victim $150 and that there would be no kissing, no oral sex and that the sexual intercourse would be with the use of protection. After his shower, the AP had joined the duo on the bed who were at the chalet before him and started kissing the victim on her neck and breasts, touching her thighs and fondling her breasts. The victim also masturbated the AP by stroking his penis with her hand, at the co-accused’s instructions. However, the AP was unable to achieve an erection because he was stressed and felt guilty that the victim was so young. The AP then watched the co-accused and the victim have sexual intercourse from a separate bed in the room, and at times would walk over to them and touch the victim’s breasts while the duo were engaged in sexual intercourse. While watching the co-accused and the victim engage in sexual intercourse, the AP masturbated himself.

In total, the AP observed that the co-accused and the victim engaged in at least three to four rounds of sexual intercourse in various positions. The AP noted that the victim appeared inexperienced as she was not very participative during the entire session and was very awkward and uncomfortable. After the co-accused and the victim finished, the three of them consumed the bubble tea, chatted and left Downtown East. The entire session lasted about two hours. All these showed the AP’s persistent engagement in sexual acts with the victim even though the AP had observed that the victim looked very young, possibly 14 or 15 years old. There is also an element of corruption of the victim, a minor, given that the AP and co-accused had planned and agreed to engage in a threesome with the victim.</a></p><a id="p1_3-p2_f"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_f"></a><a id="p1_3-p2_g">(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only applicable mitigating factor in this case is the AP’s lack of antecedents. The AP’s plea of guilt should be given little weight given that there was an eyewitness present (the co-accused).</a></p><a id="p1_3-p2_g"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_g"></a><a id="p1_3-p2_h">(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accepted the prosecution submissions that:</a></p><a id="p1_3-p2_h"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_3-p2_h"></a><a id="p1_3-p2_h-p3_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offender in <em>AQW</em> faced both CYPA and Penal Code offences, and reliance should only be placed on the High Court’s decision in relation to the CYPA sentences. In that case, the offender’s act of performing fellatio on the minor gave rise to one charge for the offence of sexual penetration of a minor under s 376A(1)(c) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), while his acts of masturbating the minor gave rise to two charges for the offence of sexual exploitation of a young person under s 7(a) of the CYPA. For the CYPA offences, he was ultimately sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment for each offence. For the Penal Code offence, which was the offence involving penetration, the offender was sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment ultimately. Thus, it would be inaccurate to say that the sentence imposed for the CYPA offences in <em>AQW</em> took into account the offender’s culpability for penetrative sexual activity and the key comparator should remain only the section 7 CYPA offence.</a></p><a id="p1_3-p2_h-p3_i"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_3-p2_h-p3_i"></a><a id="p1_3-p2_h-p3_ii">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence suggestion that a higher sentence may have been imposed on the offender in <em>AQW</em> because he was a Junior College teacher is not evinced in the High Court’s reasoning in <em>AQW</em> and there was no discussion of the offender’s occupation when deriving the ultimate sentence imposed.</a></p><a id="p1_3-p2_h-p3_ii"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_3-p2_h-p3_ii"></a><a id="p1_3-p2_h-p3_iii">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence attempted characterisation of the victim as one who was experienced in having commercial sex, and that the AP was not her first customer should not be accepted as it flies in the face of the AP’s own observations of the victim during their encounter and, in any case, persons below 16 years of age generally lack experience and maturity in matters pertaining to their own sexuality. By the AP’s own admission, the victim appeared inexperienced as she was not very participative during the entire session and was very awkward and uncomfortable. This could hardly point towards a sexually experienced, savvy individual. There is also no evidence to show that the AP was not the victim’s first “customer” or how the parameters of the sexual encounter were discussed between parties.</a></p><a id="p1_3-p2_h-p3_iii"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_h-p3_iii"></a><a id="p1_3-p2_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agreed with the prosecution that a sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment as suggested by the defence placed the present case at the lower end of the benchmark sentence of between 6 and 8 months’ imprisonment, which is not appropriate in light of the above aggravating factors. I took the view that the aggravating factors as well as the AP’s role and culpability placed the present case close to but not at the highest end of the benchmark sentence and I imposed a sentence of 7 months and 2 weeks’ imprisonment on the AP for the charge in DAC-904110-2022.</a></p><a id="p1_3-p2_i"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_i"></a><a id="p1_3-p2_j">(j)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the highest end of the sentencing scale of 8 months is not appropriate for the present case as Menon CJ in <em>AQW</em> had made it clear that it should be reserved for cases in which the minor is particularly vulnerable and where the offender has exploited the minor to a significant degree by subjecting her to penetrative sexual activity in circumstances involving a great deal of coercion that might include violence, and as cautioned by Menon CJ in <em>AQW</em>, courts should be careful not to impose excessive punishments on offenders in situations where the minor is not particularly vulnerable and manifests no physical, psychological, intellectual or other sub-normality, and where the offender has subjected the minor to no coercion, intimidation, blackmail or any pressure of that sort and there has not been any kind of abuse of trust. Further, the age disparity in the present case did not reveal anything about the AP such as his motivations or his prospects for rehabilitation, or his enhanced ability to influence the minor that may have a bearing on sentencing. Therefore, the age disparity, without more, ought ordinarily be given little, if any, weight in sentencing in the present case as far more important than matters of age, as pointed out by Menon CJ in <em>AQW</em>, would be the “way the offence was committed” and “the circumstances leading to the offence” as shown in the aggravating factors and the AP’s role and culpability as highlighted above.</a></p><a id="p1_3-p2_j"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_j"></a><a id="p1_3-p2_k">(k)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all the above reasons, I imposed on the AP a sentence of 7 months and 2 weeks’ imprisonment for the charge in DAC-904110-2022.</a></p><a id="p1_3-p2_k"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">(D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONCLUSION</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3-p2_k"></a><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the aforesaid sentence of 7 months and 2 weeks imprisonment which I have imposed on the AP was not manifestly excessive or inadequate, but entirely appropriate and consistent with the principles of proportionality and totality without the effect of a crushing sentence on the AP.</a></p><a id="p1_4"> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"></a><p class="Footnote"><a id="p1_4"><sup></sup></a><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a>Section 7(a) of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38, 2001 Rev Ed) states as follows:“Any person who, in public or private commits or abets the commission of or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any person of any obscene or indecent act with any child or young person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine not exceeding $20,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or to both.</p></div></content></html>
