An example was the approximate high financial margins for the animals seized from the Accused as tabulated by the Prosecution:</a></p><a id="p1_32"> <p align=""><img alt="" class="contentimg" longdesc="" src="data:image;base64," style="max-width: 100%;height: auto;height:250.251479166667pt;width:355.002472222222pt;"></p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the financial incentives across the spectrum of the illicit pet trade chain, the Prosecution pointed out that this would explain the prevalence of online platforms offering such illegally imported animals for sale as well as the rapidly increasing cases of illegal importation of such animals.</a></p><a id="p1_33"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impact on legitimate pet businesses</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution submitted that another impact of the Accused’s actions is that it significantly undermines the legitimate pet businesses in Singapore. This is in view of the substantial compliance and cost differences in the absence of any need to maintain regulatory and welfare standards by the illegal pet smuggling operators. If left unchecked, the ready availability of unlicenced pets for sale will create an unfair disadvantage on honest and compliant local pet business operators in Singapore which may necessarily drive them out from the pet trade altogether.</a></p><a id="p1_34"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Difficulty of detection</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution highlighted that such illegal importation activities are difficult to detect. In the Accused’s case, the Accused admitted that he started bringing live pet animals into Singapore in 2021. He would do so on average about two to three times a month with seven or more animals. He was undetected until he was caught on 18 October 2022.</a></p><a id="p1_35"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High degree of premeditation </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the facts, the Prosecution submitted that there was a high degree of premeditation involved in planning such animal smuggling operations. They are well thought-out with sufficient precautions in place to prevent the identification of the Malaysian suppliers as well as the Singapore buyers or contacts. When arrangements were made for the collection of the illegal pets at pre-arranged collection locations in Singapore, there was an insulating layer between Dido or Komo and the buyers or contacts via the courier to ensure anonymity until the latter came to pick up the animals.</a></p><a id="p1_36"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">G.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transboundary smuggling syndicate</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution submitted that the Accused was part of a transboundary syndicate involved in the smuggling of unlicensed pet animals into Singapore because:</a></p><a id="p1_37"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37"></a><a id="p1_37-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he committed the offences in connivance with at least 2 others in Malaysia, Dido and Komo. In addition, the local contacts or buyers might have further assisted in the sub-distribution of the animals once in Singapore;</a></p><a id="p1_37-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_37-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this was not the first time he had imported pet animals into Singapore. It was not a one-off transaction.;</a></p><a id="p1_37-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_37-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there was a structured remuneration system for payment of the Accused for each occasion; and</a></p><a id="p1_37-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_37-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there was a structured sale, collection and delivery system for the transportation of the animals from Malaysia into Singapore.</a></p><a id="p1_37-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the Prosecution was of the view that there is a need for deterrence to discourage like-minded foreigners from attempting to perpetuate such illicit smuggling offences. Even though the Accused was only a courier or an intermediary, he was nevertheless an integral component of such cross-border businesses to operate.</a></p><a id="p1_38"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Relevant sentencing precedents</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution tendered a table of sentencing precedents of 30 cases. The table is annexed herein as “Annex A”. The Prosecution submitted that they were seeking for sentences much higher than the usual tariff for both the illegal importation and causing unnecessary suffering to an animal during conveyance offences. It was of the view that the current sentencing tariffs have not been effective in dealing with the increase in cross-border illegal importation of live animals. Therefore, there is a need for greater deterrence.</a></p><a id="p1_39"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a><a id="p1_40">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Prosecution submitted that should the sentences for four of the proceeded charges run consecutively given that the proceeded charges involved distinct offences. The global sentence of 64 to 80 weeks’ imprisonment would be proportionate to the Accused’s overall criminality given the number of animals involved for this importation. Moreover, since he has been charged with multiple offences, he ought not be regarded as a first offender.</a></p><a id="p1_40"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigation and Defence’s submissions on sentence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a><a id="p1_41">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence tendered a written mitigation plea and sentencing submissions. It submitted for a global sentence of not more than <u>34 weeks’ imprisonment</u> to be imposed on the Accused. A breakdown of the individual sentences to arrive at the global sentence sought is as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_41"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41"></a><a id="p1_41-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an imprisonment term of <u>5 weeks</u> for each of the proceeded charges involving illegal importation in MAC 907200, 907615 to 907619, 907622 to 907624, and 907626 of 2022;</a></p><a id="p1_41-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_41-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an imprisonment term of <u>12 weeks</u> for each of the proceeded charges of causing unnecessary suffering whilst being transported in MAC 900037-900742 of 2023, MAC 900045 to 900047 of 2023 and MAC 900049 of 2023;3 and</a></p><a id="p1_41-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_41-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;order two sentences for each type of offence namely, MAC 907200 of 2022, MAC 907615 of 2022, MAC 900037 of 2023 and MAC 900038 of 2023 to run consecutively.</a></p><a id="p1_41-p2_c"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mitigating factors raised on behalf of the Accused</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_42">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defence Counsel that the Accused has shown genuine remorse by pleading guilty and has cooperated fully with the authorities at all times.</a></p><a id="p1_42"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a><a id="p1_43">43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence highlighted that it was the Accused’s personal circumstances which led to him committing the offence of illegally importing the animals into Singapore. He came for a low-income family and is the sole provider for his aged mother who was previously suffering from cancer. He pays for her medical expenses and follow-ups.</a></p><a id="p1_43"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Reply to the aggravating factors raised by the Prosecution</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a><a id="p1_44">44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence submitted that the aggravating factors raised by the Prosecution in its submissions are misplaced.</a></p><a id="p1_44"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level of suffering caused to the animals</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a><a id="p1_45">45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence did not dispute the manner of suffering caused to the animals as described by Dr Heng and as such a deterrent sentence is necessary in the present matter.</a></p><a id="p1_45"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a><a id="p1_46">46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It raised the point that whilst Dr Heng was of the view that the cramped conditions under which the animals were transported had in all likelihood facilitated the transmission of the CPV among them, Dr Heng did not make a definitive finding that the transmission had indeed occur during the time that the animals were in the Accused’s vehicle. Moreover, the sole cat was found to be infected with FPV and NParks has confirmed that the cat could not have contracted FPV from the dogs and vice versa.</a></p><a id="p1_46"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inherent public health risk to the general public</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a><a id="p1_47">47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence did not dispute that the primary focus of the ABA is the concern over public health by safeguarding against the introduction of unwanted animal diseases into Singapore.</a></p><a id="p1_47"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a><a id="p1_48">48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it disagreed that the risk to public health is an aggravating factor but a sentencing factor that is already within the consideration in respect of an offence under s 8(1) of the ABA since this is the very basis of the ABA. This can be gleaned from the precedent cases. On top of that, there is no issue of rabies as raised by the Prosecution as none of the animals were found to have suffered from it.</a></p><a id="p1_48"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a><a id="p1_49">49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, in response to Prosecution’s position that there is an increase in public health risk since the Covid-19 pandemic, the Defence pointed out that there is no evidence that the animals in the present case had contracted Covid-19 or that Covid-19 had been transmitted from such animals even if Covid-19 is a zoonotic disease. There was clearly no actual harm in the present case.</a></p><a id="p1_49"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prevalence of animal smuggling and ready availability to illicitly imported pets</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a><a id="p1_50">50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence urged the court to consider that the statistics proffered by the Prosecution do not support the Prosecution’s position that there is a recent spike in the prevalence of illicit importation of animals in 2022 as compared to 2020 and 2021.</a></p><a id="p1_50"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a><a id="p1_51">51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the land borders between Singapore and Malaysia were closed from 18 March 2020 and 1 April 2022 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. When the borders were closed, vehicles permitted to enter Singapore could only do so for a limited purpose of transporting goods, food supplies and cargoes. Other modes of transportation like lorries, cars and boats were also not permitted to enter Singapore. There was clearly less vehicular traffic during, which arguably could explain the low figures of illegal importation of animals during in 2020 and 2021. The sufficiency of the statistics put forth by the Prosecution is lacking in evidence and therefore ought to be disregarded (citing <em>Huang Ying-Chun v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22972-SSP.xml')">[2019] 3 SLR 606</a> at [111]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52">52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, Defence Counsel highlighted that if there is any issue of prevalence of animal smuggling which necessitates an increase to the punishment prescribed by law for the ABA offences, this is best left for Parliament to legislate as evident from past cases.</a></p><a id="p1_52"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a><a id="p1_53">53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence also disagreed that the ready availability of illicitly imported pets for sale via online platforms is an aggravating factor. There was firstly no link between the Accused to any vendors found on the online platforms. The Accused never sold any animals on such platforms and none of the animals brought in by the Accused have been found to be linked to these online platforms.</a></p><a id="p1_53"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a><a id="p1_54">54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, the Defence submitted that if observations made by AVS indeed reveal that there is a prevalence of online platforms offering sale of illegally source animals for a profit, AVS ought to take the necessary action against such perpetrators.</a></p><a id="p1_54"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a><a id="p1_55">55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the potential lucrative financial gain from animal smuggling, the Defence disagreed that this is yet another aggravating factor. First, the estimated profit in respect of the animals brought by the Accused was not stated in the SOF and thus not admitted by the Accused. The Prosecution therefore could not adduce data that is unsubstantiated via the back door.</a></p><a id="p1_55"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a><a id="p1_56">56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the purpose of illegal importation of animals, like illegal importation of other items, is invariably motivated by some form of financial benefit. Therefore, relying on the High Court decision of <em>PP v Muhammad Ikrimah bon Muhammad Adrian Rogelio Galaura</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24548-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGHC 107</a> at [51]-[52] (“<em>Ikrimah</em>”), an offender’s financial motivation ought to be a neutral factor.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57">57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, as gleaned from the preamble of the ABA, the purpose of the ABA is clearly for the prevention and spread of diseases of animals as well as prevention of cruelty to animals. Financial gain or profits is not a focus of the ABA.</a></p><a id="p1_57"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a><a id="p1_58">58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the Accused himself was a mere courier who was paid RM$250 per live animal which he transported. He was neither the mastermind of the operation nor was he running or assisting to run a business involving the importation or sale of animals. Thus, the Accused has no knowledge of what the buyers stood to save or the sellers or masterminds stood to gain.</a></p><a id="p1_58"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impact on legitimate pet businesses</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a><a id="p1_59">59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Defence counsel submitted that any adverse impact on legitimate pet businesses as a consequence of illegal animal importation cannot be regarded as an aggravating factor or even a sentencing consideration. The Defence highlighted that even in cases dealing with illicit importation of contraband cigarettes, the courts have not considered harm to the legal cigarette marketplace as an aggravating factor but the quantity of the contraband items and the harm caused by consuming them: E.g. <em>Yap Ah Lai v Public Prosecutor </em></a><em><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 3 SLR 0180.xml')">[2014] 3 SLR 180</a></em> at [77] to [79].</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Difficulty of detection</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60">60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence highlighted that concealment is inherent in all importation offences. Hence, while the Accused’s act of concealing the animals is indicative of his culpability for an offence under s 8(1) of the ABA, citing <em>Ikrimah</em>, Defence Counsel said that treating all forms of concealment as an aggravating factor would lead to the conclusion that all or almost all offences of importation are aggravated. In the circumstances, difficulty of detection ought not to be a factor which is particularly aggravating in the present case and is one which is common to all the precedents cited.</a></p><a id="p1_60"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transboundary smuggling syndicate</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a><a id="p1_61">61&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence did not dispute that the Accused was part of a transborder syndicate. Nevertheless, it urged the court to consider that this is not a particularly aggravating factor in the present case given that a transborder element would be an inherent factor in illegal importation offences and factors which are inherent in an offence are generally not treated as aggravating but neutral (citing <em>Neo Ah Luan v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22630-SSP.xml')">[2018] 5 SLR 1153</a> at [80]. Besides, the facts in precedent cases would invariably have incorporated some consideration of the involvement of a transnational syndicate.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Relevant sentencing precedents</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62">62&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In support of its submission on the appropriate sentence in the present matter, the Defence tendered a table of sentencing precedents of five unreported decisions. They are annexed herein as “Annex B”.</a></p><a id="p1_62"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a><a id="p1_63">63&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the Defence’s research from the Sentencing Information and Research Repository (“SIR”) as of 8 March 2023, the median imprisonment term for an offence under s 8(1) of the ABA is 4.3 weeks and while that for a s 41C((1)(a)(iii) of the ABA offence is 8.6 weeks.</a></p><a id="p1_63"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a><a id="p1_64">64&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence urged the court to consider the case of <em>PP v Muguntan</em> (<em>“Muguntan”</em>), who was a mere courier, just like the Accused, and he attempted to smuggle 15 animals into Singapore via Tuas Checkpoint. The offender in <em>Muguntan</em> was sentenced to three weeks’ imprisonment for each s 8 of the ABA charge. The only aggravating factor in the present case when compared to that of <em>Muguntan</em> is the greater number of s 8 of the ABA charges: four proceeded, 11 TIC in <em>Muguntan</em> as compared to ten proceeded, 17 TIC in the present case.</a></p><a id="p1_64"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a><a id="p1_65">65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the Defence submitted that an uplift from the three weeks’ imprisonment ordered in <em>Muguntan</em> to a sentence of not more than five weeks’ imprisonment is warranted on the facts. The conditions of transportation in both cases such as ventilation, cramped conditions and the potential transmission of viruses do not differ greatly. Such a sentence is also higher than the four weeks’ imprisonment per charge meted out to the mastermind in <em>Muguntan</em>’s case, i.e. the offender in <em>PP v Desmond Lee</em>, who was running an unlicensed business involving the importation and sale of live animals.</a></p><a id="p1_65"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a><a id="p1_66">66&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in respect of the s 41C offence, reference can be taken from <em>Muguntan</em> where two out of the 15 animals eventually died of a combination of dehydrated state, broncho-interstitial pneumonia of probable bacterial origin, and enteritis. The offender in <em>Muguntan</em> was sentenced to eight weeks’ imprisonment per charge.</a></p><a id="p1_66"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a><a id="p1_67">67&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, the only aggravating factor in the present case when compared to <em>Muguntan</em> is the greater number of s 41C of the ABA charges – 4 proceeded, nine TIC in <em>Muguntan</em> as compared to ten proceeded, 16 TIC in the present case. Also, there were a greater number of eventual deaths of the overall animals in the present matter than in <em>Muguntan</em>.</a></p><a id="p1_67"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a><a id="p1_68">68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the Defence urged the court to consider an uplift from the eight weeks’ imprisonment ordered in <em>Muguntan</em> to a sentence of not more than 12 weeks’ imprisonment (i.e. a 1.5x uplift).</a></p><a id="p1_68"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a><a id="p1_69">69&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, the Defence submitted that a careful examination would reveal that the Prosecution’s call for 12 to 16 weeks’ imprisonment per s 8(1) ABA charge and 20 to 24 weeks’ imprisonment per s 41C(1)(a)(iii) ABA charge represented an unjustified departure from the available sentencing precedents and would amount to double counting of the sentencing factors for the two offences.</a></p><a id="p1_69"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a><a id="p1_70">70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be seen from the cases of <em>PP v Yuen Jian Iun</em> (“<em>Yuen Jian</em> Iun”) and <em>PP v Cheow Yon Siong</em> (<em>“Cheow Yon Siong”)</em>, where s 8 of the ABA charges were drafted to encompass all 23 animals, the sentence imposed was 4 months’ imprisonment. This is similar to the sentence the Prosecution is seeking per charge for each animal in the present matter. As for the s 41C of the ABA charges, the sentence was eight months’ imprisonment. Thus, the Prosecution’s position of 20 to 24 weeks’ imprisonment per charge is wholly unsupported.</a></p><a id="p1_70"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a><a id="p1_71">71&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the global sentence, the Defence did not raise any objections to the Prosecution’s proposal to run two of the sentences for each type of offence, i.e. four sentences; consecutively. This would result in a global sentence of 34 weeks’, or about 8.5 months’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_71"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a><a id="p1_72">72&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a sentence is in line with the sentences meted out in <em>Yuen Jian Iun and Cheow Yon Siong</em>. In fact, the offender in <em>Cheow Yon Siong</em> even lied to the authorities and sought to evade responsibility for his actions and did not cooperate with investigations. Finally, the suggested global sentence is in line with the totality principle as well as the one-transaction rule.</a></p><a id="p1_72"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Reply</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a><a id="p1_73">73&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution, in reply, provided an additional report from Dr Heng dated 3 April 2023. Dr Heng was of the view that the transmission of the CPV could not have occurred after the animals were removed by the authorities as they were already infected based on tests done on them prior to admission into the AQC. By facilitating the transmission of CPV through transporting the animals, this would already have led to the poorer outcomes of the animals.</a></p><a id="p1_73"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a><a id="p1_74">74&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence did not object to the tendering of this additional report. It submitted that Dr Heng, had in his report, agreed that there was a likelihood that the transmission could have already occurred prior to them being placed in the Accused’s lorry.</a></p><a id="p1_74"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a><a id="p1_75">75&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution reiterated its position that the unreported precedent cases cannot be relied upon and serve merely as guidelines: <em>Toh Suat Leng Jennifer v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27680-SSP.xml')">[2022] SGHC 146</a> (<em>“Jennifer Toh”</em>). In fact, they ought to be ignored in the present case given that the sentences previously imposed by the courts have been ineffective.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76">76&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, the precedent cases relied on by the Defence could either be distinguished on the facts or are dated such that they are no longer applicable in today’s environment, especially in a post-Covid-19 era even though there is no evidence here that the animals have been traced with Covid-19 or that they increase the risk of spreading it.</a></p><a id="p1_76"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a><a id="p1_77">77&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even during the Covid-19 pandemic where there was a closure of land borders between Singapore and Malaysia, vehicles transporting goods, food supplies and cargoes could continue to enter Singapore.

In respect of s 41C, he said:</a></p><a id="p1_87"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">I shall now go through and explain the rationale of the main features of the Bill.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A new section 41C is <em>proposed to place legal responsibility on owners and persons in charge of animals to provide proper care for them so that the welfare of animals is attended to in a way that they are cared for and not just limited to punishing acts of cruelty after such acts had taken place.</em> Existing clauses in the current section 42 associated with providing care are shifted to the new section 41C.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sir, the Codes of Animal Welfare have been formulated by the Multi-stakeholder Collaboration Committee (MSCC), which includes most of the AWLRC members, and chaired by Member Alex Yam. The Codes stipulate what constitutes proper care. There are specific codes for pet owners and pet businesses. The Codes have undergone stakeholder and public consultations before being finalised, and had been presented by the MSCC to AVA in July 2014. Upon acceptance and issuance of the Codes by AVA, should the Bill be passed by Parliament and gazetted into law, these Codes can be used for enforcement by AVA against failure to provide duty of care. While the Codes are not legislated, failure to meet the Codes can be used as evidence to support prosecution. However, AVA will not prosecute a person purely because of a breach of the Codes. The new sections 41A and 41B set out the legal provisions for the issuance, adoption and amendment of the Codes, as well as the use of the Codes in proceedings.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sir, <em>the proposed definition of "person in charge" will include a person who has the animal in the person's possession, custody or control, or under that person's care or supervision, whether permanently or on a temporary basis and the definition of owner would include persons in charge.</em> This includes pet owners as well as those working with animals and handling animals in the course of their work, for instance, pet industry workers. The duty of care would also extend to include those who do not own the animals but care for them in a shelter or in their homes, including fosterers, hoarders and those looking after the pets of the family members or friends. [emphasis added]</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a><a id="p1_88">88&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S 41C of the ABA is intended to protect the welfare of animals and deter animal abuse in Singapore. Pertinently, when it was enacted, there was no enhancement of the penalties for a first offender, like the Accused, under s 41C(1)(a)(iii) of the ABA in that the maximum punishment prescribed by law is a fine of $10,000 or an imprisonment of up to 12 months under s 41C(3)(b)(i) of the ABA.</a></p><a id="p1_88"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a><a id="p1_89">89&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is apparent that the legislative intent for the illegal importation offence differs somewhat from that for the causing unnecessary suffering to an animal during conveyance offence.

The Bill did propose, and which was eventually passed, to establish separate and higher penalties for offenders who have committed the offence in the course of carrying on or employed in animal-related businesses as this is to recognise that businesses are more profit motivated and thus more financially capable of paying the fine such that a higher fine quantum will be a greater deterrent: see s 41C(3)(a)(i) of the ABA. Since the Accused here is not considered to have committed the offence of causing the animals to suffer during conveyance in the course of employment in relation to an animal-related business as defined under s 41 of the ABA, the higher penalty is not applicable to him.</a></p><a id="p1_90"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a><a id="p1_91">91&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I agree with the Defence that as these offences relate to two separately protected interests, in determining the individual sentence for each of them, the sentencing factors ought to be considered separately to avoid double counting.</a></p><a id="p1_91"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a><a id="p1_92">92&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, in a case of illegal importation, in order to avoid detection from the authorities, the offender will inevitably cause an animal to suffer unnecessarily during conveyance. There is hence an overlap. The issue invariably is a question of the manner, extent and degree as well as whether the animal survives the journey eventually or what is its condition post-trip.</a></p><a id="p1_92"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a><a id="p1_93">93&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the approach to be taken in determining the aggregate sentence for offenders convicted of multiple charges, is it apposite to seek guidance from the analytical framework as enunciated in the High Court decision of <em>PP v Raveen Balakrishnan</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22604-SSP.xml')">[2018] 5 SLR 799</a> (“<em>Raveen”)</em> where it was held at [98]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">In summary, the relevant principles in sentencing a multiple offender are as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first stage of the sentencing analysis is <em>for the sentencing court to consider the appropriate sentence for each offence</em>. This may be done in a number of ways, including by application of a sentencing framework or benchmark, or by analogy to precedents. In arriving at the individual sentences, the sentencing court will generally have to consider the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors that bear upon each discrete sentence (see [37] above).</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second stage of the sentencing analysis is <em>to determine how the individual sentences should run</em>. In this regard, the starting point of the analysis is whether the offences are unrelated and this is determined by considering whether they involve a single invasion of the same legally protected interest (see [68]–[70] above). As a general rule, sentences for unrelated offences should run consecutively, while sentences for offences that form part of a single transaction should run concurrently, subject to the requirement in s 307(1) of the CPC. If there is a mix of related and unrelated offences, the sentences for those offences that are unrelated should generally run consecutively with one of the sentences for the related offences (see [53]–[55] above). This general rule may be departed from so long as the sentencing court applies its mind to consider whether this is appropriate and explains its reasons for doing so. Statutory provisions may also abridge the operation of the general rule (see [64]–[67] above).</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third stage of the sentencing analysis is <em>to apply the totality principle and take a “last look” at all the facts and circumstances to ensure that the aggregate sentence is sufficient and proportionate to the offender’s overall criminality</em> (see [73] above). Specifically, there are two limbs to the totality principle. First, the court should examine whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed. Second, the court should examine whether the effect of the sentence on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with his past record and future prospects. The court should also bear in mind the aggregation principle which provides that the totality principle ordinarily applies with greater force in cases that involve longer aggregate sentences (see [79]–[80] above). If an aggregate sentence is considered excessive, the sentencing court may opt for a different combination of sentences to run consecutively or adjust the individual sentences (see [73] above). In this regard, while it is within the court’s power to select sentences other than the longest individual sentence to run consecutively, the aggregate of such sentences must exceed the longest individual sentence (see <em>Shouffee</em> ([2] <em>supra</em>) at [77]) and, if appropriate, the court should state explicitly the individual sentence that would otherwise have been imposed for the offence but for the adjustment on account of the totality principle (see <em>Shouffee</em> at [66]).</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across all stages of the analysis, <em>the sentencing court should be careful not to offend the rule against double counting. The central concern of this rule is that a sentencing factor should be given only its due weight in the sentencing analysis and nothing more.</em> The rule underlies all aspects of sentencing. It applies to both aggravating and mitigating factors, and it may arise in cases involving single offences as it does in cases involving multiple offending. However, it does not necessarily violate the rule against double counting if a fact constituting a mitigating factor is again taken into account in the application of the totality principle even though it has been given effect to elsewhere in the sentencing analysis (see [91]–[94] above).

The truth of this should not be understated.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">No two cases are ever alike. <em>The value of a particular sentencing precedent in determining the sentence to be imposed in a subsequent case is ultimately dependent on the degree of factual similarity between the two cases, including the offence-specific and offender-specific factors identified.</em> Making bare references to outcomes in precedent cases without consideration of the detailed reasoning leading to those outcomes is ultimately an unproductive exercise.

He did so by driving his lorry which was provided by his employer for the original purpose of transporting construction material into Singapore.</a></p><a id="p1_111"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a><a id="p1_112">112&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept the Defence’s submission that the Accused was not a mastermind or even an agent of the transnational syndicate who was running or assisting to run an unlicenced business involving the sale of illegally imported live animals, whether by way of any online platforms or otherwise. Where the offender is a mastermind or perhaps even an agent who was running the business, his culpability would be higher.</a></p><a id="p1_112"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge of the licensing requirement </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a><a id="p1_113">113&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused was acutely aware that it was illegal for him to smuggle the live animals into Singapore without a valid licence. This was because the Accused knew that the animals were already pre-packed into either boxes, containers or zipped laundry/nylon bags and they would have to be hidden inside the various compartments of the Accused’s lorry to avoid detection from the authorities when crossing the land borders between Singapore and Malaysia.</a></p><a id="p1_113"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a><a id="p1_114">114&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, when the Accused was arrested for the present offence, this was not his first trip as previously, he had made successful trips for the syndicate since 2021 and he would make about two to three trips a month. This further indicates the difficulty to detect such an offence.</a></p><a id="p1_114"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scale of the operation </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a><a id="p1_115">115&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By being a courier, he was part of a transnational syndicate involved in illegal animal smuggling. His contact in Malaysia included Dido and Komo. The Accused took delivery of the live animals as well as instructions from them for the entire delivery process to the buyers from Malaysia to Singapore.</a></p><a id="p1_115"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a><a id="p1_116">116&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Prosecution’s submission on the prevalence of illegal pet sales available on online sales platforms, I am of the view that little or no weight ought to be given since this is unsubstantiated and there is no evidence before this court that there is a discernible link between the Accused and the illegal online sellers. For the same reason, neither is the article on pet shops in Johor offering pet smuggling services into Singapore from Channel News Asia dated 4 February 2023 produced by the Prosecution of any assistance to the court.</a></p><a id="p1_116"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Importation for the purpose of sale or trade </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a><a id="p1_117">117&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused would receive a financial gain for each trip by the syndicate. He would be paid RM250 per live animal that was successfully smuggled and delivered to the buyers in Singapore. Therefore, for this trip if the Accused was successful, he would have earned RM6,750. The more animals he smuggled, the more he would earn. Yet, the higher risk he would need to take to avoid detection.</a></p><a id="p1_117"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a><a id="p1_118">118&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, I did not consider the statistics adduced by the Prosecution on the price savings potential buyers would have gained if the animals were smuggled into Singapore successfully by the Accused. The prices stated in the table were approximates based on the Prosecution’s horizon scanning exercise conducted between 7 November 2022 and 11 November 2022 by taking a random sampling across two media platforms. They are not supported by any formal findings and presented before this court.</a></p><a id="p1_118"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a><a id="p1_119">119&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, there is no evidence that the figures reflect the actual financial gain or profit of the Accused in the present case and the Accused has not admitted to them as his potential financial gain in the SOF.</a></p><a id="p1_119"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a><a id="p1_120">120&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept that illegal pet trading is likely to be a financially profitable business such that syndicates are motivated to take calculated risks to smuggle the animals into Singapore. To attract potential buyers, it is inevitable that the illegal pet businesses will price themselves cheaper than the legitimate businesses, particularly with the ready accessibility and convenience using online platforms. Otherwise, these buyers would simply have opted to purchase their pets from legitimate local pet businesses. Accordingly, the fact that the illicit pet trade is lucrative and is readily available online and thereby potentially affecting legitimate pet business adversely ought not be considered as an aggravating factor against the Accused as proposed by the Prosecution but a neutral factor.</a></p><a id="p1_120"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a><a id="p1_121">121&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the legislative intent of the ABA is to prevent and control animal-related diseases into and in Singapore as well as to protect the health of Singaporeans from transmissible animal-related diseases more effectively. To deter these illegal online pet businesses, there may be a need for a more robust enforcement to shut down or remove them from the various online sales or social media platforms. This will remove the accessibility for potential buyers to purchase pets through illegal sources.</a></p><a id="p1_121"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a><a id="p1_122">122&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should also be public education to inform the public not to purchase pets from such illegal pet businesses but only from licenced or accredited business operators in the interest of protecting public health from unwarranted animal-related diseases through the necessary quarantine, vaccinations and health checks done for the animals.</a></p><a id="p1_122"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harm caused to the animal including any potential risk of infection or transmission of diseases </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a><a id="p1_123">123&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will deal with the harm caused to the animals collectively. The number of live animals involved was significant. There were 26 dogs and one cat, totalling 27 animals.</a></p><a id="p1_123"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a><a id="p1_124">124&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One dog was found dead when recovered from the Accused’s lorry placed in a nylon bag. The cause of death was due to GDV, which is a life-threatening condition where the stomach of an animal dilates and twists due to excessive panting and ingesting large volumes of air from insufficient ventilation leading to obstruction of blood circulation and thereafter death.</a></p><a id="p1_124"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a><a id="p1_125">125&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the remaining 26 live animals, 16 dogs were tested positive for CPV and the cat was tested positive for FPV at the time of admission into AQC. Some of the animals recovered were in a very weak condition or had medical issues. Eventually, all 24 dogs developed CPV infection with varying degrees of severity. Within about a month, 15 dogs passed away while three dogs were euthanised due to welfare reasons. The cause of death all arose from CPV infection. As such, there was a high mortality rate as a total of 19 animals out of 27 animals died (about 70%).</a></p><a id="p1_125"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a><a id="p1_126">126&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept Dr Heng’s opinion that none of the animals could have been infected by CPV after they were seized by the authorities. I further accept his opinion that it is possible that the transmission of the CPV could already have occurred prior to the dogs being placed in the Accused’s lorry since symptoms can arise three to 15 days after infection. Nevertheless, I note too that cramped and poorly ventilated plastic container boxes or nylon bags in which the animals were transported in to avoid detection coupled with the unsanitary conditions caused by diarrhoea would in all likelihood facilitate the transmission of CPV among the dogs recovered.</a></p><a id="p1_126"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a><a id="p1_127">127&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, for the ten proceeded charges, all the dogs have died.</a></p><a id="p1_127"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a><a id="p1_128">128&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, for each proceeded charge, having analysed the offence-specific sentencing factors and compared them with the precedents, I assess the indicative starting sentence of the Accused at two months’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_128"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a><a id="p1_129">129&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the offender-specific factors.</a></p><a id="p1_129"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a><a id="p1_130">130&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For aggravating factors, the Accused has 17 TIC illegal importation charges in respect of the remaining 17 out of 27 animals. For these 17 animals, 1 was the white French bulldog, which was dead on arrival, five were subsequently dead, three were euthanised for welfare reasons and eight were alive but tested positive for CPV.</a></p><a id="p1_130"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a><a id="p1_131">131&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the mitigating factors raised by the Accused, I have taken into consideration his early plea of guilt, remorsefulness, cooperation with the authorities since his arrest and the fact that he is a first offender. This is similar to the offenders for the precedents cited by parties.</a></p><a id="p1_131"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a><a id="p1_132">132&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution submitted that the Accused should not be regarded as a first offender because he has been charged with multiple offence by citing <em>Chen Weixiong Jerri</em>ek <em>v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/38-M.xml')">[2003] SGHC 2</a> SLR(R) 334 (<em>“Jerriek”</em>). I am of the view that the facts in <em>Jerriek</em> can be distinguished as the offender had committed the seven offences comprising of three different types of offences separately on different occasions as well as against different victims, the Accused here had committed the two types of offences on 27 animals arising out of one occasion. This was effectively a single transaction.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133">133&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, given the aggravating factor in this case, as highlighted at [21] of <em>Jerriek</em>, the present situation appears to be such that the mitigating effect afforded by the Accused’s plea of guilt is entirely outweighed by the clear need for a deterrent sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_133"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a><a id="p1_134">134&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in weighing the aggravating and mitigating factors, I decline to give any downward adjustment to the indicative starting sentence but impose a sentence of <u>two months’ imprisonment</u> per charge.</a></p><a id="p1_134"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a><a id="p1_135">135&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparison with the precedents, the sentence imposed is a rather significant uplift from the three weeks’ imprisonment in <em>Muguntan</em> for 13 dogs (2 died), four weeks’ imprisonment in <em>Desmond Lee</em> for abetting Muguntan as well as 6 weeks’ imprisonment in <em>Yogalingam</em> and <em>Siva</em> for 17 dogs (1 died).

Therefore, I am mindful of the sentences imposed for cases with consolidated charges.</a></p><a id="p1_139"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a><a id="p1_140">140&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the sentence imposed per charge, the median sentence was 8.6 (or about nine) weeks’ imprisonment and the mean sentence was 10.1 (or about ten) weeks’ imprisonment.

As for the sentence imposed per charge, the median sentence was six weeks’ imprisonment and the mean was 5.7 (or about six) weeks’ imprisonment. Therefore, based on the sentencing trend for the relevant period, the Prosecution is correct to say that the usual sentencing range for a single charge of causing unnecessary suffering whilst being transported is about <u>eight to ten weeks’ imprisonment</u>.</a></p><a id="p1_141"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a><a id="p1_142">142&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now highlight a few of the relevant cases, including those raised by the parties.</a></p><a id="p1_142"> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="7.86%"><col width="41.98%"><col width="50.16%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class="br" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(i)</p> </td><td class="b" colspan="2" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <em>Ravinchandran Muthusamy (SC-902922-2017)</em> </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(<em>“Ravinchandran”</em>)</p> </td></tr><tr><td class="br" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p> </td><td class="br" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b><u>Culpability of the offender</u></b> </p> </td><td class="b" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p> </td></tr><tr><td class="br" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(a)</p> </td><td class="br" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Degree of pain or suffering caused to the animal including any steps taken to prevent unnecessary suffering </p> </td><td class="b" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Ravinchandran smuggled 11 live puppies from Malaysia to Singapore by cramping them into a modified compartment in a car. </p> </td></tr><tr><td class="br" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(b)</p> </td><td class="br" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Manner of confining and transporting the animal</p> </td><td class="b" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The live puppies were hidden in a modified compartment under the back passenger seat of the car.

There was no evidence as to the condition of the said animals or whether any of them died after the journey.

It is also the same as the sentence imposed on <em>Yeun Jian Iun</em> and <em>Cheow Yong Siong</em> for the consolidated s 41C(1) charge involving 23 dogs (11 died).
