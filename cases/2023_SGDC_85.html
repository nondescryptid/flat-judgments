The Charge stated that Norasid had, without authorisation, consumed methamphetamine (a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act {“MDA”}) on or before 1 December 2020. This was an offence under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA.</a></p><a id="p1_1"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing all the evidence and having considered the closing submissions from the Prosecution and the Defence, I found that the Prosecution had proven its case against Norasid beyond a reasonable doubt and convicted him accordingly.</a></p><a id="p1_2"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The particular offence Norasid was convicted of was punishable under s 33A(2) of the MDA. Such an offence is commonly referred to as an “LT2 offence”, and is punishable with a mandatory minimum imprisonment term of seven years, and mandatory minimum six strokes of the cane.</a></p><a id="p1_3"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norasid’s liability to be punished for an LT2 offence arose from his previous antecedent for drug consumption, punishable under s 33A(1) of the MDA (commonly referred to as an “LT1 offence”).</a></p><a id="p1_4"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Charge recited Norasid’s LT1 antecedent. On 14 August 2002, Norasid had been convicted of an LT1 offence (where he had consumed morphine) and was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of five years and nine months, and three strokes of the cane.</a></p><a id="p1_5"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Norasid was convicted, I heard the Prosecution’s submission on sentence (presented by the Deputy Public Prosecutor {“DPP”}), the mitigation plea on behalf of Norasid and the Defence’s submission on sentence. Besides the aforesaid LT1 antecedent, Norasid had also been convicted of an LT2 offence on 23 July 2009 and had then been sentenced to imprisonment for a term of eight years, and six strokes of the cane.</a></p><a id="p1_6"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the present offence for which Norasid had just been convicted of (for consumption of methamphetamine on or before 1 December 2020) was his second LT2 offence and conviction. After a careful consideration of the mitigation plea put forth (for which it was considered that no downward adjustment ought to be applied to an otherwise appropriate sentence to be meted out), and the respective parties’ submissions on sentence, I sentenced Norasid to imprisonment for a term of eight years and six months, and six strokes of the cane. The sentence was backdated to the date of arrest, 14 March 2021.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norasid appealed against conviction and sentence, and is currently serving sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At trial, Norasid was represented by Defence Counsel (“DC”). The Prosecution and the Defence had agreed to a Statement of Agreed Facts (“SOAF”) being tendered pursuant to s 267 of the Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC”).</a></p><a id="p1_9"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SOAF was signed by the DPP and the DC (on behalf of Norasid). Pursuant to s 267 of the CPC, the admission of the facts as set out in the SOAF was (as against Norasid) “conclusive evidence” of the facts admitted.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SOAF narrated that on 1 December 2020, a raiding party consisting of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) raided a flat at Mei Ling Street and placed Norasid under arrest. Norasid was brought to the Tanglin Police Division Headquarters for investigations.</a></p><a id="p1_11"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following his arrest and whilst at Tanglin Police Division Headquarters, Norasid provided two bottles of his urine samples which were sealed in his presence. The said urine samples were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) on 2 December 2020, for analysis.</a></p><a id="p1_12"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 24 December 2020, two analysts from the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA issued two separate certificates under s 16 of the MDA. Each of the two analysts had certified that the respective urine sample of Norasid’s that had been tested by them, was found to contain methamphetamine. Methamphetamine is a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, each of the two urine samples that Norasid had provided were found to contain methamphetamine. Norasid was not authorised to consume methamphetamine.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SOAF went on to recite the details of Norasid’s LT1 conviction (as per [5] above) and confirmed that this conviction and the punishment for the LT1 offence had not been set aside to date.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in [10], Norasid’s admission to the facts set out in the SOAF (summarised in [11] to [15] above), led to the result that this amounted to “conclusive evidence” of these material facts.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As provided in s 22 of the MDA, “If any controlled drug is found in the urine of a person as a result of both urine tests conducted under section 31(4)(b), he shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have consumed that controlled drug in contravention of section 8(b).”</a></p><a id="p1_17"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the material ingredients of the offence were made out as against Norasid. Norasid, by virtue of the presumption in s 22 of the MDA, was presumed (unless the contrary could be proved by Norasid) to have consumed methamphetamine in contravention of s 8(b) of the MDA. As confirmed by the SOAF, Norasid was not authorised to consume methamphetamine.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norasid’s defence at trial was that he had not consumed methamphetamine at the material time. Norasid had to prove this on a balance of probabilities. In his cautioned statement (admitted as D1), Norasid had stated, “Kindly check the evidence in my case. Many times I was arrested and tested positive initially but the HSA was negative. And there was some error. I have been clean for 6 years and never consumed any kind controlled drug. So I feel that there might be some error in the urine testing. I have nothing else to say.”</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pertinent to note that, at the time Norasid gave his cautioned statement (15 March 2021, less than four months after the alleged offence) his defence was vague in its detail. He makes the blanket assertion that he had “been clean for six years”, but does not state what exactly, in his mind, was wrong with the urine procurement process or testing. He asserted that he had, on several previous occasions, been “tested positive initially but the HSA was negative” and concludes that there was “some error”. He reiterated that he felt “that there might be some error in the urine testing”. Norasid concluded the cautioned statement substantively by stating that he had “nothing else to say”.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norasid’s precise challenge of the “urine testing” was raised at trial and was fleshed out in the Closing Submissions tendered by the Defence. First, Norasid alleged that though he had washed his hands on the two occasions he had to provide his urine specimen, he had not dried his hands. Norasid’s second specific challenge of the urine procurement process was that after the first attempt to provide urine (where Norasid was unable to provide a sufficient volume of urine), he was directed by one of three escorting officers to leave a small bottle at the toilet. Norasid alleged that there had been three escorting officers including Wee Heng Long Roy (“PW1”), and that the officer who had told Norasid to leave one small bottle in the toilet was not PW1 but one of the other two escorting officers.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norasid further alleged that for the second attempt to provide sufficient urine, he was “told to bring two small bottles to the toilet where he then provided sufficient urine into a master bottle. However, he was not sure whether he had selected the small bottle that was earlier left at the toilet and hence, whether urine from the master bottle was poured into this said small bottle.”</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ease of reference, Norasid’s two allegations may be referred to as the “water contamination assertion” and the “third small bottle assertion” respectively.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the Prosecution’s position that Norasid had dried his hands on the two said occasions that he had been directed to wash his hands. With respect to the third small bottle assertion, the Prosecution’s stand was that this had not happened: there was no third small bottle in the toilet, and that PW1 was the only escorting officer (escorting Norasid for the urine procurement) on the material date.</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the evidence, I rejected both the water contamination assertion and the third small bottle assertion. Overall, there were no incidents that may have affected the integrity of the urine procurement process or the urine testing of Norasid’s urine samples. Norasid had failed to rebut the presumption of consumption of methamphetamine, and the Prosecution had proven its case against Norasid beyond a reasonable doubt.</a></p><a id="p1_25"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, it should be noted that Norasid had not, in his cautioned statement (D1), made any mention of the water contamination assertion or the third small bottle assertion. In Norasid’s Case for the Defence (“CFD”, admitted as P6), whilst Norasid alleges that there had been “two unidentified CNB officers” who had, together with PW1, escorted him for his first attempt to provide his urine specimen, there was no reference at all to the water contamination assertion or to the third small bottle assertion. In fact, the contents of the CFD amount to an implied admission on Norasid’s part that he had indeed consumed methamphetamine. We shall return to this point later.</a></p><a id="p1_26"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main plank of the Prosecution’s case relied on the evidence of PW1. At the time of the procurement of Norasid’s urine sample, PW1 was a Sergeant in CNB. He had left CNB in 2021. PW1 was the escorting officer and sealing officer for the purposes of procuring Norasid’s urine sample. He had escorted Norasid and ensured that it was Norasid’s urine that was collected. PW1 was also responsible, as the sealing officer, for sealing the bottles of the urine specimen.</a></p><a id="p1_27"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW1 said that in his approximately eight years in CNB, he had procured urine samples from “at least few hundred, perhaps a thousand” suspects. PW1 confirmed that the Instant Urine Test (“IUT”) carried out at the time of the urine procurement produced the result shown in the Urine Test Result Slip (admitted as P5, which showed that Amphetamine had been present in Norasid’s urine sample).</a></p><a id="p1_28"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW1 described the process involved in the obtaining of Norasid’s urine sample. PW1 first came into contact with Norasid at the Instant Urine Test room at Tanglin Police Division Headquarters (“IUT room”).</a></p><a id="p1_29"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the IUT room, PW1 instructed Norasid to wash his hands and then dry his hands. Norasid washed his hands at a basin in the IUT room. Norasid then dried his hands, using paper from tissue rolls on the table in the IUT room. PW1 then instructed Norasid to proceed to a cabinet in the IUT room to collect “one master bottle and two small bottles”. The master bottle is bigger than the small bottles and is covered with a red lid. The small bottles have blue lids.</a></p><a id="p1_30"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master bottle was chosen by Norasid from a collection of “at least more than 10” such similar bottles. Each bottle is unused and separately sealed in plastic packaging. Norasid also had to select two small bottles from a collection of “more than 20” such bottles. The small bottles are also unused and sealed individually in plastic packaging. The bottles would be removed form their respective packaging by Norasid. PW1 indicated that removal of the bottles from the packaging would occur in the toilet (where the urine is procured). PW1 explained that if a bottle were to be dropped on the floor by a suspect, on the way to the toilet, that suspect would be required to discard the dropped bottle and select a replacement bottle. This careful step would be undertaken by PW1 whether or not the bottle was still wrapped in plastic or had been unwrapped.</a></p><a id="p1_31"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Norasid had selected the master bottle and the two small bottles, PW1 escorted him to a toilet near (about five to 10 metres away) the IUT room. PW1 affirmed that he was the only escorting officer escorting Norasid on that day. PW1 stated that it was “common practice” for there to be only one escorting officer for a suspect. When asked by the DPP whether there were situations where more than one escorting officer was required, PW1 said that such situations were “very rare” and involved cases of violent suspects. PW1 affirmed that in Norasid’s case, only one escorting officer was required.</a></p><a id="p1_32"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW1 said that Norasid was the one holding onto the master bottle and the two small bottles from the IUT room to the toilet. Upon entering the toilet, PW1 instructed Norasid to remove the packaging for the master bottle. Norasid had to urinate into the master bottle. At this time the two small bottles (still in their packaging) were on a ledge, within sight of Norasid. At this attempt, Norasid was not able to supply the full volume of urine required (PW1 indicated that Norasid was only able to supply about 20 ml of the 80 ml required).</a></p><a id="p1_33"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norasid was then instructed to open one of the small bottles and to pour some of the urine from the master bottle into that small bottle. Norasid was asked to hold on to the other (unwrapped) small bottle. Norasid was then instructed to close the two opened bottles (the master bottle and the opened small bottle). PW1 then escorted Norasid back to the IUT room. Norasid carried all three bottles with him.</a></p><a id="p1_34"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back at the IUT room, the IUT was carried out using the urine from the small bottle. At this time, the master bottle and the unused small bottle were still with Norasid. After urine was siphoned out of the small bottle for the IUT, Norasid was instructed to discard this (used) small bottle. Norasid did so.</a></p><a id="p1_35"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master bottle and the unused small bottle were placed in a clear plastic bag, sealed (done by PW1 in the presence of Norasid) and given to Norasid for him to hold onto. Norasid was then told to consume more water from the water dispenser in the IUT room, in order for him to produce more urine later.</a></p><a id="p1_36"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once Norasid was ready to produce further urine, he was again told by PW1 to wash his hands using the basin in the IUT room and then dry them. PW1 witnessed Norasid washing his hands and then drying them. Norasid was then told to select one more small bottle (unused and wrapped). Norasid did so and was again escorted to the same toilet by PW1. Norasid still held onto the sealed package containing the master bottle and the (unused) small bottle, and was now also holding the newly selected small bottle. PW1 confirmed that he was the only escorting officer escorting Norasid.</a></p><a id="p1_37"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the toilet, Norasid was told to remove the master bottle from the sealed big package. Norasid was told to urinate into the master bottle. The two small bottles (still in their individual wrapping) were on a ledge within Norasid’s line of sight. Norasid was able to provide sufficient urine this time round. He was then instructed by PW1 to remove the two small bottles form their individual packaging. Norasid was to then pour the urine from the master bottle into the two small bottles. He did so. Norasid then held onto the three bottles and was escorted back to the IUT room. At the IUT room, Norasid was instructed to discard the master bottle.</a></p><a id="p1_38"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two small bottles were then prepared for submission for analysis by HSA. PW1’s recitation of this preparation sequence indicated that the actions for this stage of the process were properly carried out. In any event, Norasid’s challenges at trial focused on the steps taken before the rendering of the urine samples into the two small bottles, and not to this stage of the process. As stated in the SOAF, the results of the analysis showed that both urine samples contained methamphetamine.</a></p><a id="p1_39"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a><a id="p1_40">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under rigorous cross-examination, PW1 maintained his position on the key points of his evidence. PW1 affirmed that he was the only officer escorting Norasid on that day. PW1 was also sure that he witnessed Norasid drying his hands after washing them (on both occasions Norasid had to wash his hands).</a></p><a id="p1_40"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a><a id="p1_41">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW1 further denied the DC’s suggestion that there had been another escorting officer who told Norasid to leave one small bottle on the ledge in the toilet. PW1 denied that there had ever been three small bottles in the toilet as alleged by Norasid. PW1 did not give any evidence under cross-examination that was contrary to his evidence in examination-in-chief.</a></p><a id="p1_41"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a><a id="p1_42">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In examination-in-chief, Norasid said that he had been arrested together with his brother at the Mei Ling Street flat and both of them had been brought to the Tanglin Police Station. On the material aspects that were in dispute, Norasid’s position was that he had not dried his hands after washing them (on both occasions). Norasid said that there had been three escorting officers and that his brother was brought to the toilet at the same time that he (Norasid) was. Crucially, the allegation that Norasid’s brother had been in the toilet at the same time Norasid was there, was never put to PW1 in cross-examination. The DC had suggested to PW1 that Norasid’s brother was in the IUT room, but had never put or suggested to PW1 that Norasid’s brother was also in the toilet at the same time. I found that Norasid’s evidence that his brother had been in the toilet at the same time to be a fabrication. If indeed Norasid’s brother had been present at the toilet at the same time as Norasid, this would have thrown a different angle on PW1’s evidence, and yet this point was never put nor suggested to PW1. For completeness, Norasid later indicated that he was unaware of his brother’s present whereabouts. However, the point was that this crucial allegation was not put nor suggested to PW1.</a></p><a id="p1_42"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a><a id="p1_43">43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norasid had given his version of another officer telling him to leave one small bottle in the toilet. For the second attempt at urine procurement, Norasid said that PW1 was the only escorting officer. Norasid said he had placed the two small bottles on the same ledge where the previous small bottle had allegedly been placed before the earlier return to the IUT room. Norasid said that PW1 had not objected to his (Norasid’s) placing the small bottles together with the earlier small bottle on the ledge. This piece of Norasid’s evidence simply could not be believed. PW1 had in his evidence-in-chief (and confirmed under the rigorous cross-examination) impressed as a very careful officer. Amongst other areas of care demonstrated by PW1 was ensuring that the chain of movement of the bottles (master as well as the small bottles) was carefully observed. It was unbelievable for a careful officer such as PW1 to have allowed Norasid to “mix” the two small bottles with this allegedly earlier-placed small bottled. Similarly I did not believe that PW1 would have allowed Norasid to not dry his hands after having washed them.</a></p><a id="p1_43"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a><a id="p1_44">44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was only during cross-examination by the DPP that Norasid first raised the possibility that his alleged non-drying of his hands may have led to “contamination”. The Defence did not call any expert evidence to show that undried hands (and this must mean water on his undried hands) could possibly lead to contamination of the urine samples. In any event, I found, as a fact, that Norasid had indeed dried his hands. It was only during <em>re-examination</em> that Norasid tried to explain why he thought there may be contamination with his undried hands. His explanation that there could be “substances on the table” and that he had “touched there” and that the “water could have dropped inside (the bottle(s))” was clearly speculative and could only be regarded as an afterthought on his part. The water contamination assertion simply had no supportive basis and was thus rejected.</a></p><a id="p1_44"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a><a id="p1_45">45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norasid was cross-examined on the CFD (which had been filed in 2022, after his cautioned statement). In the CFD, Norasid had impliedly admitted to having illegally consumed methamphetamine. He had cited a Ministerial statement made in Parliament in January 2019, and asserted that he should be sent to a DRC (Drug Rehabilitation Centre – an “approved institution” as provided for in the MDA) instead of being tried in Court for an LT2 offence. Norasid does not make any mention of the water contamination assertion and the third small bottle assertion in the CFD. Instead, Norasid stated (in conjunction with his plea to be sent to a DRC), “I do not have any desired (<em>sic</em>) to delay my case or to fight my consumption offence of LT2 … in the trial.” To “qualify” to be sent to a DRC, it would have been clear to Norasid that he had indeed knowingly consumed methamphetamine whilst not being authorised to do so. To plead to be sent to a DRC was therefore an implied admission of his guilt.</a></p><a id="p1_45"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a><a id="p1_46">46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, I found that PW1 was a truthful witness, who had no reason to frame Norasid. The evidence of PW1 on the material points was clear and certain, and there was no doubt in my mind that the version given by PW1 was clearly to be preferred over Norasid’s.</a></p><a id="p1_46"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a><a id="p1_47">47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water contamination assertion and the third small bottle assertion had no basis whatsoever and could not be believed. In the cautioned statement, Norasid makes no specific reference to these two assertions. In the CFD, again, there was no specific mention of these two assertions. The two assertions were clearly afterthoughts, and did not have the ring of truth about them. The finding was clear: there had been nothing wrong with the urine procurement process, and the Prosecution had proven its case against Norasid beyond a reasonable doubt. Before delivering the Verdict, I made some oral remarks and the following is a reproduction of these oral remarks (taken <em>verbatim</em> from the transcription of the notes of evidence for this trial).</a></p><a id="p1_47"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a><a id="p1_48">48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Start of oral remarks.) “When one considers the Statement of Agreed Facts, one can summarise that the real point in dispute here is whether there was lapse in the urine procurement process in which case the integrity of the result would be called into question. Because in the Statement of Agreed Facts, it is quite clear that it is accepted that the two bottles which purportedly contained the urine samples from Mr Norasid tested positive for methamphetamine. Should the matter rest at that finding, then Mr Norasid would be guilty as charged. So what we would have to consider would be, as I’ve stated, the integrity of the process.</a></p><a id="p1_48"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a><a id="">Now, one way to look at the evidence of the escorting officer really is this: I take the point that Mr Teo has urged the Court to consider and that was that this matter happened some time ago. It was way back in December 2020 and the defence has called into question whether a witness who perhaps carried several such tests over a period of time would be able to remember all the details. But from listening to the evidence given by the escorting officer, the way to view it really is this: If there was anything untoward about the process, that would have been more memorable than if the process had gone through smoothly. Even in this particular case where Mr Norasid was not able to give sufficient urine the first time, this is an occurrence that is not unusual. So looking at the evidence, it would appear primarily that the evidence of the escorting officer was that there was nothing untoward about the urine procurement process which stood out, which made it something for him to remember. The evidence of the escorting officer in response to the two main points that the defence raised really was this, that Mr Norasid had dried his hands after washing them the two times and that there had not been a bottle a small bottle left on the ledge of the toilet. Now this is very important because leaving a bottle out of sight of an of a suspect would immediately call into question - the integrity the procurement process. I find that it is not believable that Mr Norasid would have been told by any officer to just leave a bottle in the toilet when the process suggests that these bottles, whether the master bottle and/or the small bottles, must always be in the possession, so to speak, of a suspect who has to give his urine sample.</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id="">The other aspect of the prosecution’s case really is this: If it is the defence case that the result itself was wrong, I take the prosecution’s point that in the circumstances of the case, there’s a strong suggestion that the raising of the defence as it did at the time it did suggests that it was an afterthought. When the cautioned statement was taken - and this is at D1 - and this was let me just confirm the date. It appears to be in March 2021, cautioned statement was taken. This is what the accused said:</a></p><a id=""> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“Kindly check evidence in my case. Many times I was arrested and tested positive initially, but the HSA was negative and there was some error. I had been clean for 6 years and never consumed any kind of controlled drug. So I feel that there might be some error in the urine testing. I have nothing else to say.”</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id="">One can immediately see that there is no specificity to what the accused is saying in the cautioned statement. He does not point to the fact that not drying his hands may have led to contamination. He has not pointed to the fact that he had been told as he alleged to leave a small bottle in the toilet in between the two urine procurement attempts. One would expect the accused for whom this was not the first time he had to provide urine for testing would have mentioned these two points in his cautioned statement, the importance of which is of a very high degree as far as an accused person giving his statement is concerned.</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id="">The other point which the prosecution makes really is that in the case for the defence - and this was in April 2022 which was a date after the cautioned statement was taken - the accused, in effect, is asking to be placed on DRC. I take the prosecution’s point that this suggests very strongly that the accused realised that he had been caught after having consumed methamphetamine and was seeking leniency, so to speak, to be sent to DRC rather than to be sentenced to imprisonment. If he had been innocent, as stated in his cautioned statement, i.e. that he had been clean for 6 years, this would have been strongly put forward in the case for defence. Again, the importance of the case for defence as a document in the procedural process leading up to trial cannot be understated. It would have been obvious to Mr Norasid that if he had a defence, he would have to state this very clearly. Again, no mention of the small bottle being left in the toilet nor the non-drying of the hands.</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id="">As far as these two points that the defence have raised, I would just make these further brief remarks. The defence was asked whether they were going to bring in scientific evidence as to whether not drying hands could lead to contamination. In other words, whether the introduction of water from undried hands - and one must stress these are hands that have been washed - whether the introduction of water to the urine sample may lead to a contamination and a false positive result. Defence had every opportunity to raise scientific expert evidence to show that there was any possibility of contamination but the defence chose not to. There can be only one conclusion as to that and that in this particular case, water contamination, if any, would not have led to any false positive result. In any event, upon consideration of all the evidence, especially that of the escorting officer, I find that Mr Norasid had indeed dried his hands as stated by the escorting officer on both occasions. The other point made by the defence about the leaving of the bottle, as I stated, would have been something so untoward. First, it would not be believable that an officer would actually ask a suspect to leave a bottle as the process would have been compromised should such a direction have been given. Again, in any event, I make a finding that the escorting officer’s evidence was clear in this regard. As I said, if there had been something quite outside the process in that accused was asked to leave a small bottle, escorting officer would have remembered that. In any event, I believe the escorting officer’s evidence that he was the only person escorting Mr Norasid at the material time and that he had not asked Mr Norasid to leave a bottle in the toilet as alleged. Again, one would have to consider the evidence as a whole and there not having been specific references to these two points made by the defence at trial in neither the case for the defence that appears as D1 nor in sorry, case for the defence that appears at P6 nor in the cautioned statement in D1. Upon the consideration of all the defence all the evidence heard before this Court, I find that the prosecution have proven its case against Mr Norasid beyond a reasonable doubt.</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id="">Mr Norasid, you’ve been charged one charge in DAC 904990 of 2021. Pursuant to my finding that the prosecution have proven its case against you beyond a reasonable doubt. I find you guilty of this charge and convict you accordingly.” (End of oral remarks.)</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_49">49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of submission on sentence, it was necessary to consider Norasid’s LT1 and LT2 antecedents. On 14 August 2002, he was sentenced (for an LT1 offence) to imprisonment for a term of five years and nine months, and three strokes of the cane. It is to be noted that this sentence was nine months longer than the mandatory minimum sentence of five years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. On 23 July 2009, Norasid was sentenced (for an LT2 offence) to imprisonment for a term of eight years and six strokes of the cane. It is to be noted that this sentence was one year longer than the mandatory minimum sentence of seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.</a></p><a id="p1_49"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a><a id="p1_50">50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence, in the Mitigation Plea, pointed out that Norasid’s previous LT2 conviction was in 2009. The Defence submitted that for the present conviction, an imprisonment sentence in the range of between seven years and six months and seven years and nine months would be fair (and caning would be mandatory as well). It has to be stressed that this sentence as suggested by the Defence is actually lower than the sentence Norasid previously received for his earlier LT2 offence. Such a sentence would have been inadequate in the circumstances.</a></p><a id="p1_50"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a><a id="p1_51">51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution pointed out that Norasid was a “recalcitrant drug offender” and cited the principle of escalation. The Prosecution sought a sentence of imprisonment for a term of between eight years and six months to nine years, and eight to 10 strokes of the cane.</a></p><a id="p1_51"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a><a id="p1_52">52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noted that this was not Norasid’s first LT2 offence. However, I did take into account that the previous LT2 conviction was in 2009. As Norasid had claimed trial, any discount in sentence for an offender who pleaded guilty could not be granted to Norasid. Taking into account what Norasid had been sentenced to for his previous LT2 conviction, I was of the view that a slight uplift in terms of the imprisonment sentence was appropriate. There was no need, in my view, for an uplift for the caning component of the sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_52"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a><a id="p1_53">53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norasid was thus sentenced to imprisonment for a term of eight years and six months (with effect from 14 March 2021, the date of arrest), and six strokes of the cane. Norasid has appealed against conviction and sentence, and is currently serving sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_53"> </a></div></content></html>
