At the material time of the offences in 2013 to 2014, he was between 15 to 17 years old.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victim is YYY, a 17-year-old female Singaporean, date of birth: XX October 20XX. She is known as “C” to the accused. At the material time of the offences in 2013 to 2014, she was between 7 to 9 years old. The accused is her paternal cousin. The victim’s father is the brother of the accused’s mother.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The informant is ZZZ, a 25-year-old female Singaporean. The accused and victim are her paternal cousins (her father is the brother of the victim’s father and the accused’s mother).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FIRST INFORMATION REPORT</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 23 June 2020, at about 9.33pm, the informant brought the victim to Woodlands West Neighbourhood Police Centre to make a police report. The victim reported that she was molested when she was young.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">III.&nbsp;&nbsp;BACKGROUND FACTS</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Location of the offences</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused resided in Block XXX Woodlands Avenue X #XX-XXX, Singapore (“the accused’s house”) with: a. His father; b. His mother; and c. His sister named W, female, currently 22 years old. She was 12 to 14 years old at the material time.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investigations revealed that between 2013 and 2014, the victim and her brother would occasionally stay over at the accused’s house over the weekend, so that they could ice-skate with W over the weekend.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the same period between 2013 and 2014, the accused’s family (including the accused) also frequently visited his grandfather’s house located at Block XXX Yishun Street XX, #XX-XXX, Singapore (“the grandfather’s house”) when the victim resided there.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 2013 and 2014, the victim had a close relationship with the accused and his family members as she frequently spent time with them during that period.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused’s pornographic habits</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused started watching pornography sometime on or about 2013 (when he was about 15 to 16 years old). As a result of watching pornography, he felt curious about the sexual acts which he watched and thus decided to commit the sexual acts against the victim.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 4th PROCEEDED CHARGE (DAC-906389-2022) – AGGRAVATED OUTRAGE OF MODESTY</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime between 2013 and 2014, the victim, who was about 7 to 9 years old, was in her grandfather’s house. The accused and his family visited the grandfather’s house on that day.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that day, the accused had watched pornography on his mobile phone in his grandfather’s room, and got curious about the sexual acts he watched. At about the same time, the victim entered the room, and the accused thus decided to commit sexual acts on the victim. He told the victim that he wanted to “try something” but did not elaborate on the details. The victim also did not know what he wanted to try.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused then approached the victim and used his hands to touch her breasts over her clothing. The victim was shocked and scared by what he was doing and did not react. The accused observed that the victim did not react to his touching. His hands then went under her clothes, and he touched her breasts (skin-to-skin contact). The victim did not react and continued to let him touch her breasts under her clothes, as she was shocked and scared.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused then decided to touch the victim’s vagina. He used one of his hands to touch her vagina over her clothes, by rubbing her vagina over her clothes. Thereafter, he stuck one of his hands into her shorts and panties, and touched her vagina by rubbing her vagina (skin-to-skin contact).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After touching the victim as described above for about 30 minutes, the accused decided to stop his actions, as he knew that his actions were wrong. He then went out of his grandfather’s room and watched television programmes in the living room.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victim was shocked and scared after the accused molested her, but she did not understand what the accused was doing to her and did not know what to do. As such, she did not react to his actions and did not shout or ask for help. She did not consent to the accused’s actions described in paragraphs [12] to [14] above. She was also too young to consent to his actions, by virtue of s 90(c) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”), as she was under 12 years of age.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused committed the abovementioned acts in paragraphs [12] to [14] by using criminal force, with the intention to outrage the victim’s modesty. The accused knew that due to the victim’s young age at that point of time, she would not have understood what he was doing to her.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence under s 354(1) and punishable under s 354(2) of the PC.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">V.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 3RD PROCEEDED CHARGE (DAC-906388-2022) – AGGRAVATED OUTRAGE OF MODESTY</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime between 2013 and 2014, on a weekend, the victim, who was about 7 to 9 years old, was in the accused’s house. The plan was for her to ice-skate with W (the accused’s sister) over that weekend. On that day, the accused and the victim happened to be the only ones around in the house at the material time, as the rest of the family members were out. At the material time, the victim was sleeping on the mattress in the bedroom of the accused’s parents.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At or about the same time, the accused was watching pornography and got curious about the sexual acts he watched. The accused saw the victim alone in the house and decided to commit sexual acts on the victim.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victim was sleeping on the mattress in the bedroom of the accused’s parents. The accused approached the victim and used his hands to touch her breasts over her clothing. The victim was awakened by his actions and was shocked by what he was doing. However, as she was shocked and scared, she pretended to be asleep. The accused then observed that the victim did not react to his touching. The accused’s hands then went under her clothes, and he touched her breasts (skin-to-skin contact). The victim did not react and continued to let him touch her breasts under her clothes, as she was feeling shocked and scared.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused then decided to touch the victim’s vagina. He used one of his hands to touch her vagina over her clothes, by rubbing her vagina over her clothes. Thereafter, he stuck one of his hands into her shorts and panties, and touched her vagina by rubbing his finger against her vagina (skin-to-skin contact).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After touching the victim as described above for about 30 minutes, the accused got very aroused, and his penis became erect. He partially pulled down his shorts and exposed his bare and erect penis. He also partially pulled down the victim’s shorts and panties and rubbed his penis against her vagina (skin-to-skin contact) for about 5 minutes. He was initially trying to insert his penis into her vagina.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the accused rubbed his penis against the victim’s vagina for about 5 minutes, and after failing to insert his penis, the accused decided to stop his actions, as he felt that his actions were wrong. He pulled up his shorts and helped the victim get dressed. He went to the toilet to take a bath, where he masturbated and ejaculated.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">24.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above incident described in paragraphs [20] to [23] (touching of the victim’s breasts and vagina, and rubbing his penis against her vagina) occurred on a few occasions between 2013 and 2014 in the accused’s house, apart from the abovementioned occasion.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">25.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On all these occasions, the victim was shocked and scared after the accused molested her, but she did not understand what the accused was doing to her and did not know what to do. As such, she did not react to his actions and did not shout or ask for help. She did not consent to the accused’s actions described in paragraphs [20] to [23] above. She was also too young to consent to his actions, by virtue of s 90(c) of the PC, as she was under 12 years of age at all material times between 2013 to 2014.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">26.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused committed the abovementioned acts in paragraphs [20] to [23] by using criminal force, with the intention to outrage the victim’s modesty. The accused knew that due to the victim’s young age at that point of time, she would not have understood what he was doing to her.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">27.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence under s 354(1) and punishable under s 354(2) of the PC.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">VI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DISCOVERY OF THE OFFENCES</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">28.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incidents came to light after the victim attempted to commit suicide (due to a quarrel with her boyfriend which was unrelated to this case) on 11 June 2020 and was admitted to the Institute of Mental Health for treatment. After the suicide attempt, the victim related the incidents to the informant, who then brought the victim to make a police report.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">29.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the sexual assaults committed by the accused against her, she felt emotional, disgusted, hopeless, and unwanted. She also cut herself to manage the difficult emotions she had been feeling.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">30.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused was arrested on 26 June 2020. The following items were seized from him: a. One OPPO mobile phone and SIM card; and b. One iPhone 7 mobile phone and SIM card.”</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">(C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;REASONS FOR THE SENTENCES IMPOSED</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After careful consideration of the written submissions and replies of both parties, I imposed on the AP a sentence of 16 months’ imprisonment and 1 stroke of the cane for the charge in DAC-906389-2022 and a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment and 2 strokes of the cane for the charge in DAC-906388-2022, with both sentences to run consecutively, resulting in a global sentence of 46 months’ imprisonment with 3 strokes of the cane to be imposed on the AP. The reasons I have given to the parties at the time of imposition of the aforesaid sentences on the AP on 9 March 2023 were as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_4"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4"></a><a id=""> <b><em>Probation inappropriate</em></b> </a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_4-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the High Court sentencing considerations in <em>A Karthik v PP </em></a><em><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22640-SSP.xml')">[2018] 5 SLR 1289</a>(“Karthik”)</em> where it was held that primacy of rehabilitation for a youthful offender may be diminished by the circumstances of the case, or eclipsed by considerations of deterrence or retribution in cases where the offence is serious or the harm caused is severe, I took the view that probation will not be appropriate for the AP and it was legally correct for the defence not to submit for rehabilitation to retain primacy and hence for probation for the AP who faced 2 proceeded charges of aggravated outrage of modesty under s 354 PC against a female victim (“V”) aged 7 to 9 years and the AP was about twice the V’s age with skin to skin contact by rubbing his penis against V’s vagina in DAC 906388-2022 and touching the V’s breasts in DAC 906389-2022 plus 3 other similar s 354 PC charges and another charge for possession of obscene films to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rehabilitation is typically a key consideration in sentencing young offenders for two reasons: (i) the retrospective rationale justifies rehabilitation on account of youthful folly and inexperience at the time of the offence; and (ii) the prospective rationale justifies rehabilitation on the grounds of young offenders’ receptiveness to rehabilitation, the benefit to society from rehabilitating young offenders who have constructive years ahead of them, as well as the disproportionate suffering endured by young offenders as compared to an adult offender when exposed to punitive options (<em>Karthik at [37]</em>). In cases where an offender was below 21 years old at the time of the offence, but above that age by sentencing, the prospective rationale would no longer apply strongly (if at all), while the retrospective rational remains relevant (<em>Karthik at [45]</em>). In determining whether rehabilitation is still relevant, the court should consider the circumstances of the case, including: (i) whether there was undue delay in prosecution which prejudiced the offender; and (ii) whether there was evidence of rehabilitative progress in the intervening period (<em>Karthik at [49] and [58]</em>).</a></p><a id="p1_4-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_4-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rejected the defence submissions and agreed with the prosecution that in the present case, while the prospective rationale did not apply strongly and the retrospective rationale might apply to some degree as the AP was 15-17 years old at the time of committing the offences, rehabilitation was overshadowed by deterrence and retribution, for two key reasons:</a></p><a id="p1_4-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_4-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_4-p2_c-p3_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prospective rationale did not apply strongly as the AP is now 26 years old, and there was no undue delay in prosecuting him upon receipt of V’s First Information Report. While V only reported the matter about 6 years after the sexual abuse, the AP should not be given a sentencing discount purely on this basis, and V cannot be faulted for the late report, as she was young and did not know how to react then (being only 7-9 years old at the material time). The AP had also admitted to knowing that “due to V’s young age at that point of time, she would not have understood what he was doing to her” (SOF at [16] and [26]).
