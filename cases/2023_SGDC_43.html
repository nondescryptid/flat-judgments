The defendant is the owner of a prime mover that was travelling in front of the plaintiff’s motorcycle at the material time. The accident happened on the Pan Island Expressway (“PIE”) towards Changi Airport after the Bukit Batok and Ayer Rajah Expressway exit.</a></p><a id="p1_1"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts of the accident are relatively straightforward. On 8 June 2018 at about 11.30pm, the plaintiff was riding his motorcycle along the extreme right lane (“Lane 1”) of the PIE. The defendant’s vehicle driven by its authorised driver was transporting what was described as a “40-foot (High Cube) container” had swerved from Lane 2 onto Lane 1. The top of the defendant’s vehicle then hit an overhanging tree branch causing it to fall on the expressway and across the path of travel in front of the plaintiff’s motorcycle.</a></p><a id="p1_2"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff’s motorcycle could not stop in time. It collided into the fallen tree branch causing the plaintiff to be thrown off his motorcycle. He sustained serious injuries from the impact of the fall, including a momentary loss of consciousness, and had to be conveyed to a hospital. His motorcycle was also damaged.</a></p><a id="p1_3"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff brought this action claiming damages against the defendant on the basis that the accident was caused solely, or contributed to, by the negligence of its driver in the driving, management and control of the defendant’s vehicle. The trial on the issue of liability proceeded before me with three witnesses – the plaintiff, the defendant’s driver and a motorist who had witnessed the accident.</a></p><a id="p1_4"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the trial, I had reserved judgment to consider the evidence. Subsequently, I made the finding that the defendant’s driver was substantially at fault for causing the accident and apportioned liability at 90:10 in the plaintiff’s favour. The defendant, being dissatisfied, has appealed to the High Court and I set out herein the grounds of my decision.</a></p><a id="p1_5"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s case</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff’s case was essentially that the defendant’s driver, one Allafa bin Abdullah formerly known as Gan Chun Hin (“DW1”), was negligent as he had failed to take notice of his surroundings in particular the height and positioning of the overhanging tree branches. He had caused the defendant’s vehicle to collide into the branches, causing the branches to fall and had thereby created a dangerous situation to other road users such as the plaintiff.</a></p><a id="p1_6"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff contended that DW1 was 100% at fault.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defendant’s case</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendant’s case was that DW1 was driving straight on Lane 1 of the PIE when the top of its vehicle had brushed against the overhanging tree branches along the PIE.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendant’s contention was that DW1 should not be found negligent as he was driving “normally and in the ordinary course” along the PIE. The defendant had further contended that the plaintiff ought to have brought proceedings against the entity responsible for maintaining the trees along the PIE for <em>inter alia</em> allowing the trees to be overgrown and/or too low hanging.</a></p><a id="p1_9"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the cases presented by both parties, the main issue that the court had to determine was whether there was any negligence on the part of the defendant’s driver in causing the tree branches to fall on Lane 1 of the PIE thereby creating a dangerous situation which the plaintiff could not avoid. If the defendant’s driver were found negligent, the subsidiary issue was whether there was any contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether DW1 was negligent in causing the tree branches to fall </p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The plaintiff’s evidence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notably, the plaintiff had in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) (in line with his original pleaded case) stated that the defendant’s vehicle, which he described as a trailer, had swerved onto Lane 1, collided into the centre divider and crashed into a tree causing it to fall and the plaintiff to subsequently collide into the tree branches<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a>. This version was abandoned at the trial. The plaintiff explained during his cross-examination that he had suffered memory loss as a result of the accident and had only a hazy recollection of what had happened. This was likely due to him having suffered a subdural haematoma from the accident as documented in his medical records<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his oral testimony, the plaintiff testified that he was travelling on Lane 1 at a speed of 90 to 100 kph at the material time<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a>. The defendant’s vehicle was ahead of his motorcycle about one to two car lengths away when it swerved from Lane 2 to Lane 1. From the plaintiff’s perspective, the defendant’s vehicle was travelling faster than the speed of his motorcycle as it had overtaken him<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. When the tree branch fell, he could not avoid colliding into it as it was quite a large branch and had straddled the road in front of his motorcycle<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff placed substantial reliance on the evidence of one Mohammad Fadli bin Ibrahim (“PW2”) who was regarded as an independent witness.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW2 had filed a police report which described the accident as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_14"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">On 8<sup>th</sup> of June 2018 at about 2335hrs i was driving along the PIE toward the city area. During that timing, a distance away i saw there’s an heavy vehicle escort on the extreme left lane which takes up two lanes (Heavy vehicle on one lane &amp; the escort on the other lane). As usual most the vehicle in front start to overtake by changing to the right lane and at this point of time I saw that a Malaysian registered trailer is also doing his overtaking by changing lane. But to my surprised he drove to the extreme right lane (lane 1) and not long after the trailer enter the lane, i saw the leaves and branches of the tree come raining down to the road. I believe the trailer height is much higher than the branches of the trees along the expressway.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">At this moment there is a few motorbikes and vehicle is behind the trailer and that is where an accident happen between 2 motorcyclist collided with the fallen tree branches where they unable to react instantly to the split seconds incident. I was shocked when I drove pass by on the 3<sup>rd</sup> lane of the PIE. The trailer did not stop and one of the escort officer gave a chase to the trailer and I stop my car at the road shoulder and render my help to the injured motorcyclist.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his AEIC, PW2 essentially reiterated the same account. He saw the defendant’s trailer switch lanes from Lane 2 to Lane 1. He saw the defendant’s trailer hit some tree branches which caused the tree branches to fall on the expressway, and due to the falling tree branches, two motorcyclists fell to the ground<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During cross-examination, PW2 confirmed that he was driving on Lane 2 of the PIE at the material time<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a>. The defendant’s vehicle was travelling ahead of him. From a distance away, PW2 saw a heavy vehicle accompanied by an escort vehicle which took up the two lanes on the left of the PIE, namely Lane 3 and Lane 4<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. The vehicles in front changed lanes to overtake the heavy vehicle and the escort vehicle. PW2 saw the defendant’s trailer which was ahead of him by one to two other vehicles<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>. He saw the defendant’s trailer changing lanes from Lane 3. Instead of staying on Lane 2, the defendant’s vehicle went onto Lane 1. Shortly after, which PW2 described as “split second” and “less than a minute”, he saw the tree branches fall on the road leading to the collision by two motorcycles, one of which was the plaintiff’s. He then stopped his car on the road shoulder to render assistance to the injured motorcyclists.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The defendant’s evidence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his AEIC, DW1 recounted that on the night of 8 June 2018, he was driving the defendant’s prime mover mounted with a 40-foot High Cube container loaded with goods. He had started his journey from Johor, Malaysia and was proceeding to Singapore’s Changi Airport. At about 11.30pm, he was driving the defendant’s vehicle on Lane 1 of the PIE when he suddenly heard a noise from the top of the prime mover. He then brought his vehicle to a stop on the shoulder lane and alighted to check what had hit onto the top of his vehicle. He noticed a slight dent on the front top part of the High Cube container<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly thereafter, an officer from the Land Transport Authority (“LTA”) approached him and informed him that his prime mover had hit a tree branch overhanging the expressway and caused it to fall. He was further informed of the motorcyclist that had hit the fallen tree branches and fallen onto the expressway. He was instructed to remain inside his vehicle until further notice from the LTA officer<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, he was notified that the defendant’s vehicle would be towed to a nearby carpark and that he would be escorted to the Traffic Police headquarters.

When he saw the heavy vehicle and the escort vehicle (which he referred to as “LTA” in his oral testimony), he then changed lanes from Lane 4 to Lane 3 then Lane 2 and Lane 1. He explained that he went into Lane 1 to avoid the heavy vehicle and escort vehicle on the left<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>. When he was on Lane 1, he suddenly felt a vibration and he then stopped his vehicle to check. That was when he found out from an LTA officer that his vehicle had hit the tree branches which caused the accident to the motorcyclists<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DW1 asserted in his AEIC that he was not at fault for the accident as the defendant’s vehicle did not violate any height requirements for travelling on the roads in Singapore. No action had been taken by the Traffic Police against him or the defendant for the accident<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a>, and the same vehicle was still being driven on Singapore roads<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>. He further asserted that it was the plaintiff who had failed to keep a proper lookout and had travelled a fast speed such that he was unable to stop in time to avoid colliding into the fallen tree branch<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">My finding</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW2 had a given a clear and consistent narrative of the accident. His evidence was unchallenged. His was an independent eye-witness account of what had actually taken place. I accepted his testimony and made the finding that the defendant’s vehicle had hit the overhanging tree branches and caused the branches to fall onto Lane 1 of the PIE. The fallen tree branches had created a hazard on the road. The plaintiff’s motorcycle travelling on Lane 1 had collided into the fallen tree branches causing him to fall and sustain injuries.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When questioned on the condition of the road at the material time, PW2 testified that traffic was not very congested, and vehicles could proceed straight on Lane 2<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a>. The fact that vehicles had a clear passage on Lane 2 at the material time would explain why he had expressed surprise to see the defendant’s vehicle enter Lane 1 instead of remaining on Lane 2 as recorded in PW2’s police report.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW2’s evidence was also consistent with the plaintiff’s testimony that the defendant’s vehicle had swerved into his lane and overtaken him on lane 1. Based on the plaintiff’s testimony that his speed at the material time was 90 to 100 kph and DW1’s evidence that he had felt a vibration which caused him to stop and check, it was reasonable to infer, and it was my finding, that the defendant’s vehicle had been driven at an excessive speed when it collided into the overhanging branches. There must have been a considerable force exerted in the collision or contact between the top of the defendant’s vehicle with the overhanging tree branch thereby causing it to fall. The impact between the tree branch and the top portion of the defendant’s vehicle had in turn caused the vibration felt by DW1 inside the vehicle.</a></p><a id="p1_25"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large vehicles such as the defendant’s prime mover carrying a 40-foot High Cube container are not meant to be driven on the extreme right lane or Lane 1 of the PIE. They are also not allowed to be driven at a speed of 90kph notwithstanding that 90kph is the speed limit on the PIE. See the standards as prescribed by paragraph 101 of the Highway Code:</a></p><a id="p1_26"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Drivers of large vehicles must always —</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keep such vehicles to the road or vehicle speed limit (whichever is lower); and;</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;travel on the extreme left lane of the road (except for bus lanes during their operating hours) to allow faster vehicles to overtake on the right.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As can be seen in the photograph attached to DW1’s AEIC (see BAEIC page 50), the maximum allowable speed for the defendant’s prime mover is 70kph.</a></p><a id="p1_27"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had accepted PW2’s evidence and found that Lane 2 was clear for vehicles, including the defendant’s vehicle, to proceed straight. If DW1 had kept to a safe speed for his vehicle and travelled on Lane 2, the top of the vehicle (including the High Cube container) would not have collided into the overhanging tree branches on Lane 1 causing them to fall. Instead, DW1 had in my assessment driven negligently in swerving the vehicle to Lane 1 at an unsafe speed and colliding into the overhanging branches. If DW1 had kept to a safe speed, he would have been able to manoeuvre the vehicle safely onto Lane 2 without colliding into the overhanging branches.</a></p><a id="p1_28"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, I had found the defendant’s driver, DW1, negligent in<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a>:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;driving at a speed which was excessive in the circumstances;</a></p><a id="p1_29-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_29-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;failing to pay any or sufficient heed to the presence of the plaintiff’s motorcycle;</a></p><a id="p1_29-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_29-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;driving otherwise than in an orderly and careful manner having regard to other road users and the condition of the road which would include the overhanging tree branches at the material time; and</a></p><a id="p1_29-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_29-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;colliding into the tree branches causing them to fall.</a></p><a id="p1_29-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DW1’s negligence had caused the branches to fall on the road creating a dangerous situation for the plaintiff who was unable to avoid colliding into the fallen branches. As he was admitted to be the defendant’s authorised driver, the defendant was accordingly liable.</a></p><a id="p1_30"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the defendant’s contention that DW1 could not be negligent since the vehicle was being driven in the “normal and ordinary course” given that the Traffic Police had not taken any action against them, the fact that no prosecution had been instituted was not a good indicator of whether DW1 had breached his duty of care towards the plaintiff as a fellow road user taking into account the road condition at the material time.</a></p><a id="p1_31"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendant had further contended that if any liability were to be imposed on any party, it should be the entity that had failed to prune the tree branches, presumably National Parks Board. I did not accept this argument. While that entity might have been in breach of its duty of care, it was incumbent on the defendant, had it thought fit, to commence third party proceedings against that entity. Notably, the record shows that the defendant had applied for, and was granted, leave for such third party proceedings but did not prosecute them any further for reasons not disclosed to the court.</a></p><a id="p1_32"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the plaintiff was contributorily negligent</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counsel for the defendant, Mr Lennon Wu, had submitted that if the defendant were found negligent, the liability should nonetheless be apportioned at 50:50 primarily because the plaintiff had been riding his motorcycle at an excessive speed of 90 to 100kph<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a>.

He did concede, however, that if the court found that the plaintiff had travelled in excess of the speed limit, there should be some contributory negligence, albeit minimal at 10%.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that the defendant’s vehicle was travelling at least two car lengths ahead of the plaintiff’s motorcycle, I accepted that if the plaintiff had been riding well within the PIE speed limit at the material time, that would have afforded him a longer reaction time to the danger ahead of him so as to take some form of evasive action. The plaintiff was a forthright witness and testified that he was going at about 90 to 100 kph at the material time<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a>.
