While these consent orders may evidence a contractual agreement, it does not follow as a matter of course that they will be rigidly enforced against a party in breach to the exclusion of the court’s ability to prevent injustice within the litigation process. Much will depend on the subject matter of the compromise, and whether the consent order is procedural or substantive in nature. Where procedural consent orders (such as consent unless orders) are concerned, the court retains a residual discretion not to enforce the order against the defaulting party in the absence of a high degree of intentionally contumacious or contumelious conduct.</a></p><a id="p1_1"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case before me concerns an application by the Defendant, PT Super Sistem Ultima, to seek an extension of time to comply with the terms of a consent order recorded pursuant to an agreement with the Plaintiff, Super Sea Cable Networks Pte Ltd. At the conclusion of the hearing, I found the order in question to be a consent unless order and/or procedural consent order. I also considered it appropriate to exercise the court’s residual discretion not to enforce the order against the Defendant, after taking into account the nature and degree of default as well as the overall circumstances of the case.</a></p><a id="p1_2"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there was eventually no appeal against the decision, the case itself presented an opportunity for the court to take a closer look at the distinction between a procedural consent order and a substantive consent order. For this reason, I set out below the full grounds of my decision.</a></p><a id="p1_3"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The background to this case is relatively straightforward. On 27 July 2022, the Plaintiff filed DC/SUM 2488/2022 (“SUM 2488”), an application for security for costs in the Defendant’s counterclaim. Thereafter, the parties embarked on negotiations concerning SUM 2488. Parties eventually came to an agreement on SUM 2488 and the wording of the order to be recorded before the court.</a></p><a id="p1_4"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 24 August 2022, parties sent a joint letter to the court, informing that parties have reached an amicable resolution in relation to SUM 2488 and wished to record a consent order. On the same day, the court recorded DC/ORC 2461/2022 (“the Consent Order”) whereby it was ordered that:</a></p><a id="p1_5"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant, which is the Plaintiff in the counterclaim, does furnish security for the Plaintiff's, which is the Defendant in the counterclaim, costs up to the conclusion of general discovery in the sum of SGD 20,000 (the "Security").</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Security be furnished by the Defendant within 7 days from the date of the order by way of a solicitors' undertaking (on the wording as agreed between the parties as set out in the Annex), failing which the Defendant's action in the counterclaim does stand dismissed forthwith with costs, without further order.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any and all further steps and/or proceedings in the counterclaim be stayed until the provision of the Security by the Defendant.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff be at liberty to apply for additional security.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties are to bear their own costs.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to paragraph 2 of the Consent Order, the deadline for the Defendant to provide the security by way of a solicitors’ undertaking was 2 September 2022. However, by 2 September 2022, the Defendant failed to provide the required undertaking.</a></p><a id="p1_6"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 7 September 2022, the Plaintiff’s solicitors wrote to the Defendant’s solicitors, JLim Law Corporation, informing that the Plaintiff had not been served with the required undertaking. Thus, pursuant to paragraph 2 of the Consent Order, the Defendant’s counterclaim was dismissed forthwith with costs without further order. The Plaintiff proposed a sum of S$25,000 (inclusive of disbursements) as costs payable to the Plaintiff.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant’s solicitors responded to the Plaintiff’s letter on the same day explaining that due to an administrative oversight, they had inadvertently missed the deadline to furnish the undertaking. The Defendant’s solicitors sincerely apologised for the oversight, and enclosed the said undertaking in their reply letter. Further, they asserted that the Defendant’s counterclaim stands as pleaded and not dismissed.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 8 September 2022, the Plaintiff’s solicitors wrote to the Defendant’s solicitors and rejected the Defendant’s position. Among other things, the Plaintiff maintained that the counterclaim was dismissed. The Plaintiff highlighted, <em>inter alia</em>, that the Defendant was acutely alive, and had agreed, to such a consequence after having negotiated the wording of the Consent Order and voluntarily entering into the same.</a></p><a id="p1_9"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, on 26 September 2022, the Defendant took out the present summons application to seek an extension of time of up to 7 September 2022 for the Defendant to comply with paragraph 2 of the Consent Order.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues to be determined</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the facts and the parties’ submissions, there are to my mind two principal issues to be addressed:</a></p><a id="p1_11"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_11-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the court in the present case have a residual discretion not to enforce the Consent Order?</a></p><a id="p1_11-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_11-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If so, should the court exercise its residual discretion not to enforce the Consent Order and allow an extension of time?</a></p><a id="p1_11-p2_b"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the court has a residual discretion not to enforce the Consent Order</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I first begin with <em>Wellmix Organics (International) Pte Ltd v Lau Yu Man</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2006] 2 SLR(R) 0117.xml')">[2006] 2 SLR(R) 117</a> (“<em>Wellmix Organics</em>”) where the High Court expressed the view that courts have a residual discretion not to enforce a consent unless order in certain special circumstances where it would be unjust for the party in whose favour the consent order operates to insist on its enforcement in the absence of a high degree of intentionally contumacious or contumelious conduct (at [89] to [90]):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">89&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would be prepared to accept that, the objections in the preceding paragraphs notwithstanding, it would still be desirable to allocate to the court a residuary discretion of the type suggested by Lord Denning MR in <em>Purcell</em>. In this regard, I also respectfully differ from the view preferred by Lee JC in the <em>Wiltopps</em> case, and I do so for the following main reason.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be borne in mind that a consent unless order, whilst technically a contract between the parties, is one that allows one party to wholly deprive the other of its legal rights in the context of litigation. Even though such an order has been agreed upon between the parties, there may, in my view, arise certain special circumstances where it would nevertheless be unjust for the party in whose favour the consent order operates to insist on its enforcement in the absence of a high degree of intentionally contumacious or contumelious conduct.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This residual discretion is an aspect of the court’s inherent powers under O 92 r 4 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC 2014”) to have ultimate control over its own procedure. Bearing in mind that an unless order (whether by consent or otherwise) is part of the procedural armoury and deals in the final analysis with the litigation process, Andrew Phang J (as he then was) held that courts ought to have the final say (at [91] to [92]):</a></p><a id="p1_13"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">91&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a discretion is, in the final analysis, merely an aspect of the court’s power to have ultimate control over its own procedure. This is not at all unreasonable, in my view, and does, on balance, conduce to justice and fairness. The focus is still on procedure, rather than substance. It might be argued that the substantive rights of the plaintiff would be adversely affected. This is arguably the case but it must never be forgotten that an unless order is part of the procedural armoury and is not based on the substantive merits of the case as such. Thus, an unless order (whether by consent or otherwise) deals, in the final analysis, with the <em>litigation process and, on this score, the courts ought to have the final say</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">92&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also imperative to note that the retention of such a discretion is wholly consistent with the <em>raison d’etre</em> of O 92 r 4…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(Emphasis in italics in original)</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Turf Club Auto Emporium Pte Ltd and others v Yeo Boong Hua and others</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20599-SSP.xml')">[2017] 2 SLR 12</a> (“<em>Turf Club Auto</em>”), the Court of Appeal agreed with the above analysis in <em>Wellmix Organics</em> and held that in so far as unless orders made by consent are concerned, the court retains a residual discretion not to enforce the order (at [163]). This is because an unless order is primarily concerned with the court’s procedure, and yet it may bring with it draconian consequences affecting the substantive rights of the parties.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a difference is drawn between a consent unless order and a contractual consent order. <em>Turf Club Auto</em> emphasised that the court’s residual discretion does not extend to contractual consent orders that relate to the substantive issues in the case and the substantive rights of the parties (at [159]). Specifically, there is no conceptual basis for extending such a discretion to a contractual consent order that encapsulates a settlement agreement covering the substantive causes of action between the parties (at [163]).</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal also remarked that there should be no reason to distinguish between a consensual unless order and other procedural orders reached by consent (at [164]). In so far as the latter category of consent orders are concerned, they are concerned purely with the procedures of the court and not with the substantive rights of the parties. Accordingly, the court should retain the same discretion in respect of these procedural orders.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next is the case of <em>Sumber Indah Pte Ltd v Kamala Jewellers Pte Ltd</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21581-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGHC 70</a> (“<em>Sumber Indah</em>”). There, the High Court was faced with a consent order the material terms of which are set out in Annex A of the consent order and reproduced as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant shall pay the Plaintiff the sum of S$100,000 out of the option fee of S$500,000 under Option to Purchase dated 23 August 2016, and the sum of S$5,000 for legal fees and disbursements by 15 September 2017.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant shall pay the Plaintiff the remaining option fee of S$400,000 in equal monthly instalments of S$100,000 each, payable on the 15 day of each month commencing on 15 October 2017.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of any default by the Defendant of any payment stated in Orders 1 and 2 above, the Defendant shall complete the sale of the property at 101/101A Serangoon Road, Singapore 218006 (“Property ”) to the Plaintiff within 21 days of such default.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the Defendant’s repayment of the option fee of S$500,000 and legal fees and disbursements of S$5,000, the parties agree that the Plaintiff’s option to purchase the Property dated 23 August 2016 is rescinded and aborted by mutual consent…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the fulfilment of the above orders, the Plaintiff and the Defendant shall have no further claims against each other arising out of or in connection with the Property and would have reached full and final settlement.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the terms of the consent order, the defendant duly made payment of the $5,000 in legal fees and disbursements, as well as the first two instalments of $100,000 each by the stipulated dates (i.e. 15 September 2017 and 15 October 2017). However, the defendant failed to make subsequent instalment payments on time, and the plaintiff eventually refused to provide an extension of time. The defendant then filed a summons for leave to make payment for one of the missed instalment and an extension of time for the payment of the final instalment. The High Court thus had to consider whether it could allow a unilateral variation of the terms of the consent order agreed upon by parties.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reviewing the authority in <em>Turf Club Auto</em>, Tan Siong Thye J observed the distinction between procedural consent orders and substantive consent orders (at [46]). Whereas procedural consent orders deal with the procedural rights of the parties in the litigation process, substantive consent orders represent a compromise of the parties’ substantive rights in the underlying suit:</a></p><a id="p1_19"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal, in reaching its conclusion, refined the existing legal principles relating to the court’s powers vis-à-vis consent orders, by emphasising the distinction between <em>procedural</em> consent orders and <em>substantive</em> consent orders. By way of definition, <em>procedural</em> or “<em>unless</em>” orders are orders that deal with the procedural rights of the parties in the litigation process. For example, an order for a certain document to be filed by a specific date, failing which the claim will be struck out. <em>Substantive</em> consent orders, on the other hand, represent a compromise of the parties’ substantive rights in the underlying suit.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(Emphasis in italics in original)</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will return to the facts of <em>Turf Club Auto</em> and <em>Sumber Indah</em> again when considering the distinguishing features or factors between procedural consent orders and substantive consent orders. For now, it suffices to note that the consent orders in <em>Turf Club Auto</em> and <em>Sumber Indah</em> were held to be substantive consent orders.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Procedural consent order versus substantive consent order</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distinction between a procedural consent order and a substantive consent order formed the gravamen of the dispute before me, with parties’ submissions diverging sharply on the characterisation of the Consent Order. Mr Darrell Low, instructed counsel for the Defendant, contended that the Consent Order is a procedural consent order, and therefore the court retains a residual discretion not to enforce the order. Mr Low also relied on O 3 r 4 ROC 2014 for an extension of time of a few days to regularise the solicitors’ undertaking provided by the Defendant’s solicitors on 7 September 2022.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, counsel for the Plaintiff, Mr Sim Chong, submitted that the Consent Order is a contractual consent order, and the court has no residual discretion to vary or not enforce in the absence of any vitiating factors. In this case, the Defendant did not assert any vitiating factor, and therefore the Court should uphold the sanctity of the contract by dismissing the Defendant’s application.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a> In his written submissions, Mr Sim relied on the following points:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, parties had negotiated and arrived at a settlement in relation to SUM 2488.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, in entering into the Consent Order, the Plaintiff agreed to a compromised sum of S$20,000 and by way of a solicitors’ undertaking as security for its costs in consideration for it withdrawing SUM 2488 with no order as to costs. There was consideration flowing both ways between parties. Like those in <em>Sumber Indah</em>, parties had willingly entered into a contract or a settlement agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the deadline for the Defendant to furnish the solicitors’ undertaking was expressly spelt out. Parties clearly envisaged such a deadline to be strictly and rigidly adhered to, particularly given the consequence of the Defendant’s counterclaim being struck out immediately without further order should there be a breach of the said deadline. This was the same situation in <em>Sumber Indah</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, similar to the case in <em>Sumber Indah</em>, the settlement agreement was recorded as an order of court at the request and agreement of the parties.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a> In a reply from the court to a request for pre-trial conference, the court has recognised the Consent Order as a contractual consent order “agreed between the parties” and was going to hold the parties to their contractual bargain.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the last point, I disagree that there was recognition or acknowledgment by the court that the Consent Order is a contractual consent order. To provide some background, following the Defendant’s breach of the Consent Order, the Plaintiff’s solicitors wrote to the court by way of a letter dated 14 September 2022 to request for a pre-trial conference to be held so that parties can take directions on, <em>inter alia</em>, the costs payable by the Defendant in relation to the dismissal of the counterclaim and the next steps for the matter (“the PTC Request”). The PTC Request was refused with the following remarks by the court (“the Court’s Reply”):</a></p><a id="p1_23"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The consent order has already been recorded with the term "the Defendant's action in the counterclaim does stand dismissed forthwith with costs, without further order" which was agreed between the parties. The parties did not agreed for costs of the counterclaim to be fixed by the court. If parties are unable to agree on the costs payable pursuant to paragraph 2 of the consent order, the party who claims to be entitled to costs of the counterclaim should apply for his costs to be taxed pursuant to Order 59 and not request for a PTC for fixing of costs of the proceedings.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the Court’s Reply merely reiterates that there was no agreement for costs of the counterclaim to be fixed by the court. If parties are unable to agree on costs payable pursuant to paragraph 2 of the Consent Order, then costs should be taxed. Significantly, the Court’s Reply says nothing about whether the Consent Order is a procedural or substantive one. Neither was the PTC Request targeted at asking the court to make any such distinction. In the premises, I fail to see how the Court’s Reply could meaningfully aid in the Plaintiff’s interpretation that the Consent Order should be a contractual or substantive consent order.</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key thrust of the Plaintiff’s arguments centred on the fact that parties had gone through an elaborate bargaining process before arriving at a compromised sum for the security and an agreement in respect of the Consent Order. At the hearing, Mr Sim brought me through the chain of correspondences between parties’ solicitors to demonstrate that the Defendant’s solicitors had went to great lengths in negotiating the specific wording of the Consent Order. Mr Low countered that the court should not be looking at the number of correspondences or letters exchanged, but rather the nature of the consent order that was breached. I agree with Mr Low.</a></p><a id="p1_25"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focusing on the bargaining or negotiation process is scarcely illuminating when one bears in mind that the discretion not to enforce a consent order is rooted in the court’s overriding control over its own procedure. <em>Wellmix Organics</em> explained that this discretion could arise even though a consent unless order is “technically a contract between the parties” (at [90]). That is to say, despite the otherwise “impeccable legal status of a consent unless order” (at [100]) and “even an agreement entered into by [the parties]” (at [102]), the courts ought to be allowed to do justice between them in limited situations. Therefore, the court’s residual discretion may exist <em>notwithstanding</em> the contractual aspect of parties’ agreement or consent.</a></p><a id="p1_26"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How then should a procedural consent order be distinguished from a substantive consent order (or a contractual consent order)? As shown from the case authorities, a key consideration lies not in <em>how</em> the parties arrived at an agreement, but <em>what</em> the parties agreed on, having particular regard to the nature of the rights and obligations sought to be compromised in the consent order.</a></p><a id="p1_27"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the facts of <em>Sumber Indah</em>, Tan J held that the consent order was a substantive consent order as it was recorded pursuant to a settlement agreement between the parties which was intended to determine with finality the substantive rights and obligations of the parties (at [50]). The intention of the parties was evidenced by condition 9 in Annex A of the consent order which states that “[f]ollowing the fulfilment of the above orders…[the parties]…would have reached <em>full and final settlement</em>” (emphasis in italics in original). Therefore, Tan J came to the conclusion that the court should not have a residual discretion in varying such substantive consent orders.</a></p><a id="p1_28"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In arriving at his decision, Tan J also referred to the case of <em>CSR South East Asia Pte Ltd (formerly known as CSR Bradford Insulation (S) Pte Ltd) v Sunrise Insulation Pte Ltd</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2002] 1 SLR(R) 1079.xml')">[2002] 1 SLR(R) 1079</a> (“<em>CSR South East Asia</em>”). The consent order in <em>CSR South East Asia</em> was recorded after the plaintiffs and defendants arrived at a negotiated settlement in relation to their claim and counterclaim in the suit. The terms of the consent order recorded by the court are as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Defendants to pay the Plaintiffs the sum of $21,718.92 in 4 equal instalments of S$5,429.73 each commencing on the 30th day of June 2001 and thereafter on the 30th day of each succeeding month;</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each party to bear [its] own costs;</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Notice of Discontinuance for the Plaintiffs and the Defendants to be filed within 14 days from the date of the last payment;</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the event of default in any of the instalment payment on the part of the Defendants, the Plaintiffs shall be at liberty to enter Judgment on the Plaintiffs’ claimed sum of S$36,343.92 less any payments received from the Defendants together with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of Writ of Summons to the date of Judgment, costs to be agreed or taxed and the Defendants’ counterclaim shall be deemed to be withdrawn.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendants paid the first three instalment payments in compliance with the terms of the consent order, but defaulted on the last instalment which was due on 1 October 2001. A cheque drawn by the defendants dated 29 September 2001 was reportedly mailed to the plaintiffs at about 6.30PM on 1 October 2001 and received by the plaintiffs only on 3 October 2001. The plaintiffs deemed the late arrival of the cheque to be in breach of the consent order, and entered judgment against the defendants. The defendants applied to set aside the judgment but were unsuccessful before the deputy registrar and the district judge.</a></p><a id="p1_30"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the High Court, the defendants argued that the mailing of the cheque by the defendants on 1 October 2001 should have been sufficient compliance with the consent order. MPH Rubin J held (at [12]) that the consent order evidenced a contract between the parties and there was no justification to vary or modify the said order without the consent of both the parties. Given this conclusion, Rubin J effectively considered the consent order to be a substantive consent order (see <em>Sumber Indah</em> at [53]).</a></p><a id="p1_31"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is apposite at this juncture to return to the contractual consent order in <em>Turf Club Auto</em>. In that case, the consent order unequivocally and immediately compromised the parties’ consolidated suits (at [155]). The original causes of action in the consolidated suits were superseded upon the making of the consent order, and the original claims discharged by the consent order (at [156]). For reference, Clause 1 of the consent order states that “[t]he terms of this Order shall constitute a <em>full and final settlement of all claims</em> that the [Respondents] may have against [the Defendants (Consolidated Suits)], howsoever arising out of or in relation to the [Consolidated Suits]” (emphasis in italics added).</a></p><a id="p1_32"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summarising the case authorities above, a consent order falls to be construed as a contractual or substantive consent order when it is recorded pursuant to an agreement by parties to determine or compromise with finality their substantive rights and obligations in the underlying suit (<em>Sumber Indah</em>). This could be so where parties agree for the terms of the consent order or the fulfilment of the same to constitute a full and final settlement of the parties’ respective claims in the suit (<em>CSR South East Asia</em>, <em>Sumber Indah</em>, <em>Turf Club Auto</em>), or where the consent order represents a settlement agreement which covers the substantive causes of action or supersedes the original causes of action between the parties in the suit (<em>Turf Club Auto</em>).</a></p><a id="p1_33"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pause here to caveat that these features do not purport to be exhaustive, and contractual or substantive consent orders may not necessarily be confined only to those which contain the descriptions as summarised. However, in so far as the case authorities seem to suggest that these factors are relevant, if not weighty in the identification of a substantive consent order, I will proceed on this basis to ascertain the nature and character of the Consent Order in the present case.</a></p><a id="p1_34"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Nature and characterisation of the Consent Order </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To recapitulate, the material terms of the Consent Order are as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_35"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35"></a><a id="p1_35-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 1 orders the Defendant (being the plaintiff in the counterclaim) to furnish security for the Plaintiff’s (being the defendant in the counterclaim) costs up to the conclusion of general discovery in the sum of S$20,000.</a></p><a id="p1_35-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_35-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 2 orders the security to be furnished by the Defendant within seven days from the date of the order by way of a solicitors’ undertaking based on the wording as agreed between the parties, failing which the Defendant’s action in the counterclaim does stand dismissed forthwith with costs, without further order.</a></p><a id="p1_35-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_35-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 3 orders all further steps and/or proceedings in the counterclaim to be stayed until the provision of the Security by the Defendant.</a></p><a id="p1_35-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my judgment, the Consent Order should be properly construed as a consent unless order and/or a procedural consent order for which the court retains a residual discretion not to enforce. I make three points in support of this conclusion.</a></p><a id="p1_36"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Consent Order is an order directing that a specified consequence will be imposed unless the party concerned complies with the terms by a given deadline. In this case, if the Defendant fails to furnish the security within seven days from the date of the order, the Defendant’s counterclaim faces the severe sanction of being dismissed forthwith with costs and without further order. Parties in this case do not dispute, and it may be assessed on a clear objective basis, that there was an agreement on the terms of the order. Therefore, the Consent Order could be construed as a consent unless order in respect of which the court would squarely retain the residual discretion not to enforce (<em>Turf Club Auto</em> at [163]).</a></p><a id="p1_37"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Consent Order was recorded pursuant to parties’ agreement in relation to SUM 2488, the Plaintiff’s application for security for costs. Generally, the aim of obtaining such a security is to protect a defendant from the risk of not being able to recover costs against the plaintiff even if the defendant eventually prevails in defending the claim. Here, the Consent Order protects the Plaintiff by ordering that a solicitors’ undertaking be furnished, with all further steps and/or proceedings in the Defendant’s counterclaim to be stayed until the provision of the security. On these terms, the Consent Order functions in the main as a procedural mechanism or means by which the Plaintiff obtains security.</a></p><a id="p1_38"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foregoing analysis does not change even if parties had clearly envisaged the severe consequence of the Defendant’s counterclaim being struck out.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a> As I explained in my brief oral grounds, a consent order does not become substantive in nature simply because substantive consequences have been contemplated by or agreed upon between parties. If it were otherwise, then most (if not all) consent unless orders would be substantive <em>per se</em>, since unless orders (whether by consent or otherwise) invariably provide for severe and substantive sanctions upon a failure to comply.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, there was no agreement for a full and final settlement of the parties’ respective claims. Neither was the Consent Order intended to compromise with any measure of finality the parties’ substantive rights or underlying causes of action in the suit. Indeed, the purpose of the Consent Order is to provide the Plaintiff with security for costs as an interim measure while the parties’ respective claims are still pending litigation and while their underlying causes of action are still awaiting final determination. That the Consent Order provides for proceedings in the counterclaim to be stayed until the provision of the security by the Defendant fortifies the position that parties in this case have yet to arrive at any resolution of a substantive nature.</a></p><a id="p1_40"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the court should exercise its residual discretion not to enforce the Consent Order </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a><a id="p1_41">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the ambit of when such a discretion may be exercised, the High Court in <em>Wellmix Organics</em> pointed out that the manner in which the court draws the line is by ascertaining whether the conduct of the party in breach was of such an extreme degree of contumeliousness or contumaciousness that the consent unless order ought to operate to deprive it of all its rights in the litigation (at [100]):</a></p><a id="p1_41"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;…In other words, the court recognises that there will be a limited number of situations where, despite the otherwise impeccable legal status of a consent unless order, the conduct by the party in breach is still insufficient to warrant the enforcement of that order, thus depriving the party in breach of all its rights in the litigation. At this juncture, the manner in which the court draws the line is to ascertain whether the conduct of the party in breach is not only intentionally contumelious or contumacious (this would suffice for relief for the party in breach under the <em>existing law</em>) <em>but also whether or not such conduct was of not such an extreme degree of contumeliousness or contumaciousness that the consent unless order ought to operate to deprive it of all its rights in the litigation</em>. Such an approach was in fact itself suggested by counsel for the plaintiff in the present proceedings on the assumption that I was minded to adopt the approach suggested by Lord Denning MR in <em>Purcell</em>. I would prefer this particular approach on the assumption that the discretion would be exercised by the court to bring relief to the party in breach where the breach was not truly egregious and that such occasions would not be so numerous as to undermine the concept of consent unless orders generally. Indeed, as already pointed out, consent unless orders appear, in any event, to be very rare in the first instance...</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(Emphasis in italics in original)</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a><a id="p1_42">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of <em>Syed Mohamed Abdul Muthaliff and another v Arjan Bhisham Chotrani</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1999] 1 SLR(R) 0361.xml')">[1999] 1 SLR(R) 361</a> (“<em>Syed Mohamed</em>”) should also be mentioned. In <em>Syed Mohamed</em>, the unless order provides that the appellants should file and serve the required further and better particulars on the respondent within ten days, in default thereof, the counterclaim was to be struck out without further order. The appellants failed to meet the deadline, and initially its counterclaim was struck out. The appellants appealed against the striking out order, and applied for the reinstatement of their counterclaim as well as an extension of time to file and serve the required further and better particulars.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43">43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellants did not succeed before the district judge as well as the High Court. However, the Court of Appeal decided that the appellant’s default did not warrant the striking out of their counterclaim, and exercised its discretion to allow the appellant an extension of time to file and serve the required further and better particulars. The following principles can be gleaned from <em>Syed Mohamed</em>:</a></p><a id="p1_43"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43"></a><a id="p1_43-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the court to extend the time for complying with an unless order should be exercised cautiously for a very good reason (at [10]). The onus is on the defaulting party to show why his failure to obey the order does not warrant the striking out of the claim by establishing that there was no intention to ignore the peremptory order (at [13]).</a></p><a id="p1_43-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_43-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether or not the default was “intentional and contumelious” is not the sole criterion upon which the discretion of the court is exercised. The crux of the matter is that the party seeking to escape the consequences of his default must show that he had made positive efforts to comply but was prevented from doing so by extraneous circumstances (at [14]).</a></p><a id="p1_43-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_43-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether or not there has been prejudice to the other party is also a factor to be taken into account. The nature of the relief sought by the party in default and whether or not the penalty imposed is proportionate to the default in question are also relevant (at [15]). In short, all the circumstances of the case must be taken into account.</a></p><a id="p1_43-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_44">44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal cited and applied these principles in respect of what appears to be a <em>consent</em> unless order on the particular facts of <em>Syed Mohamed</em> (see <em>Syed Mohamed</em> at [20] and <em>Wellmix Organics</em> at [101]). As such, I consider the principles in <em>Syed Mohamed</em> to be instructive for the purposes of assessing whether the court’s residual discretion should be exercised in favour of not enforcing the Consent Order and allowing the Defendant an extension of time to comply with paragraph 2 of the Consent Order.</a></p><a id="p1_44"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Contumeliousness and contumaciousness of conduct</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a><a id="p1_45">45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explanation for the Defendant’s default was stated in the supporting affidavit filed by the Defendant’s solicitors and may be summarised as follows. After the Consent Order was entered on 24 August 2022, the Defendant’s solicitors left the matter in the care of their accounts department (instead of the staff on the file) to monitor any incoming transfer. There was also some miscommunication that resulted in some delay by the Defendant in transferring the agreed security sums to the Defendant solicitor’s client account.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a> At the material time, the Defendant’s solicitors were also handling ongoing arbitration proceedings in a separate matter. Parties in that arbitration matter were directed by the tribunal to file and exchange closing submissions by 2 September 2022,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> which happened to be the deadline for the Defendant to furnish the security under the Consent Order.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46">46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking into account the overall circumstances of the case, I accept that the Defendant’s default was due to an administrative oversight as compounded by a mix of both internal and external circumstances. Crucially, once the Defendant’s solicitors were alerted to the default, they responded immediately and took steps to comply with the Consent Order by furnishing to the Plaintiff the solicitors’ undertaking within the same day. This undertaking provided by the Defendant’s solicitors on 7 September 2022 remains valid and effectual.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a> Given the Defendant’s readiness and willingness to provide the security promptly after realising its error, I am satisfied that the Defendant bore no intention to deliberately ignore or flout the Consent Order. The one-off failure to comply with the deadline did not demonstrate intentionally contumelious or contumacious conduct, much less any conduct of an extreme degree of contumeliousness or contumaciousness warranting the complete deprivation of the Defendant’s right to pursue its counterclaim.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Prejudice and proportionality</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47">47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff urged the court to hold the Defendant to the consequence which the Defendant had knowingly and willingly accepted and agreed. It was further argued that the Plaintiff should not be deprived of its substantive rights under the Consent Order (being the dismissal of the Defendant’s counterclaim) as the Plaintiff would otherwise suffer prejudice which cannot be compensated with costs.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a> I am unable to accept the Plaintiff’s argument for two reasons.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48">48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Plaintiff could not articulate any prejudice suffered beyond stating that it would otherwise have been entitled to a dismissal of the counterclaim. This however presupposes the conclusion and begs the very question to be answered by the court (i.e. whether the court should dismiss the counterclaim despite having the discretion not to do so). On the facts, the solicitors’ undertaking was furnished a few days late (i.e. on 7 September 2022 instead of 2 September 2022), but this is not a prejudice that cannot be compensated by costs.</a></p><a id="p1_48"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a><a id="p1_49">49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, a complete dismissal of the Defendant’s counterclaim would be wholly disproportionate to the inadvertent breach which I find to be neither contumelious nor contumacious. The mere delay of a few days in providing security could not be said to be so egregious as to warrant the harshest of consequence. In my view, to impose the full penalty on the Defendant in this case would occasion the very form of injustice sought to be prevented by way of an exercise of the court’s inherent powers.</a></p><a id="p1_49"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a><a id="p1_50">50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the Consent Order is a consent unless order and/or a procedural consent order. The court therefore retains a residual discretion not to enforce, in the absence of a high degree of intentionally contumacious or contumelious conduct, the Consent Order. On the facts, the Defendant’s breach of paragraph 2 of the Consent Order was not of such an extreme degree of contumeliousness or contumaciousness as to warrant the draconian consequence of having the counterclaim dismissed.</a></p><a id="p1_50"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a><a id="p1_51">51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my judgment, this is an appropriate case where the court should exercise its discretion to bring relief to the party in breach by not enforcing the Consent Order against the Defendant. Accordingly, the Defendant was granted an extension of time, up to 7 September 2022, to comply with paragraph 2 of the Consent Order. As the required security has already been furnished to the Plaintiff by way of the Defendant solicitors’ undertaking dated 7 September 2022, this security shall stand good such that the Defendant would effectively be taken to have complied with paragraph 2 of the Consent Order.</a></p><a id="p1_51"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a><a id="p1_52">52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards costs, the Defendant suggested that parties should bear their own costs as the matter could have been resolved amicably without troubling the court. To my mind however, it was the Defendant’s breach of the Consent Order which necessitated the present application in the first place. It was not unreasonable for the Plaintiff to have taken a different view from the Defendant on the contested issues. Having regard to O 59 r 3(4) ROC 2014, and considering the duration of hearing and complexity of submissions, I fixed costs of the application at $1,800 (all-in) to be paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiff.</a></p><a id="p1_52"> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"></a><p class="Footnote"><a id="p1_52"><sup></sup></a><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a>Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at [4(1)].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at [27(1)].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at [27(2)].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at [27(3)].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_5_1" id="Ftn_5">[note: 5]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at [27(4)].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_6_1" id="Ftn_6">[note: 6]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at [30].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_7_1" id="Ftn_7">[note: 7]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at [27(3)].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_8_1" id="Ftn_8">[note: 8]</a></sup>Defendant solicitor’s affidavit dated 26 September 2022 at [7].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_9_1" id="Ftn_9">[note: 9]</a></sup>Defendant solicitor’s affidavit dated 26 September 2022 at [8].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_10_1" id="Ftn_10">[note: 10]</a></sup>Defendant solicitor’s affidavit dated 26 September 2022 at [12], Defendant’s Written Submissions at [3].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_11_1" id="Ftn_11">[note: 11]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at [4(2)].</p></div></content></html>
