This is vital for ensuring that litigation is carried on with despatch and efficiency, and dilatory parties have found over the years that an application to reinstate is infrequently allowed, with reinstatement being the exception rather than the rule: <em>Moguntia-Est Epices SA v Sea-Hawk Freight Pte Ltd</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2003] 4 SLR(R) 0429.xml')">[2003] 4 SLR(R) 429</a> (“<em>Moguntia</em>”) at [21].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, matters continue to fall dormant, and reinstatement applications continue to surface before the courts, with the recent decisions <em>of Lim Boon Chong v B Sivaraj</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/28742-SSP.xml')">[2022] SGDC 207</a> (“<em>Lim Boon Chong</em>”) and <em>Muhammad Sadiq Bin Syed Kadir and another v Ong Hui Shan</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27374-SSP.xml')">[2022] SGDC&nbsp;78</a> bearing testament to this unfortunate tendency.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present application adds to the body of decisions in this regard. The Plaintiff, Mr Ho Sheng Qin, is a Malaysian national who met with a motor accident caused by the Defendant’s negligence in July 2017. Through his then-counsel, Mr Nedumaran Muthukrishnan (“Mr Nedumaran”), the present claim was initiated, and in June 2019, consent interlocutory judgment was obtained on a 50% liability basis (“the IJ”). Directions to move the matter towards an assessment of damages were obtained on 24 October 2019 (“the Trigger Date”), but no further steps were taken until more than three years later, when on 23 November 2022, the Plaintiff filed a Notice of Change of Solicitors to substitute Mr Nedumaran’s services with that of his present solicitors from Hoh Law Corporation (“HLC”). The summons to reinstate the matter was taken out shortly thereafter.</a></p><a id="p1_3"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is undisputed that the <em>Moguntia</em> factors or guidelines are the appropriate reference points for determining whether reinstatement should be allowed.

As the Plaintiff has detailed over the course of his lengthy affidavits in support of this reinstatement application, he was actively involved in the pursuit of his claim from the get-go, and he had appointed Mr Nedumaran for the precise purpose of pursuing this claim.</a></p><a id="p1_5"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, even though he had to return to Malaysia after his employment in Singapore was terminated, he continued to be involved in communications with Mr&nbsp;Nedumaran through his brother, Raymond, who remained resident in Singapore. In October 2018, Raymond created a WhatsApp group with Mr&nbsp;Nedumaran and the Plaintiff, and the Plaintiff utilised this group to chase Mr Nedumaran for updates on his case. There were subsequent disagreements between the Plaintiff and Mr Nedumaran, and discussions turned to whether he would discharge Mr Nedumaran from acting as his solicitor. However, he eventually decided against doing so due to costs considerations. After repeated chasers, the Plaintiff affirmed his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief for the trial on liability on November 2018, but in June 2019, during the hearing for the trial, a settlement was reached, and the IJ was entered.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Inaction after the trigger date</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater difficulty is presented by the second factor, which pertains to the steps taken by him after the Trigger Date on 24 October 2019. After directions for the assessment phase had been obtained, the Plaintiff waited for an update from Mr Nedumaran. However, with none forthcoming, he sought an update on 31 December 2019. This was followed by a string of messages between himself and Mr Nedumaran, and on 15 January 2020, he attended at Mr Nedumaran’s office in Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a> During that meeting, Mr Nedumaran said that some accident cases could take as long as two to five years to close, and since his matter was slightly under three years old at the time, he decided not to bother Mr Nedumaran further and to let him do his job.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That meeting on 15 January 2020 was the last time the Plaintiff saw Mr Nedumaran in person. Shortly thereafter, the COVID-19 pandemic caused both Singapore and Malaysia to put in place travel restrictions. The Plaintiff, who had returned to Malaysia, thought that “the global chaos caused by the pandemic” led to the whole world “com[ing] to a standstill”.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a> He did not seek any updates from Mr Nedumaran in the meantime, and on 24 October 2020 (“the Guillotine Date”), one year after the Trigger Date, the matter was automatically discontinued.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff only decided to message Mr Nedumaran to seek an update on the case on 22 March 2021.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a> This was met with no reply. Further chasers by text messages, emails and phone calls were also unsuccessful. The Plaintiff then took many steps, such as to travel to Singapore after the land borders reopened, to find Mr Nedumaran, but again without success. After much effort, he finally convinced HLC to take over the conduct of his case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the above, it can be seen that the Plaintiff and his solicitor, Mr Nedumaran, plainly failed to take <em>any</em> steps to prosecute his claim from 16 January 2020 to 22 March 2021. In fact, nothing was going on in the background, whether by way of negotiations or otherwise, and not a single chaser was sent by either one of them.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff has raised several reasons to explain this inactivity, such as his alleged fear of offending Mr Nedumaran and because he had expected his case to take a few more years to resolve. These reasons do not, in my view, suffice to excuse his inaction in at least seeking updates for his case for more than a year. In his affidavit, the Plaintiff has detailed that he allegedly became fearful of Mr Nedumaran after a confrontation in October 2018, when Mr Nedumaran had shouted at him after he repeatedly requested for updates.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a> Despite this, the evidence clearly shows that both the Plaintiff and his brother continued to press Mr Nedumaran for updates <em>after</em> October 2018.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The tone of the messages exchanged was largely cordial, and does not explain why the Plaintiff suddenly ceased messaging Mr Nedumaran after their meeting on 15 January 2020.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A careful review of the Plaintiff’s affidavits suggests that he simply dropped the ball because he had formed the mistaken view that the world (and his case) had come to a halt because of the pandemic. This is not uncommon. The pandemic has frequently been cited as a reason for a party’s default. However, as observed in <em>Lim Boon Chong</em> ([2] <em>supra</em>) at [14], “[m]uch effort has been taken to ensure that legal proceedings can continue to progress during the pandemic. Many proceedings have in fact so progressed through the pandemic, as testament to these efforts”. In fact, applications for foreign witnesses to give evidence remotely were readily granted during that difficult period. Put simply, the travel restrictions do not suffice to shield the Plaintiff from taking any steps during the relevant period. While the travel restrictions certainly inhibited his ability to travel to Singapore, they do not explain why he failed to even seek an update by <em>text</em> until more than a year after the meeting on 15 January 2020.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that said, I acknowledge that some blame for the dormancy of the matter should lie with Mr Nedumaran. Like the foreign plaintiff in <em>Kim Seong Mo v Securiforce Sdn Bhd and another</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25797-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGDC 297</a> (“<em>Kim Seong Mo</em>”), the Plaintiff here is a foreigner who relied on his solicitor in Singapore to pursue his claim. There is nothing to suggest that he was even made aware of the possibility of an automatic discontinuance of his matter. Nonetheless, this does not excuse the Plaintiff’s inaction because “the courts have consistently taken the position that even where the contumelious conduct is that of the litigant’s solicitor rather than that of the litigant himself, the litigant has to bear the consequences of such contumely” (<em>Changhe International Investments Pte Ltd (formerly known as Druidstone Pte Ltd) v Dexia BIL Asia Singapore Ltd (formerly known as Banque Internationale A Luxembourg BIL (Asia) Ltd</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2005] 3 SLR(R) 0344.xml')">[2005] 3 SLR(R) 344</a> at [12]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout his lengthy affidavits, the Plaintiff has also set out the steps he took <em>after</em> 22 March 2021, when he revived his interest in his matter. This included sporadic attempts to make contact with Mr Nedumaran by way of email, phone calls, and messages, but all such attempts went unanswered.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a> During this period, the Plaintiff was also burdened with his personal affairs as his close guardian had fallen very sickly, and as he was struggling to find jobs to make ends meet.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this, in July 2022, shortly after the land border between Singapore and Malaysia was reopened, the Plaintiff travelled from Penang to Singapore, only to find that Mr Nedumaran’s office was no longer in the same building.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a> After a full day of searching, he could not locate Mr Nedumaran, and so the next day, he visited the office of HLC to seek assistance on his matter. HLC sought an update on the matter from the Law Society of Singapore, only to be informed that Mr Nedumaran had not renewed his Practicing Certificate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> A cause book search then revealed that the matter had been automatically discontinued since October 2020. A credit search further revealed that Mr Nedumaran had a pending bankruptcy application against him. In August 2022, Mr Nedumaran replied to the Plaintiff on WhatsApp, offering to meet up with him the next week.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> However, this meeting never transpired. During the same period, Mr Nedumaran also informed HLC that he would arrange to deliver documents pertaining to this matter to their offices, but despite repeated chasers, he failed to do so.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff was then advised by HLC that his two options were to apply for reinstatement or to commence proceedings against Mr Nedumaran for professional negligence. As regards the latter cause of action, the Plaintiff contacted Lockton Singapore Pte Ltd (“Lockton”) to ask if Mr Nedumaran had professional liability insurance coverage, but Lockton replied that they could not release such information.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a> The Plaintiff spent the months of August to October 2022 commuting between Singapore and Malaysia, returning here on visitor passes to look for a law firm to assist him on his matter. Such efforts proved futile as he could not afford the upfront legal costs required by the firms that he contacted. As a Malaysian citizen, he was also ineligible for legal aid notwithstanding his financial circumstances. After almost three months of searching in vain, he returned to HLC, who agreed to take up his case upon hearing of his “plight and sorrowful condition”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On HLC’s request, Mr Nedumaran agreed to provide an affidavit by December 2023.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a> However, he repeatedly defaulted on this, and till date, no affidavit has been provided by Mr Nedumaran.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> HLC also contacted Lockton in an attempt to obtain information about Mr Nedumaran’s insurance coverage, but Lockton again replied that due to issues of confidentiality, they could not answer such queries.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> Left with little choice, HLC took out the present application to reinstate the matter in January 2023.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wee submits that the any step taken <em>after</em> the matter had been automatically discontinued is irrelevant to the assessment of whether the inaction is excusable. What is crucial, it is submitted, is that from 16 January 2020 until the Guillotine Date, there was “complete silence” on the Plaintiff’s part. This amounts to ten months of inaction which is inexcusable because the pandemic was a global event. Despite the pandemic, many other matters involving foreigners continued to progress, and messages could have been sent. But no such action was taken.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to recall that the second <em>Moguntia</em> factor requires the court to assess whether “in <em>all</em> the circumstances [the Plaintiff’s] failure to take any step in the action <em>since the trigger date</em> … is excusable” [emphasis added] (<em>Moguntia</em> ([1] <em>supra</em>) at [21(<em>b</em>)]). The quoted passage does not indicate that when considering whether the plaintiff’s inaction is inexcusable, the court is limited to considering steps from the trigger date to the guillotine date (<em>ie</em>, the date of discontinuance) only. Indeed, in <em>Moguntia</em>, the court expressly considered conduct <em>after</em> the guillotine date when making the assessment of whether the plaintiffs’ inaction could be excused. As Judith Prakash J (as she then was) concluded at [29] of <em>Moguntia</em>, “[t]he plaintiffs have not furnished me with sufficient facts to determine that their failure to do anything for 16 months <em>after the action was automatically discontinued</em> … was <em>excusable</em>” [emphasis added].</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, I do not accept that any step <em>after</em> the Guillotine Date is irrelevant for the purposes of determining whether the Plaintiff’s inaction should be excused. Rather, a holistic assessment of <em>all</em> the steps taken after the Trigger Date is necessary. For instance, the reinstatement application in <em>Ng Ah Lay v Dumoulin Leon (Dumoulin Charles Leopold Elisabeth)</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/46077-M.xml')">[2004] SGDC 262</a> (“<em>Ng Ah Lay</em>”) which was taken out a mere month after the matter was automatically discontinued was allowed because up to the guillotine date, the case was still being moved along, albeit at a “somewhat relaxed pace” (<em>Ng Ah Lay</em> at [14]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same cannot be said about the Plaintiff’s inactivity in the present case. Here, he simply failed to take any steps, or to give any regard to his claim in Singapore from 16 January 2020 to 22 March 2021. This period in excess of one year has not been properly accounted for, and can at best be explained as mere inadvertence that was caused by a combination of various factors, such as the unforeseeable global pandemic and the Plaintiff’s resignation to his counsel’s lackadaisical management of his case. However, as Choo Han Teck J explained in <em>Yip Kong Ban and another v Lin Jian Sheng Eric and another</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 3 SLR 0718.xml')">[2010] 3 SLR 718</a> at [5], “inadvertence, unfortunately, is not sufficient. … If mere inadvertence alone was sufficient to re-instate a cause or matter deemed discontinued, [the automatic discontinuance provision] would be of little use and [applications for reinstatement] would just be a formality”. In a similar vein, it has been noted that a plaintiff’s failure to act within the generous time limits will not ordinarily be explicable or excusable by sudden forgetfulness, temporary indisposition, pressure of work, or vagaries of the post (<em>Moguntia</em> at [18], citing <em>Rastin v British Steel plc</em> [1994] 2 All ER 641 at 647, per Lord Bingham).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I give due heed to the Plaintiff’s significant resolve <em>after</em> 22 March 2021, I do not see how such steps taken after the fact can reasonably be sufficient to excuse his and Mr Nedumaran’s inactivity the lengthy period prior. If so, any party who demonstrates sufficient contrition upon finding out that his action has been discontinued would have to be excused for the prior inaction. This would cause the exception to swallow the rule, and gravely undermine the purpose of the automatic discontinuance provision, which is to enable the courts to efficiently manage its caseload, and to clear dormant suits from its lists (see <em>Ng Ah Lay</em> at [20] and <em>Moguntia</em> at [21]). Considered as a whole, and giving particular regard to the prolonged period of inactivity, I cannot see how the Plaintiff’s lengthy omission can be excused.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Balance of justice </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given my finding above, I need not consider whether it would be in the balance of justice to grant the reinstatement. Nonetheless, were it necessary to decide as such, I would have found that the balance of justice lies in favour of reinstatement.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, the Defendant’s insurers, India International Insurance Pte Ltd (“III”) has explained on affidavit that because of the lapse in time, they released the reserve held for this matter as they considered that they were “relatively safe from the threat of further litigation”.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a> The reinstatement of the action would prejudice III’s bottom-lines for 2022 (the year the reserves were released) and 2023 (the year the proceedings will be reinstated).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my judgment, this is insufficient to tend the balance of justice in favour of the insurers. Any accounting difficulty can be readily compensated by an order of costs. The “hardship” suffered by III in this regard cannot, in any case, outweigh the hardship that would be suffered by the Plaintiff if the reinstatement were disallowed, given that any fresh action would be time-barred.</a></p><a id="p1_25"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Plaintiff has already secured an IJ against the Defendant, and so all that remains to be done is for the appropriate quantum of damages to be assessed. At the assessment phase, III, with conduct of the defence, will be fully entitled to challenge the quantum of Plaintiff’s claim (see <em>Kim Seong Mo</em> ([13] <em>supra</em>) at [50]). The Plaintiff has also sworn on affidavit that he is ready to waive his entitlement to interest for the period since the discontinuance till date.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a> This suffices to negate any prejudice that might be suffered by the Defendant due to the increase in interest payable during the effluxion of time in this case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the Plaintiff and his new solicitors HLC have expended significant resources in considering the alternative of suing Mr Nedumaran for professional negligence. This would have been a more straightforward route, but the combination of Mr Nedumaran’s cessation of practice, potential financial embarrassment, and his insurer’s unwillingness to disclose whether he was covered by insurance at the material time render this route less practical.</a></p><a id="p1_27"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For completeness, while I recognise that the Plaintiff’s claim would be time-barred if brought under a new action, I do not consider this to be sufficient to turn the balance in the Defendant’s favour. As has been observed in several cases, the argument that reinstating an action would deny a defendant of an accrued defence of limitation that arose <em>after</em> the matter was automatically discontinued is inherently circular because whether the defence accrues depends on whether the action is reinstated; if the action is reinstated, there would be no accrued defence of limitation: see, <em>eg, The “Melati”</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2003] 4 SLR(R) 0575.xml')">[2003] 4 SLR(R) 575</a> at [16], <em>Kim Seong Mo</em> at [47], <em>Ng Ah Lay</em> ([20] <em>supra</em>) at [18], and <em>Lim Boon Chong</em> ([2] <em>supra</em>) at [17]. In fairness, Mr Wee did not press this point in his submissions.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, while I accept that the Plaintiff prosecuted the claim with sufficient diligence prior to the Trigger Date, and further that the balance of justice lies in favour of reinstatement, I dismiss his application because the lengthy period of inaction leading to the automatic discontinuance is, on a careful assessment, inexcusable.</a></p><a id="p1_29"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In coming to this decision, I express deep sympathy for the Plaintiff’s plight, and acknowledge the contrition and resolve he has shown since discovering that his action was automatically discontinued. Mr Namasivayam Srinivasan and HLC should also be commended for taking on the Plaintiff’s case notwithstanding his financial straits and despite the obvious challenges presented. They did so when many others declined, and put forth a persuasive case for reinstatement.
