However, he was again sentenced to two years imprisonment in 1999 for the same offence. A plausible explanation for this could be due to the application of the totality principle by the sentencing court in 1999. This was because the two years’ imprisonment term was ordered to run consecutively with the mandatory minimum sentence of five years’ imprisonment term for the offence of drug trafficking under s 5(1)(a) of the MDA. Hence, in order that the total sentence was not crushing on the Accused, the sentencing court could very well have decided not to apply the escalation principle in the sentence on the unauthorised possession of controlled drug charge in 1999, and again imposed a sentence of two years’ imprisonment. Hence, for the purpose of arriving at the imprisonment term that would likely be imposed on the Accused for this charge under step one in stage two of the framework, the likely sentence could very well have been four years’ imprisonment. This would have resulted in the total sentence that was likely to be imposed on the Accused to be up to six years’ imprisonment, well above the minimum sentence of five years for CT.</a></p><a id="p1_31"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I called for suitability reports for both CT and PD to be prepared for the Accused, since he had already undergone two stints of CT and yet was still re-offending after his release.</a></p><a id="p1_32"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Reports</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both reports<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a> found the Accused to be generally in good physical condition with no known major illnesses.

In the circumstances, I sentenced the Accused to eight years of PD, the same duration as the likely global imprisonment term that would be imposed on the Accused as stated in [46] above.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50">50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The High Court in <em>Sim Yeow Kee</em> also held at [121] that once it was accepted that there was no longer any “qualitative” difference between CT (and PD) and regular imprisonment, there can be no justification for not backdating the commencement date of a CT (and PD) sentence to take into account the time spent in remand. I therefore backdated the PD sentence to 24 June 2022, the date from which the Accused was remanded when his bail was revoked.</a></p><a id="p1_50"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a><a id="p1_51">51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused, being dissatisfied with the above sentence, has since appealed against the same.
