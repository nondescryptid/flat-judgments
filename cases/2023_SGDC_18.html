The claim is premised on the defendant having overstayed his welcome when the two-year tenancy which commenced in January 2020 ended on 31 January 2022. This is strongly denied by the defendant in view of the purported exercise of a guaranteed option in the tenancy agreement to renew the tenancy for a year. What is undisputed is that the defendant has since remained on the premises, at least up to the date of the hearing of the Registrar’s Appeal (“RA”) before me on 16 January 2023.</a></p><a id="p1_1"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RA is a rehearing where confirmatory and not appellate jurisdiction is exercised. In this regard, I am guided in my approach by the decision of the Court of Appeal in <em>Tan Boon Heng v Lau Pang Cheng David</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 0718.xml')">[2013] 4 SLR 718</a> at [18] and [46]. Insofar as the applicable principles for summary judgment are concerned, these are succinctly distilled by Goh Yihan JC at [17-19] of <em>Ho Choon Han v SCP Holdings Pte Ltd</em> [2022] SGHC cited at [8] of the GD.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issue to be determined</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As noted by the DR, everything turns on whether the tenancy agreement was validly renewed and the interpretation of the clauses dealing with renewal of the tenancy.

It is also the defendant’s position that the handwritten guaranteed option supersedes clause 4(g) rendering that clause inapplicable. Consequently, the claimants are not entitled to summary judgment and/or in the alternative, the judgment should be stayed pending the outcome of the counterclaim. The defendant also disputes the quantum of the costs that was awarded by the DR.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things considered, having reheard the application and given due regard to the submissions of both the claimants and the defendants before me, I find myself in broad agreement with the conclusions of the DR that this was an appropriate case for summary judgment and there was no valid exercise of the guaranteed option.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I agree with the DR for the reasons stated at [14-15] of the well-reasoned GD that there was clearly no mutual agreement on the rent to be paid for an extended tenancy at the reduced rate of $ 2500.00 as argued by the defendant. As noted by the DR, the words “going forward” were never used by the plaintiffs in the abovementioned Whatsapp correspondence; the defendant did not exhibit any evidence in support of the alleged agreement; and there was nothing to suggest that the rental reduction was to apply to the renewal. While it is true that there is nothing said to the contrary, one would have expected the duration of the reduction to have been raised or documented, especially by the defendant given how important this reduction was to his decision to hold on to the rental premises in the face of the losses that were being incurred because of the Covid-19 situation.</a></p><a id="p1_9"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether there was mutual agreement for renewal at $ 2500.00 per month</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the RA is a rehearing, I will address the arguments canvassed in the defendant’s written submissions (“DWS”) and orally at the hearing, in turn.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the reasons advanced by the DR at [14-15] of the GD amply support the conclusion that the tenant’s argument is not capable of belief within the meaning of the decision in <em>M2B World Asia Pacific Pte Ltd v Matsumura Akihiko</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16842-SSP.xml')">[2015] 1 SLR 325</a>. I should state that in the absence of evidence regarding commercial practice, I would not go as far as the DR to state at [16] of the GD that it made no commercial sense for the landlords to fix the rental at $ 2500.00 for future renewals since there may be many and varied commercial considerations why parties may come to an agreement. As noted by the defendant in oral submission, it is important to consider the case from the perspective of all sides, which the DR did, impartially assessing the evidence to arrive at the conclusion that there was no mutual agreement on the rent for the renewal period.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That there is no mutual agreement on the rent at $ 2500.00 for the renewal period is supported by the defendant’s interpretation of the effect of the guaranteed renewal clause at [21-22] of DWS that was reiterated at the hearing before me. Applying an objective interpretation of the guaranteed renewal clause in its entirety, I agree with the defendant that the claimants’ entitlement to rent for the renewal period would be capped at $ 3080.00 and the guaranteed option, subject to clause 4(g), would have been exercisable by the defendant at $ 3080.00. This interpretation of the effect of the guaranteed renewal clause is shared by the claimants as evident from the oral submissions of counsel for the claimants. It is also reinforced by the contemporaneous efforts through their real estate agent Jessie Lye (“Jessie”) and then solicitors Sterling Law Corporation (“Sterling”) to communicate with the defendant from November 2021 on the renewal of the tenancy.</a></p><a id="p1_12"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The claimants initially sought through Jessie on 5 November 2021 an increased monthly rental of $ 3200.00 that would exceed the cap imposed by the guaranteed renewal clause. They also communicated via Whatsapp and email on 11 November 2021 the intention of the landlords to take back the premises. The defendant apparently also called the 1<sup>st</sup> claimant by telephone on 11 November 2021 to salvage the situation, although this call is not admitted by the claimants. According to the defendant, the 1<sup>st</sup> claimant maintained the decision to end the tenancy. What is not disputed is that Jessie messaged the defendant’s wife the next day <em>i.e.</em> 12 November 2021 to inform that the claimants were willing to renew the tenancy at $ 3080.00.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Jessie did not receive any response, Sterling wrote to the defendant on 17 November 2021 to enquire if he intended to renew the tenancy to which there was no response. On 12 January 2022, Sterling sent the defendant a tenancy agreement for the renewed term of one (1) year at a monthly rent of $ 3080.00 for their signature, requiring the defendant to respond by 20 January 2022 failing which it would be deemed that the defendant would not be renewing. The defendant only issued the notice to exercise the guaranteed option to renew on 27 January 2022 and a strongly worded reply dated 29 January 2022 to Sterling’s letter of 12 January 2022. The reply highlighted an error of one day in the tenancy agreement for the renewed term, objected to the deadline of 20 January 2022 set by the lawyers, accused the claimants of dishonesty and multiple breaches of the contract, and notified them of his intention to claim damages against them.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These communications and the subsequent correspondence between the defendant and Sterling demonstrate that the key point of difference regarding the validity of the renewal was the monthly rental of $ 2500.00 that the defendant was prepared to pay and $ 3080.00 that the claimants were prepared to accept. The claimants were prepared to accept this sum even after the expiry of the original tenancy as is clear from Sterling’s letter of 3 February 2022 where the defendant was requested to sign the tenancy agreement for the renewed term at the monthly rent of $ 3080.00. This strongly suggests to me that the reasons given by the defendant in oral arguments as well as his counterclaim for not responding to Jessie and Sterling much earlier <em>i.e.</em> because he was devastated by the decision of the claimants conveyed on 11 November 2021 to take back the premises and knew that there would be no point discussing since he was shut out of the Whatsapp group are mere afterthoughts. From the tone and tenor of the defendant’s communications with Sterling on the exercise of the renewal and counterclaims alluded to above, feeling devastated and resigned upon being informed of the intention not to renew on 11 November 2021 appears out of character for the defendant. In any case, the decision not to renew was reversed the very next day. The defendant’s inexcusable silence and failure to communicate with the claimants on the renewal until a very late stage undermines the credibility of the defence that he is now trying to raise to escape the consequences of his actions.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the defendant has alleged that it was the claimants who were unwilling to allow him to exercise his guaranteed option, the evidence and correspondence outlined above clearly suggests the contrary. Rather, it was the defendant who was intent on exercising the guaranteed option unilaterally at the price of $ 2500.00 which was never agreed to. The one-day difference in the duration of the extension and the difference in the reinstatement clause were also matters that should have been raised contemporaneously if the defendant was indeed serious about the renewal.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether defendant entitled to equitable relief of rectification</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the defendant appears to now accept that the renewal could potentially be at $ 3080.00 and is seeking the equitable relief of rectification as indicated at [23-24] of DWS, this is very much an afterthought without any merit whatsoever. The present case concerns interpretation rather than rectification of the tenancy agreement and the conditions stated in <em>Yap Son On v Ding Pei Zhen</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19965-SSP.xml')">[2017] 1 SLR 219</a> (“<em>Yap Son On</em>”) are not satisfied. With respect, there is no proof whatsoever, let alone “convincing proof” as set out in [65] of <em>Yap Son On</em> that “the document to be rectified was not in accordance with the parties’ true intention at the time of execution but also that the document in its proposed form would accord with that intention (see <em>PD International</em> at [29].” Apart from not pleading the relief, the defendant has also not proposed the form of the rectification that is sought. Furthermore, as noted at [68] of <em>Yap Son On</em>, while equitable relief may be available even if not pleaded, it can only be done if the result was otherwise plainly contrary to the parties’ agreement, which is not the case here.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether clause 4(g) is applicable</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the applicability or otherwise of clause 4 (g), I disagree with the submission of the defendant that it is superseded by the handwritten guaranteed renewal clause, allowing the defendant to give notice at any time. As the clause was not deleted, it should be read together with the guaranteed renewal clause to impose a requirement on the defendant to give notice not less than two months before the expiry of the tenancy. As such, in addition to there being no mutual agreement on the rental for the renewal and thus no valid exercise of the guaranteed renewal option, the notice on 27 January 2022 was out of time and another reason to conclude that there is no credible defence to the application for summary judgment.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether defendant is entitled to security deposit</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to the retention by the claimants of the security deposit which the defendant says amounts to unjust enrichment, as noted by counsel for the claimants, the defendant is still in occupation of the premises. As such, the return of any deposit is premature and can be dealt with in the counterclaim as suggested by counsel for the claimants.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether judgment should be stayed pending counterclaim</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendant submitted both orally and in DWS that as an alternative to unconditional leave to defend, judgment should be stayed pending&nbsp;resolution of the counterclaim. In approaching this, I adopt the approach summarised in <em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2020</em>, vol 1 (Chua Lee Ming editor) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2019) at para 14/4/10 reproduced at [20] of the decision of S Mohan JC (as he then was) in <em>Barun Electronics Co Ltd v EZY Infotech Pte Ltd</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24807-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGHC 154</a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendant’s counterclaim is a broad ranging one against the claimants and four other non-parties to the action for which no steps have been taken to include in the action. No leave of court has been sought nor is there any indication that the non-parties have been served with the counterclaim, assuming this is even permissible, on which I venture no view. Considering only the counterclaim against the claimants, this essentially mirrors the claim and the success or otherwise of the counterclaim depends on the outcome of the claim. As submitted by counsel for the claimants, if there is no breach of the tenancy agreement by the claimants, the purported losses suffered by the defendant would be a result of a change in business premises.&nbsp;Accordingly, since summary judgment has been entered by the DR and confirmed by me, there is no valid basis or reason to stay the execution of the judgment pending resolution of the counterclaim. I would add that the fact that the renewal of the tenancy for one-year, even if valid, would have expired on 31 January 2023 is yet another reason not to stay the judgment pending the counterclaim.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether costs should be reduced</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning finally to the costs of $ 5000.00 for the application and disbursements of $ 882.40 awarded by the DR to the claimants, the defendant challenges these awards on the grounds that they are excessive and include costs for contractual interest at 10% which the claimants abandoned and authorities and documents that were unnecessary and irrelevant. Costs is at the discretion of the court and the award of $ 5000.00 is within the range prescribed by the Rules of Court 2021 of $ 3,000.00 to $ 10,000.00. These matters were also raised before the DR at the hearing on 13 December 2022 and it is clear from a perusal of the Minute Sheet that all relevant factors had been considered by the DR in arriving at the award including the two and a half hours hearing and the fact that he found the authorities useful. Accordingly, there is no merit in the defendant’s submissions on costs.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering all of the above, the RA is dismissed with costs to the claimants.
