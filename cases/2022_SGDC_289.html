After the conviction, the parties were granted time to prepare submissions on sentencing. The parties were asked to specifically address the court on the issue of whether an enhanced sentence in lieu of caning was warranted, given that the age of the accused was over 50 years, as well as the period of remand during which the accused had spent for the purpose of backdating of the sentence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having carefully considered the submissions of the parties and the circumstances presented before this court, I impose a sentence of 5 years and 2 months’ imprisonment.

The accused has a previous conviction for drug consumption in 2003 and a previous admission in 2019 to the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (“DRC”) for drug consumption. He was thus eligible to be punished with an LT1 sentence. As the accused is presently over the age of 50 years, he is exempted from caning.</a></p><a id="p1_3"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prosecution’s submissions on sentence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution submits for a sentence of 5 years and 3 months’ imprisonment.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a> In support of the proposed sentence, the Prosecution cites cases involving exempted offenders over 50 years of age who claimed trial and were convicted and were liable to LT1 punishment.

In his written plea<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> to the court, the accused claimed full responsibility for his actions. According to him, he has an aged and sickly mother to support.

He also underwent drug supervision in 2004.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Sentence </p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Length of imprisonment term</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An uplift in the sentence from the statutory mandatory minimum imprisonment term of 5 years was warranted for the following reasons:</a></p><a id="p1_7"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_7-p2_i">i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it was the prerogative of the accused to challenge and claim trial to the charge, it is recognised that a notional sentencing discount is usually accorded in cases involving offenders who pleaded guilty. Unlike an offender who pleaded guilty, the accused who claimed trial could not be accorded such a notional discount that might otherwise have been accorded to him in view of a timely plea that would have saved time and resources in determining his complicity in the offence. It must be emphasised, however, that the accused is not being penalised with a higher sentence for claiming trial. Rather, the accused cannot expect to be given the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment, which would ordinarily be imposed in similar cases where the offenders had pleaded guilty, save for those involving multiple drug offences where such other considerations as the totality principle and the consecutive rule would apply.</a></p><a id="p1_7-p2_i"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_i"></a><a id="p1_7-p2_ii">ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his credit, the accused did not challenge the integrity of the processes involving the procurement, chain of custody and scientific analysis of his urine sample, as well as the results of the analysis. The facts were largely undisputed by the Defence. However, I observed with some misgivings the manner in which the accused had conducted his defence at trial. Notwithstanding his admission that he did not have any information regarding the alleged giver of ‘G water’, the accused had mounted unsubstantiated assertions of a belated nature which only served to render his defence untenable. As pointed out by the Prosecution, the accused had sought to cast aspersions on the CNB by imputing that the investigation officer failed to conduct investigations into his defence of having consumed ‘G water’ offered by a stranger.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a> In particular, it was the accused’s contention that the prosecution’s omission to direct investigations had contributed to his failure to rebut the statutory presumption. On this note, the case of <em>Lewis Christine v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2001] 2 SLR(R) 0131.xml')">[2001] 2 SLR(R) 131</a> is instructive, where the High Court held at [38] that “…while accused persons are free to prove their innocence, it must be clear that this does not translate to a liberty to blatantly besmirch the repute of prosecution witnesses behind the shield of privilege in judicial proceedings.” Such conduct is an affront to the authorities and cannot be condoned. It is a relevant aggravating factor.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="">These observations amply demonstrated the accused’s lack of remorse and contrition, in the face of overwhelming evidence. The accused also displayed brazenness in having knowingly consumed methamphetamine shortly before undergoing the requisite urine test as a drug supervisee.</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution and the Defence agree that an uplift in the sentence from the statutory mandatory minimum of 5 years’ imprisonment is appropriate.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a> It is noteworthy that the parties are not far apart in their submissions on the proposed length of imprisonment term.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining the length of the uplift, I consider that the accused faced a single charge of drug consumption for which he was convicted. He has a few drug-related antecedents which involved primarily drug consumption. While the antecedents were not extensive, these clearly demonstrated the accused’s lack of resolve in abstaining from the consumption of controlled drugs, despite a previous court conviction, and having undergone rehabilitative treatment and supervision. As the antecedents provided the premise for the prerequisites for an LT1 punishment, I am also mindful against double counting these as an aggravating factor in sentencing. In my view, an imprisonment term of 5 years and 2 months is a sentence commensurate with the accused’s overall criminality, while not being crushing.</a></p><a id="p1_9"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether an enhanced sentence in lieu of caning should be imposed</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of <em>Amin bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21227-SSP.xml')">[2017] 5 SLR 904</a> set out the factors that may warrant an enhancement of the sentence of an exempted offender like the accused, namely, the need to compensate for the deterrent and retributive effect of caning that is lost by reason of the exemption.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notably, both the Prosecution and the Defence are aligned with the position that an enhancement in sentence in lieu of caning is unnecessary in the present case.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the uplift of 2 months’ imprisonment from the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment, I agree with the parties that the need to compensate for the lost deterrent and retributive effect of caning by reason of the exemption is less compelling in the present case.</a></p><a id="p1_12"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I backdate the sentence to the date of his arrest, namely, 27 May 2021, having regard to the period during which the accused was remanded in custody in relation to the offence.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>See <em>Public Prosecutor v Mohammed Nasir Bin Awi</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/28959-SSP.xml')">[2022] SGDC 256</a></p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>Notes of Evidence, 31 October 2022 (Day 3), p 3, lines 15-22; see also Notes of Evidence, 31 October 2022 (Day 3), p 6, lines 10-13</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>Prosecution’s skeletal sentencing submissions at [1]</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>Prosecution’s skeletal sentencing submissions at [4]; see also Annex A</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_5_1" id="Ftn_5">[note: 5]</a></sup>Prosecution’s skeletal sentencing submissions at [5]</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_6_1" id="Ftn_6">[note: 6]</a></sup>Defence skeletal mitigation plea at [2]</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_7_1" id="Ftn_7">[note: 7]</a></sup>Defence skeletal mitigation plea at [5]</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_8_1" id="Ftn_8">[note: 8]</a></sup>Mitigation letter of the accused filed on 8 December 2022</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_9_1" id="Ftn_9">[note: 9]</a></sup>Criminal Records of the accused filed on 22 June 2021; see also the Memorandum of Certified Previous Convictions</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_10_1" id="Ftn_10">[note: 10]</a></sup>Prosecution’s skeletal sentencing submissions at [5]</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_11_1" id="Ftn_11">[note: 11]</a></sup>Prosecution’s skeletal sentencing submissions at [1]; Defence skeletal mitigation plea at [2]</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_12_1" id="Ftn_12">[note: 12]</a></sup><em>Amin bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21227-SSP.xml')">[2017] 5 SLR 904</a> at [59]</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_13_1" id="Ftn_13">[note: 13]</a></sup>Prosecution’s skeletal sentencing submissions at [3]; Defence skeletal mitigation plea at [5]</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_14_1" id="Ftn_14">[note: 14]</a></sup>See s 318(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010</p></div></content></html>
