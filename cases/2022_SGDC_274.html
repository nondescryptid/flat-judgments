He was then serving an imprisonment term for a separate criminal case which took effect from 30 May 2022 and his earliest date of release is on 7 November 2023. The accused indicated that he had appealed to LTA in 2019 and 2020 but did not receive the reply. He also informed the Court that he had run away to Malaysia without a passport in 2010 and in 2014, he was extradited back to Singapore. As some of the offences were committed in 2020 and 2021, the Prosecution had sought confirmation from Singapore Prisons as to whether he was incarcerated during the relevant period. The Prosecution was informed that the accused was out on bail on 26 March 2020 and was re-admitted on 30 May 2022. The Prosecution sought an adjournment to complete investigations into the outstanding charges and urged the accused to put in representations to LTA in respect of the disputed charges as they had not received his earlier appeal letters.</a></p><a id="p1_1"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two adjournments for the Prosecution to complete their investigations, on 7 November 2022 the Prosecution indicated that out of the 27 charges faced by the accused, they would be applying for a Discharge Not Amounting to An Acquittal (“DNATA”) for 22 charges as investigations revealed that potentially he may not be the offender. As for the remaining five charges, the Prosecution indicated that they would proceed on two charges and would take into consideration three charges should he elect to plead guilty.</a></p><a id="p1_2"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same day, the accused accepted the plea offer and had pleaded guilty to two changes and admitted to the particulars of the offences as set out below without any qualification:</a></p><a id="p1_3"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>3220765291</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"></p><div align="center"> <u>Charge</u> </div><p></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Are charged that you, on 22 March 2022 at about 8:43 am along Clementi Avenue 6 into AYE (CITY), did ride/drive motor car No. SMC4155R into a specified entry point on a specified road during restricted hours with insufficient value in the ERP card inserted into the in-vehicle unit, to pay for the road-user charge and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Rule 7(1)(f) of the Road Traffic (Electronic Road Pricing System) Rules, Road Traffic Act Chapter 276.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>9211061602</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"></p><div align="center"> <u>Charge</u> </div><p></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Are charged that you, on 12 June 2021 at about 10:58 pm along Bayfront Link, being the rider/driver of motor car No. SMC4155R, did park the said vehicle where unbroken double yellow lines are laid down, in contravention of Rule 22(b) of the Road Traffic Rules, thereby committed an offence under Section 131(1) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276 and punishable under Section 131(2) of the said Act.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining three charges under Rule 7(1)(<em>f</em>) of the Road Traffic (Electronic Road Pricing System) Rules in LTA Notices No 3185928614, 3202017692 and 3210415631 were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence.

His total fine was $1,000 in default two days’ imprisonment. In addition, as he could not give a satisfactory account for his absence from Court, pursuant to s 133(6) of the RTA, I ordered him to pay for fine of $100 in default one day per occasion for each count of show cause. The total fine for the show cause was $2,300 in default 23 days’ imprisonment. The aggregate sum in respect of the two charges and his show cause was $3,300 in default 25 days’ imprisonment. As the accused is presently serving sentence in respect of his criminal case, I ordered the default sentence to take effect after the expiry of his current sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_5"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused being dissatisfied with my decision had filed his Notice of Appeal against his sentence on 9 November 2022.

He stated that Block 3 Jalan Bukit Merah #XXX was his mother-in-law’s addressed and she would have informed him. As for the address at Block 30 Kallang Place, he stated that he had never lived there before and did not know whose address it belonged to.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision on sentence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">S Rule 7(1)(f) of the Road Traffic (Electronic Road Pricing System) Rules </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The usual sentence imposed for a first offender for an offence under Rule 7(1)(<em>f</em>) of the Road Traffic (Electronic Road Pricing System) Rules is a fine between $500 to $700.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, as the accused was a first offender who had pleaded guilty to the proceeded charge, three other similar charges were taken into consideration and he was presently serving a term of imprisonment, I imposed the lower end of the usual fines imposed, namely a fine of $500 and in default the minimum period of one day’s imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_17"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Rule 22(b) of the Road Traffic Rules</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The usual sentence imposed for a first offender for an offence under Rule 22(b) of the Road Traffic is a fine between $500 to $700.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, as the accused was a first offender who had pleaded guilty to the proceeded charge, three other charges were taken into consideration and he was presently serving a term of imprisonment, I imposed the lower end of the usual fines imposed, namely a fine of $500 and in default of payment the minimum period of one day’s imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the two proceeded charges, the accused had asked to be sentenced for the proceeded charges and for the sentences to be ordered to run concurrently with his imprisonment term that he was serving. I declined to impose a custodial sentence as such regulatory offences are ordinarily punishable with fines and the accused is a first offender. Instead, I had ordered the minimum default period of one day for each charge as I had considered the fact that the accused is currently serving sentence. He would still have the option to arrange for his family members to pay the outstanding fines instead of serving the default sentence. To facilitate this, I had given permission for him to make one telephone call to enable him to do so.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Show cause</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the accused was unable to provide good reasons or a satisfactory account for his absence in court on the various occasions he was ordered to show cause, I found that cause was not shown.

The total fine for the show cause was $2,300 in default 23 days’ imprisonment. Similarly, I declined to impose a custodial sentence for each count of show cause as ordinarily fines are imposed.
