Between September 2021 and April 2022, she committed a spate of offences. The offences included dishonestly obtaining dental services from four different clinics, and using threatening communications against the staff of the clinics when her request for a waiver of the fees was refused; using threatening communications and abusive words against other entities and individuals, including a cousin; and stealing valuables and cash from a neighbour’s home. 14 charges were brought against Ng for the offences.</a></p><a id="p1_1"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ng was assigned a counsel under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS). A plead-guilty mention was fixed on 7 November 2022 for her to plead guilty. At the start of the plead-guilty proceedings on 7 November 2022, Ng’s assigned counsel applied to be discharged from further acting for Ng. Counsel informed that she had been unable to take instructions from Ng, and that CLAS was withdrawing legal aid and no other CLAS lawyer would be assigned. Ng was thus unrepresented at the plead-guilty mention. She pleaded guilty to six charges, and the remaining eight charges were taken into consideration for sentencing.</a></p><a id="p1_2"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ng was sentenced to a total of 9 months and 6 weeks’ imprisonment.

The call was received by Chan Yee Teng (“<b>Chan</b>”), a customer service staff of Illumia Wheelock. Ng told Chan that Lim Hwee Li (“<b>Lim</b>”, who was a director of Illumia), was nice, kind and always did charity, and asked if Lim was kind enough to donate $500 to her. (Ng had apparently read from Google that Lim was a charitable person.) Ng also said that she was poor and had not changed her furniture for 20&nbsp;years. She requested that Chan pass all the messages to Lim. Ng left her name as “Wong Mei Xin” with contact number XXX before ending the call.</a></p><a id="p1_12"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after, Ng called Illumia Wheelock’s landline repeatedly using the number XXX but Chan declined to answer the calls.

Chan refused and asked for assistance from her colleague, Low Jia Ling (“<b>Low</b>”), a service staff at Illumia Wheelock. Ng then spoke to Low and asked for Lim to give her $500. When Low advised Ng to seek financial assistance from a social worker, Ng replied that she was already receiving $300 a month but that was not enough. Ng said in Mandarin:</a></p><a id="p1_14"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“You’re not scared if I post that Kim Lim used expired products on customers, killing people and stab until blood all come out, first people to jump off building.”</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">and</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“You’re not scared that I use a bomb to bomb your clinic”.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A staff of Illumia Wheelock alerted the police. Upon realising that the police were on their way, Ng kept repeating the words in Mandarin and English as she walked away. Awhile later, Ng returned and showed Chan the WhatsApp message that she sent to Illumia Wheelock’s WhatsApp number. She said to Chan, “You’re really not scared if I post this and I only want S$500”. When Chan replied that the police were on their way, Ng left (and did not return again that day).</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 16 September 2021 to 3 October 2021, Ng used nine different mobile numbers to call Illumia Wheelock’s landline repeatedly, calling Lim names and threatening to defame Lim and Illumia. As Chan could not tell if the numbers belonged to a genuine customer or Ng, Chan answered the calls. As a result, Illumia Wheelock’s customers complained about their landline always being engaged.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During that period, Ng also used the same nine different mobile numbers to send numerous WhatsApp messages to Illumia Wheelock’s WhatsApp number. Chan read the messages and saw that they contained screenshots of various social media accounts belonging to local celebrities, threats to defame Lim and Illumia, and vulgar language.

Mdm Tay sought a lower sentence for her daughter Ng on account of Ng’s mental illness. Mdm Tay explained that Ng became like that when she was young, and she came from a broken family. Ng’s father was violent towards Mdm Tay because of money problems. Ng saw it and tried to protect her mother, but was hit by her father. In primary and secondary school, Ng was bullied by her classmates and had to seek treatment for her mental illness at IMH. Ng had apologised repeatedly and regretted her wrongdoing. Ng had been locked up in Changi Prison for 5 months and, during this period, she was very frightened and anxious about her sentence. Ng had suicidal thoughts. Mdm Tay urged for a light sentence for Ng so that she could return home soon and she could look for a job. Letters of apology to the victims of Ng’s offences, to which Ng affixed her thumbprint, were enclosed. Two of the victims wrote letters seeking to withdraw their cases against Ng after Ng’s mental problems had been explained to them.</a></p><a id="p1_49"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a><a id="p1_50">50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ng also made an oral mitigation plea.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a> She said that her father and mother divorced each other when she was in her mother's womb. Her father did not love her. Her mother kept using “big, heavy bamboo pole”, “big, heavy metal chains”, “big, heavy badminton racket” to beat her severely until she became seriously injured. When she went to primary school, her classmates kept bullying her and torturing her. In secondary school, her classmates also bullied and tortured her. When she went to ITE, her ITE classmates used “big, heavy fire matches” to burn her hair, face, hands and legs and all over her body, until her body was seriously injured. They beat her severely with “big, heavy hands”, “big, heavy badminton racket” and “big, heavy storybooks” until her body was seriously injured and very painful. When she went into adulthood, her “sick brain” caused her to do things she did not want to do. She kept hearing hallucinations. Her “sick brain” kept controlling her and causing her to repeat washing her hands and bathing 20 times a day. She felt depressed, stressed, anxious, unhappy. She forgot to take her medication three years ago, and that was why all her “serious mental illness” came back again. In the past few months, the prison officers had reminded her to take medicine on time, so now her serious mental illnesses had gone away and disappeared. She felt remorseful and regretful for the crimes she committed. She promised that from now on she would be a very good girl and behave well; she had turned over a new leaf. She pleaded to the court to be kind and to forgive her and do give her a last and final chance. She asked that her sentence be reduced and backdated (to the date of her remand).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentencing considerations </p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Dominant sentencing consideration: deterrence </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51">51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In deciding on the sentence, I considered the dominant sentencing consideration to be <em>deterrence</em>. Specific deterrence was particularly relevant considering Ng’s multiple antecedents, which included offences of a similar nature such as theft, breach of protection orders and intentionally causing harassment. There also appeared to have been an escalation in Ng’s offending behaviour. Her latest offences included that of obtaining services dishonestly under s 420A of the Penal Code, which are serious offences punishable with imprisonment for up to 10 years, fine, or both.</a></p><a id="p1_51"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a><a id="p1_52">52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ng was remanded for a psychiatric evaluation following her arrest on 18&nbsp;June 2022. The opinion of the consultant psychiatrist from the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) who examined Ng was that she had a complex longitudinal clinical history characterized by mood and psychotic episodes (working diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder), features of obsessive-compulsive disorder, and a background of borderline intellectual functioning and likely dysfunctional personality traits. However, no contributory link was established between the diagnosed psychiatric disorders and the offences.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a> Accordingly, Ng’s psychiatric condition did not diminish her culpability and was not a mitigating factor in sentencing.

There was a degree of planning in the manner in which Ng went about committing the offences – she had thought of bringing along a card which would be rejected for payment and using it as an excuse to leave the clinics without making payment – but it was not sophisticated. Apart from the two proceeded charges, there were two TIC charges, and the offences were committed over a period from 6&nbsp;September to 23&nbsp;December 2021. No restitution was made.

Also, an uplift from the sentences she received previously was appropriate on account of the principle of escalation. I decided that a modest escalation to 6 weeks’ imprisonment would suffice.

Her offending was persistent, and she repeatedly breached the EPO on over 28 occasions.</a></p><a id="p1_70"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a><a id="p1_71">71&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ng had antecedents which showed a poor history of lack of compliance with court orders:</a></p><a id="p1_71"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71"></a><a id="p1_71-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 8 January 2015, she was ordered to undergo treatment under a mandatory treatment order (“<b>MTO</b>”) for one year, after pleading guilty to a charge under s&nbsp;65(8) of the Women’s Charter for contravening a Personal Protection Order (“<b>PPO</b>”) which restrained her from using family violence against her mother, by slapping her mother on the back of her head.

Ng was also sentenced to 6 weeks’ imprisonment for another charge of contravening a PPO by making multiple phone calls to her mother, telling her mother to will all her assets to Ng, and that her mother would be knocked down by cars (if she refused to do so).</a></p><a id="p1_71-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_72">72&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of Ng’s history of poor compliance with court orders, and taking reference from the custodial terms previously imposed on Ng for her offences of contravening protection orders under s 65(8) of the Women’s Charter, the prosecution submitted for a custodial term of 6 to 8 weeks’ imprisonment.
