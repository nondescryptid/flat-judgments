For purposes of explaining my decision, I set out briefly the pertinent facts below.</a></p><a id="p1_5"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Statement of Facts </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 6 April 2020 at about 9.50 pm, the Accused dropped off a Grab passenger at Reignwood Hamilton Scotts Condominium located at No. 37 Scotts Road. The victim, one Michael Tay Chin Wah, a 49-year-old male Singapore citizen, was the condominium security guard on duty at that time. He noticed that the accused had driven into the condominium compound without waiting for the entry barrier to be fully lifted, resulting in the vehicle coming into contact with the barrier.</a></p><a id="p1_6"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Accused dropped off the passenger at the drop-off point of the condominium and proceeded to the exit, he was stopped by the victim and got out of the Vehicle. The victim asked for his identity card in order to record his personal particulars to lodge a report with the condominium’s management. The Accused refused to do so as he believed that the Vehicle did not hit the entry barrier and got into a dispute with the victim. The victim called for police assistance. After the police arrived to resolve the dispute, the victim went back to resume his duties whilst the Accused left the condominium.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few hours later, at about 12.10 am on 7 April 2020, the Accused decided to return to the condominium to take a video footage of the entry barrier as proof that he did not damage it in case the condominium management should subsequently file a claim against him. He stopped the Vehicle outside the condominium along Scotts Road and was noticed by the victim who was observing the CCTV screen from inside the guardhouse.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victim went outside the condominium and approached the Vehicle as he recognised the Accused’s car and asked him what he was doing. Whilst the Accused sat inside the Vehicle and the victim stood next to the window beside the driver’s seat, they got into another dispute.</a></p><a id="p1_9"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After arguing with the Accused, the victim walked to the front of the Vehicle to take a photo of the registration plate with his mobile phone. Whilst he was doing so, the Accused intentionally released the Vehicle’s brake so that the Vehicle moved towards the victim, braking to stop it immediately before touching the victim. He did so to indicate to the victim that he intended to leave but stopped the Vehicle when he saw that the victim was not moving away.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victim became upset that the Accused had moved the Vehicle towards him and almost hit him. He did not move and instead raised his mobile phone again to take a photo of the Vehicle. The Accused then released the Vehicle’s brake again, causing the Vehicle to move towards the victim once again. This time, the front bumper of the vehicle hit the victim’s legs, resulting in the victim falling forward onto the bonnet of the vehicle.</a></p><a id="p1_11"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the SOF, the Accused wanted to get out of the Vehicle to speak to the victim but forgot to engage the Vehicle in a “Park” mode. This caused the Vehicle to move forward and hit the victim. After the Vehicle hit the victim, the Accused came out to speak to him. The victim called for police assistance and they argued until the police arrived.</a></p><a id="p1_12"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same day, the victim sought medical attention at Khoo Teck Phuat Hospital (“KTPH”). According to the medical report dated 29 April 2020 prepared by resident physician Dr Francesca Thng, the victim sustained lower limb muscle sprain secondary to accident and was given five days’ hospitalisation leave.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused was thereby charged for committing an act so negligently as to endanger the personal safety of the victim under s 336(b) of the Penal Code.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prosecution’s Sentencing Position</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Custodial Threshold Crossed</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution sought a short custodial term for the Accused, leaving the exact length of the sentence to the Court. It was submitted that a negligent offender was less culpable than a rash offence, as reflected in the lower maximum prescribed punishment for the offence under s 336(b) than for s 336(a) of the Penal Code.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was submitted that the facts in <em>PP v Yap Wei Jun Raymond </em></a><em><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/63564-M.xml')">[2009] SGMC 12</a></em> (“<em>Raymond Yap</em>”) were the most similar to the present facts amongst very few cases involving s 336 of the Penal Code, except that the offence in <em>Raymond Yap</em> was one under s 336(a), which entailed a different level of culpability where the harm caused was more serious. It was submitted that the custodial threshold was crossed in this case because whilst the actual harm caused was low, the potential harm that could be caused by such negligent acts was higher. Further, the Accused had relevant antecedents under the Road Traffic Act 1961 (“Road Traffic Act”) necessitating specific deterrence. The Prosecution urged the Court to consider the present case as one of road rage because the facts showed that the offence was committed by the Accused from a dispute with the victim arising from common road use, although it varies from most other road rage cases whereby the accused persons had deliberately used their vehicles to cause alarm or hurt to other persons.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigation Plea by Defence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Nature of the Offence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence submitted for a fine of $500 on the basis that the starting point for an offence under s 336(b) of the Penal Code should be a fine as it was not a serious offence. Based on the case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Lim Choon Teck </em></a><em><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18238-SSP.xml')">[2015] 5 SLR 1395</a></em>, the culpability of the Accused fell within the lower end of the spectrum in relation to an offence under 336(b). Further, it was contended that this was not a road rage offence and that the Accused’s drink driving antecedents were unrelated and should not be given any weight.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defence Counsel explained that for the Accused, it was a “momentary error of judgment after a long day at work” as he had been working as a Grab driver the entire day. The injuries suffered by the victim were very minor and there had been “no high degree of danger of risk to personal safety”. The Accused realised that he had forgotten to engage the “Park” mode on his vehicle “almost immediately” and did so immediately. It was pointed out that the victim had reacted in an unnecessarily rude and provocative manner whilst gesturing at the Accused.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defence Counsel argued that this was not a case of road rage as the alleged act of “violence” committed by the Accused stemmed from events which happened at the car park gantry when the security guard was not a road user at the material time. In other words, it did not occur as a result of shared road use and hence the custodial threshold had not been crossed.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Accused’s Personal and Family Circumstances</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was submitted that the Accused has a 7-year-old daughter whom he has to tend to everyday by fetching her to school and taking care of her meals, as his wife was also working. Sending the Accused to prison would therefore cause hardship to the family, including financial hardship when the Accused can no longer afford to pay the family’s bills. The Defence urged the Court that it would not be in the public interest to do so.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence also submitted that the last two years had been mentally exhausting for the Accused, who was genuinely remorseful for his actions. He had sought to reimburse the victim for medical bills but was informed that the victim no longer had the invoices.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentence Sought by the Defence </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defence counsel sought a fine of $500.00 against the Accused.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentencing Considerations </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S 336 of the Penal Code provides that:</a></p><a id="p1_23"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whoever does any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life or the personal safety of others, shall be punished —</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the case of a rash act, with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 6 months, or with fine which may extend to $2,500, or with both; or</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the case of a negligent act, with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 months, or with fine which may extend to $1,500, or with both.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slightly higher maximum sentences under the “rash” and “negligent” limbs of s 336 is reflective of legislative intent for negligent act offences under the provision to be regarded as less serious than rash ones. This is in line with the significantly higher sentencing tariffs under s 304A of the Penal Code for “rash act” offences and the post-2008 bifurcation of both limbs under the same provision. Having charged the Accused for committing a “negligent” act so as to endanger the personal safety of others under sub-section (b) instead of a “rash” act under sub-section (a), it was clear that the Prosecution had already taken into account the context in which the offence arose. Where the Accused’s negligent act fell within the prescribed range of sentences depended on the existing mitigating and aggravating factors presented in facts of the case.</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Prosecution and the Defence submitted that there was a dearth of case precedents for offences under s 336(b) of the Penal Code. However, it would be appropriate to take guidance from the commentary on the distinct sentencing regimes for rash and negligent acts under s 337 of the Penal Code in the <em>Practitioner’s Library – Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (Third Edition)</em> at page 316 which states that:</a></p><a id="p1_25"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">These offences encompass a wide range of criminal behaviour, and the range of sentences is accordingly broad. In sentencing, the material considerations would be whether the act falls within the negligence or rashness limb and the consequences of the act. The traditional view has been that a term of custody would be appropriate where the act falls under the rashness limb and a fine where the act falls under the negligence limb; see <em>Ngian Chin Boon v PP [1998] 3 SLR® 655</em>…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Given that the sections have now been amended to provide specifically for imprisonment and fines under each limb, such a fact-based approach to sentencing should henceforth be taken. <b>Courts should no longer feel constrained to take fines for negligence and imprisonment for rashness as the starting point</b>. [emphasis mine]</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, whether the case was one of road rage, the extent of the Accused’s negligence, the injury suffered by the victim, the Accused’s antecedent record and plea of guilt would be relevant factors to consider in deciding on the appropriate sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_26"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether this was a case of “Road Rage” </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was this a case of road rage? In the case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Lim Yee Hua </em></a><em><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21080-SSP.xml')">[2017] SGHC 308</a> (“Lim Yee Hua”)</em>, Chan J held on appeal that:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my view, an incident of violence should be labelled as an episode of road rage violence only where the facts disclose violence perpetrated by road users as a result of real or perceived slights by other road users stemming from differences that arise in the course of the shared use of our roads. The litmus test for whether the deterrent sentencing policy associated with road rage offences should apply for a particular offence of violence is thus whether the violence originates from differences arising through common road use. In other words, the harsh deterrent sanctions for road rage incidents only apply when road users engage in violence specifically over disputes that arise from the shared use of our roads. It follows that where incidents of violence happen to break out on the roads, but the cause of the violence has no nexus to the parties’ shared use of the roads, the road rage deterrent sentencing policy should not&nbsp;apply.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution submitted that although this case varied from most road rage cases whereby the accused persons used their vehicles to cause alarm or hurt to the other party, it should still be regarded as a road rage case warranting a deterrence sentence because the altercation between the Accused and the victim stemmed from disputes arising from common road use.</a></p><a id="p1_28"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence, on the other hand, contended that the victim, who was the security guard, was not a “road user” at the time when parties had a dispute at the car park gantry, and hence the case could not be classified as one of road rage warranting a custodial sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_29"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering the facts of the case, I noted that the sequence of events unfolded in two parts a few hours apart from each other. In the first occurring at around 9.50pm on 6 April 2020, the Accused and the victim started arguing with each other when the Accused’s vehicle was alleged to have hit the condominium’s entry barrier when he drove into the compound. As the security guard overseeing the gantry, it was the victim’s job to confront the Accused when he perceived that an accident, no matter how slight, had occurred in which some damage may have been caused to condominium property. The argument arose in part because the Accused had refused to provide his personal particulars to the victim when so requested and the victim had to call for police assistance when the argument continued. The second part of the events occurred just past midnight, shortly before 12.10am on 7 April 2020, when the Accused returned to the condominium intending to take photographs of the gantry. He was in the Vehicle, which was at first stationary outside the condominium compound when the victim walked out from the guardhouse to speak to him, before he released the brakes and stepped on them again in order to signal the victim to move away, and finally releasing the brakes again without engaging it in “park” mode.</a></p><a id="p1_30"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taken together, I am of the view that this case can be classified as a road rage offence in that it took place as a result of a dispute resulting from shared road use, even though the facts were atypical of the usual road rages offences. During the time when the Accused had moved his vehicle towards the victim, the victim was standing along a public road and in the midst of raising his mobile phone in order to take a photograph of the Vehicle and registration plate. The Accused chose this moment to inch forward as a way to indicate his intentions to drive away, stopping the Vehicle just before it hit the victim. As observed by Chan J in <em>Lim Yee Hua</em> at [30], “…whether or not a particular incident of road rage violence crosses the custodial threshold is ultimately a fact-specific enquiry.”</a></p><a id="p1_31"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Culpability of the Accused </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acts of road rage can take place in different forms, each potentially giving rise to different offences. In the case where the Accused does so whilst the victim was in another vehicle, it may well be argued that the potential harm that may be cause to the victim was relatively contained. But where the victim was standing directly in front of the Accused’s vehicle in person, the potential harm takes on a much-aggravated texture. An automobile is an inherently dangerous object capable of inflicting serious harm even at low speed due to its sheer size and mass. In this case, the Accused had set the Vehicle in motion towards the victim when the latter raised his phone camera to take a picture of the Accused’s car registration plate, braking just before it hit the victim. He inched forward in an attempt to use his vehicle to signal to the victim to move away as he wanted to drive off, stopping only when he realised that the victim refused to move. When the victim, angry at the Accused’s action, then raised his phone again to take a photograph of the Accused’s car registration plate, the Accused once again released his brakes, causing his vehicle to move towards the victim. These were inherently dangerous manoeuvres. Attempting to use a vehicle to get someone to move out of the way by inching it forward when the latter was standing just a very short distance away would be to bear a high risk that harm may inadvertently be inflicted on the person.</a></p><a id="p1_32"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first instance, the Accused’s act of setting the Vehicle in motion while the victim raised his mobile phone to take a photograph of the Vehicle and car registration plate was done deliberately, especially since he braked only immediately in front of the victim. By releasing the brakes again when the victim once again attempted to take a photograph of the Vehicle crystalised the risk when harm to the victim did materialise. After releasing his brakes for the second time, the Accused “forgot” to put it back into park-mode when he wanted to alight from his car to speak to the victim, causing the vehicle to hit the victim’s legs. The Vehicle must have been so close to the victim that this “momentary lapse” was sufficient to cause the victim to fall forward onto the car bonnet from the impact of the Vehicle, even when the Accused realised it and engaged the car brakes almost immediately. The victim was found to have sustained lower limb muscle sprain secondary to accident and was given 5 days’ hospitalisation leave. It was fortuitous that the victim did not suffer more serious injuries, but this cannot be credited to the Accused.</a></p><a id="p1_33"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Precedent Cases Submitted</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution submitted that the case of <em>Raymond Yap</em> was similar to the present case, except that it involved a charge under s 336(a) of the Penal Code rather than one under s 336(b). <em>Raymond Yap</em> was a case that similarly involved a security guard carrying out his duties. Whilst he was squatting down to clamp the wheels of the accused’s vehicle about six inches away from the vehicle’s front wheels, the accused drove off rashly in a fashion towards the wheel clamp to prevent his car from being clamped and without giving due care and consideration to the safety of the victim. In the process, the front wheel, front fender and front right door of the accused’s vehicle was damaged. The victim sustained a 5 x 2.5cm bruise over the volar aspect of his right wrist, a 2 x 1.5cm faint bruise on the radial aspect of his right wrist and 1mm scabs in the right anterior lower leg. He was given 7 days’ medical leave and was assessed by the Institute of Mental Health as having suffered an acute situational reaction to the incident. The accused was sentenced to 3 weeks’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_34"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst I agree that the facts in <em>Raymond Yap</em> and the present case are rather similar in that they involved security guards carrying out their duties, they can nonetheless be easily distinguished on the basis of the manner in which the offences were carried out and the <em>mens rea</em> of the accused persons concerned. The victim in <em>Raymond Yap</em> also suffered slightly more serious injuries than the victim in the present case.</a></p><a id="p1_35"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Use of the Vehicle by the Accused </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, it was undisputed that the Accused failed to apply the brakes to the Vehicle when he wanted to alight from it to speak to the victim because he had forgotten to do so, unlike in <em>Raymond Yap’s</em> case where the accused had deliberately driven off whilst the victim was in the process of wheel clamping his vehicle. However, the Accused was fully culpable because he had purposely moved the Vehicle so close to the victim that by merely forgetting to apply his brakes for a moment, it would hit the victim and cause him to fall. The Accused was the one who had set the stage for his own error by creating what can only be called “an accident waiting to happen”.</a></p><a id="p1_36"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As explained above, the act of moving a vehicle forward to signal one’s intentions to drive away is highly dangerous when a human being is standing a very short distance directly in front of the vehicle. There are plenty of other less egregious methods for the Accused to express that he wished to drive away but he chose the most precarious one. It would therefore not be open for the Accused to claim that the charge for which he faced under s 336(b) of the Penal Code was not a serious one or that his actions were merely due to a momentary lapse of judgment or that the injury suffered by the victim was minor.</a></p><a id="p1_37"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that the custodial threshold was crossed in this case and that a nominal fine of $500 as submitted by the Defence would be wholly inappropriate in this case. Whilst the actual harm caused to the victim was low in this case, the potential harm that the Accused’s actions could have caused was much higher.</a></p><a id="p1_38"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Aggravating and Mitigating Factors</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the aggravating factor of potential harm that the Accused’s acts could cause, the Accused also had road traffic-related antecedents. The Accused was convicted twice of drink driving under s 67(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act on 9 April 2001 and 28 April 2005. He had also been convicted of one count under s 35(1) of the Road Traffic Act on 29 March 2011. I disagree with the Defence that these are unrelated antecedents which should not be given weight. The Accused’s previous convictions under the Road Traffic Act evinces a person who was prone to driving or using his vehicle carelessly, warranting specific deterrence in sentencing.</a></p><a id="p1_39"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a><a id="p1_40">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of mitigation, the only factor of some value would be the Accused’s plea of guilt, which reflected his remorse over the incident. The Accused produced no evidence to support his claim that a short imprisonment term will mean that his family’s monthly financial obligations cannot be met, leading to hardship, or that it will prevent him from continuing to tend to his daughter’s daily needs. However, I noted that the victim may also have overreacted in this case, going beyond his duty in keeping peace and security within the condominium compound by confronting the Accused when he returned to the condominium a few hours after the gantry incident intending to take pictures of the entry barrier.</a></p><a id="p1_40"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a><a id="p1_41">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having considered fully the facts of this case, I sentenced the Accused to a short custodial term of 5 days’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_41"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a><a id="p1_42">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being dissatisfied with the sentence imposed, the Accused has now appeal against my decision.</a></p><a id="p1_42"> </a></div></content></html>
