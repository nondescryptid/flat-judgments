The Accused had used his Twitter account “@Scarletbitchhh” wherein he had posed as a seductive female. He had offered nude videos of “herself” and also a chance to meet up for sex. The victims fell into his trap and paid him various sums of money.</a></p><a id="p1_1"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The charges</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four charges against the Accused were for cheating under s 417 Penal Code. The Accused had pretended to be a female in the Twitter account “@Scarletbitchhhh”. He had placed advertisements on “@Scarletbitchhhh” listing out videos of a nude woman. He represented that he was the woman featured in the videos. In the advertisements, he had offered these videos for sale for $500, and in addition to that, a chance to meet up with “her” ie, the woman in the videos. The “meet up” was euphemism for sexual services. Pursuant to the deception, he induced the victims into transferring money into his DBS Bank PayLah account.</a></p><a id="p1_2"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_2-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>DAC-925787-2021</u>: The victim was one Muhammad Iskandar (“Iskandar”). On or about 4 June 2021, Iskandar, enticed by the Accused’s advertisement, sent a private message to “@Scarletbitchhhh” saying that he was interested in engaging the Accused’s sexual services for two hours. For this purpose, he transferred $500 to the Accused. Subsequently, the Accused kept giving excuses when Iskandar sent repeated messages requesting for the “meet up”. Eventually the Accused blocked Iskandar from Twitter and Telegram and became uncontactable.</a></p><a id="p1_2-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_2-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>DAC-925788-2021</u>: The victim was Nazhif Bin Jamal (“Nazhif”). On 17 June 2021, Nazhif sent a private message to “@Scarletbitchhhh” asking how he could purchase the videos. The Accused replied saying that if Nazhif prchased all the videos for $500, they could “meet up”. Nazhif understood the phrase “meet up” to mean meet up for sex. Nazhif agreed and transferred $500 to the Accused. When Nazhif subsequently messaged requesting for the promised “meet up”, the Accused gave various excuses, <em>inter alia</em>, that “she” had contracted STD and would take a while to recover.</a></p><a id="p1_2-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_2-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>DAC-925789-2021</u>: On or about 19 June 2021, Nazhif again asked for the “meet up”. In the exchange of messages, the Accused had further deceived him into transferring $30 as payment for a sexually explicit video of “herself”. Subsequently, all of Nazhif’s chat messages in “@Scarletbitchhhh” were deleted.</a></p><a id="p1_2-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_2-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>DAC-925790-2021</u>: The victim was one Jeremy Gan (“Gan”). On or about 29 July 2021, Gan responded to the Accused’s advertisement. After some haggling, Gan agreed to pay the $500 for “her” sexual services. He transferred $300 to the Accused as a deposit for the sexual meeting. The balance $200 was to be paid afterwards. After the transfer, Gan proceeded to an address in Ang Mo Kio that the Accused had given to him. The address was a random address which the Accused had pulled out from Google. Gan waited at the said address for about 50 minutes. He realised that he had been cheated when no one showed up. The Accused had also become uncontactable and had blocked Gan on Twitter thereafter.</a></p><a id="p1_2-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, the Accused deactivated the “@Scarletbitchhhh” account when Twitter posts were made that the said account was committing scams.

He highlighted the sentences meted out in <em>Idya Nurhazlyn</em> and <em>PP v Lim Zu Er</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18879-SSP.xml')">[2016] SGDC 127</a> (“<em>Lim Zu Er</em>”), to show that the sentences which he had now proposed were consistent with the case precedents.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, on the issue of concurrent or consecutive sentences, DPP Ngia pointed out that the starting point was that the custodial sentences should run consecutively as the offences were distinct in time and against distinct victims: <em>PP v Raveen Balakrishnan</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22604-SSP.xml')">[2018] 5 SLR 799</a> (“<em>Raveen</em>”). However, in consideration of the totality principle, he submitted that a global sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment (with two sentences to run consecutively) and a fine was commensurate with the level of criminality, and the aggravating and mitigating factors present.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The mitigation plea</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ashwin tendered a written mitigation plea on the Accused’s behalf. He set out the Accused’s personal circumstances which were as follows –</a></p><a id="p1_11"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_11-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was currently 23 years old. He was working as a GrabFood deliveryman earning about $1,500 per month. He was from a single parent family background, and he supported himself and his mother. He shared a close bond with his mother and her long-time partner.</a></p><a id="p1_11-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_11-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was only 21 years old when he committed the offences. He was also a first offender. He was very remorseful for his actions. He had not reoffended since his arrest. He has a good future and could certainly benefit if given a second chance. He had a Diploma in Digital Marketing from Nanyang Polytechnic. He intended to pursue further education in Computer Science at the Singapore Institute of Management University. His plan had been put on hold because of the case.</a></p><a id="p1_11-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_11-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had expressed genuine remorse and contrition evidenced by his utmost cooperation with the authorities and admission of his guilt. He had tendered letters of apologies to his victims. He had also expressed his willingness to make full restitution to his victims, and in that regard, he gave his consent to release the monies in his bank account, which had been seized and frozen by the Police, for restitution.</a></p><a id="p1_11-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ashwin submitted that the offences fell into the low harm and low culpability category. The total amount involved was $1,330 which was low. The harm caused was also markedly reduced by the fact that the victims would be fully compensated for their loss. Mr Ashwin also described the offences as opportunistic in nature ie committed in a moment of folly, and premeditated or planned. They were also rudimentary in nature, and not sophisticated at all. Mr Ashwin submitted that the case fell into the lowest end of the seriousness spectrum.</a></p><a id="p1_12"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the above reasons, Mr Ashwin submitted that custodial sentences were wholly disproportionate to the overall criminality especially given the Accused’s age at the time of the offences and the mitigating factors that were present. The Accused was only 21 years old when he committed the offences, Therefore, rehabilitation has equal consideration alongside deterrence. In this regard, fines would meet the ends of justice.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the Court was minded that a custodial sentence was warranted, Mr Ashwin made the alternative submission for a Short Detention Order (“SDO”) of seven days which he argued would achieve the twin aims of deterrence and rehabilitation. This was on the basis that a SDO sentence carried a punitive element and as such was inherently capable of serving to deter the Accused.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The sentence by the court</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offences in this case were cheating under s 417 of the Penal Code. Such offences generally fell into the category of serious offences. The level of seriousness was enhanced by the use of the internet to commit them. It therefore followed that the dominant sentencing principle was deterrence. There was a strong public interest to deter potential offenders from using the medium of the internet to commit offences: <em>Syamsul Hilal</em> at [36]. In using the internet to perpetrate the crimes, the Accused had been able to reach a larger number of potential victims, whilst protected by the cloak of anonymity offered by the internet which made detection very difficult. It was also trite law that deterrence was the dominant consideration for cheating offences so long as the victims were caused to part with property that has more than a negligible value and where the motive was for financial gain: <em>Idya Nurhazlyn</em> at [47]. In this case, the Accused obtained amounts that ranged from $30 to $500. By his own admission, he had committed the offences to earn quick cash for himself.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I disagreed with the defence’s submission that the offences fell at the lowest end of the seriousness spectrum. The offences were committed with premeditation and planning, in that, it was not opportunistic in nature or committed in the spur of the moment. He had represented himself as a seductive female, posted various videos of female bodies (presumably obtained from somewhere within the bowels of the internet), and deceived his victims into believing that the female in these videos was his seductive female persona. These were what one would call the bait. His fishing rod was Twitter where he dangled the bait to entice his potential victims. I disagreed that the whole scheme was rudimentary but that there was a certain degree of sophistication and planning involved. In this manner, he had committed multiple offences, including duping the same victim twice. After he realised that the authorities were investigating into his scamming activity, he took immediate steps to try and avoid detection.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I did not accept the defence’s submission that rehabilitation should be placed on equal footing with deterrence as a sentencing consideration. I agreed that in certain cases, as a starting point, rehabilitation would be the dominant sentencing consideration. An example would be where the offender was below 21 years old at the time of the offences, and the offences committed were minor or of low severity. The circumstances in the present case were wholly different. The Accused was clearly an adult offender. He was 21 years old when he committed the first three offences and was 22 years old when he committed the fourth offence. As set out above, these offences that he committed were serious offences. Internet scams were highly prevalent and posed a serious threat to the general public. They were also highly profitable given the huge sums of money that the scammers had fleeced from their victims. It was also common knowledge that despite the authorities’ best efforts, these scams continued to proliferate, which was proof of the difficulty in detection and apprehension</a></p><a id="p1_17"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, for the sentences to have any meaningful deterrent effect, custodial sentences were warranted. The imposition of fines – even high fines - would be wholly inadequate and incapable of serving to effectively deter the Accused and other like-minded offenders. Given the difficulty in detection and apprehension, and the lucrative nature of these scams, a like-minded offender might think that it was an acceptable “business” risk to take, if he thought that he could get away with fines, if caught.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having determined that the appropriate sentence was imprisonment, I now move to consider whether SDO was an appropriate substitute for or an alternative to imprisonment. I agreed that SDO has a punitive element and was inherently capable of serving to deter. SDO, to all intends and purposes, was imprisonment but without the stigma of a criminal record, upon successful completion of the sentence. However, we should not lose sight of the fact that SDO, like the other community-based sentences, were essentially targeted at “offences and offenders traditionally viewed by the courts to be on the rehabilitation end of the spectrum”. These offences would include regulatory offences or minor offences. The offenders would include younger offenders, mainly those below 21 years old, and/or offenders with specific or minor mental conditions: <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (18 May 2010) vol 87 at col 422, (K Shanmugam, Minister for Law and Second Minister for Home Affairs)</em>. The Accused and the offences he had committed did not fall into these categories.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ashwin had cited the case of <em>PP v Teo Chang Heng</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21708-SSP.xml')">[2018] 3 SLR 1163</a> (“<em>Teo Chang Heng</em>”), to support his submission for SDO. The offender in <em>Teo Chang Heng</em> was charged with mischief under s 426 Penal Code. At the time of the offence, he was separated from his spouse but he was hopeful for a reconciliation. He had chanced upon his spouse’s boyfriend driving his spouse’s car. Consumed by anger and frustration, he followed and tailgated the car. He rear-ended the car when he could not stop in time. He then drove past his spouse’s car and side-swiped it. After that he proceeded to make two U-turns as he saw that the boyfriend had stopped the car at the side of the road, stepped out onto the pavement and stood away from the car. The offender then collided into the car from the rear again, causing the front left wheel to mount the kerb. The district judge imposed a 10-day SDO and 120 hours community service order (“CSO”). The prosecution appealed, seeking two weeks’ imprisonment instead. See Kee Oon J dismissed the prosecution’s appeal.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See J found that the two community-based sentences (“CBS”) were appropriate in the case. His reasons for this finding were –</a></p><a id="p1_21"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_21-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts of the case were unusual and quite exceptional. The offender had snapped and acted rashly, and impulsively in hot blood and without actual planning and premeditation. His aggression was targeted mostly if not primarily at the car. He had not vented his anger or frustration on the boyfriend or on other random road users. Apart from the facts pertaining to the offence, there was no evidence that he had driven dangerously or recklessly. He had also not driven very fast when he rear-ended the car.</a></p><a id="p1_21-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_21-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately thereafter, he sought to atone for his actions by calling the police and surrendering himself. He had remained at the scene until the police arrived. This act was demonstrably spontaneous and reflected genuine remorse and palpable contrition. It was a strong indication of his potential for rehabilitation and reintegration into society. He had remained married to his spouse and she had agreed for the charge to be withdrawn and had forgiven him.</a></p><a id="p1_21-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_21-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offence of mischief was not a particularly grave offence and was among the class of offences for which CBS options could be properly considered.</a></p><a id="p1_21-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, the circumstances of the case above were significantly different from the Accused’s case. <em>Teo Chang Heng</em> was wholly distinguishable as its facts were unusual and possibly quite exceptional. The offence was spontaneous, committed in an impulsive moment. This was borne out by his actions when he committed the offence, and also by the fact that he had thereafter immediately called for the police and waited for them to arrive and surrendered himself. The offence of mischief was also a minor offence. The same could not be said for cheating under s 417 Penal Code. As such, I found that SDO was wholly inappropriate in this case.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the case of <em>Lim Zu Er</em> cited by DPP Ngia serves as a more useful guide in determining the appropriate sentence. <em>Lim Zu Er</em> involved an internet scam. The offender in that case had pleaded guilty to three charges of cheating under s 420 Penal Code. He had carried out a scam on Carousell. In this way, he had cheated his victims sums ranging between $540 to $750 for items which he had advertised on Carousell but did not intend to deliver. He was sentenced to 10 weeks’ imprisonment on each charge. In <em>Idya Nurhazlyn</em>, the offender was sentenced to one month’s imprisonment for one charge under s 417 Penal Code for cheating her relatives into delivering to her $1,800. It should be noted that this case did not involve an internet scam. Full restitution was made.
