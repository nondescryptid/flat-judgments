J-mart’s employee, Ms Cheah Pei San<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> (“Ms Cheah”) confirmed that the cup noodles were the same as those in the photograph.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accepted Ms Cheah’s evidence. Ms Cheah testified that from J-mart’s CCTV footage,<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a> the Accused had placed the cup noodles into his bag. The Accused had been holding onto the cup noodles, before making an action, which caused the cup noodles to no longer be in his hand. Essentially, he had opened his bag and put the cup noodles inside his bag.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Cheah stated that one cup noodles were missing from J-mart. She confirmed that the cup noodles belonged to J-mart, which had its own label and bar code on its items.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I accepted the eye-witness account of Sgt Ong.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a> Sgt Ong was a police officer who was off-duty on 17 June 2022 at or about 8pm+. When Sgt Ong was inside J-mart, she saw the Accused place something white, which was the bottom part of the cup noodles, into his bag. He exited J-mart abruptly without paying for the cup noodles.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused brought the cup noodles outside I12 Katong Shopping Mall. The cup noodles dropped onto the ground, which can also be seen in the video.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a> When Sgt Ong pointed to the cup noodles and asked the Accused whether he had taken the cup noodles, the Accused nodded his head.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accepted Sgt Ong’s evidence. She did not know the Accused prior to the incident and she had no reason to lie in her court testimony. Sgt Ong did not exaggerate or embellish her evidence. For instance, she repeatedly stated that she saw the Accused holding something “white”, which was then placed into his bag inside J-mart.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the opportunity to observe Sgt Ong’s demeanour in court. She testified in a matter-of-fact manner without any reservation and was forthright when giving evidence.&nbsp; I found her testimony to be credible, cogent, and consistent in the material aspects.&nbsp; Her testimony withstood the defence’s cross-examination. Her testimony had the ring of truth.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, I accepted Sergeant Tan Jun Jie’s<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a> testimony (“Sgt Tan”). The Accused admitted to Sgt Tan that he had taken the cup noodles and he had no receipt for them. Sgt Tan searched the Accused’s bag and retrieved the cup noodles from his bag and brought it to J-mart.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I accepted the evidence of another eye-witness, Mr Chng Cai Yuan Samuel.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a> Mr Chng testified that the Accused was trying to escape — when Sgt Ong asked the Accused to stay put for further investigations, he continued to move away. This was consistent with the evidence of two other eye-witnesses:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistant Superintendent of Police Amanda Chong Kai Shi,<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a> who testified that the Accused was trying to run away from Sgt Ong, and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sng May Yen (“DAC Sng”),<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a> who testified that the Accused was trying to walk away from the scene.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 2: Did the Accused hit Sergeant Ong’s left ear?</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All told, I found that the Accused had hit Sgt Ong’s left ear. I accepted Sgt Ong’s testimony. Sgt Ong’s evidence was supported by a photograph<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a> showing redness on her left ear.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sgt Ong saw the Accused exiting J-mart with the cup noodles in his bag, the Accused noticed that Sgt Ong was looking at him. The Accused started climbing up an escalator. When he approached the top of the escalator, Sgt Ong and her friend, Ms Jeslyn See Suay Kee (“Ms See”),<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a> started to give chase.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Accused was walking relatively fast, Sgt Ong sprinted towards him. She asked him whether she could verify the contents in his bag. The Accused asked why he had to show her his bag and asked for her identity.</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sgt Ong told him that she was an off-duty police officer (undisputed by the Accused). When the Accused heard that, he repeated that she was an off-duty officer and swung his right hand and hit Sgt Ong on her left ear area and temple area. Sgt Ong described it as being like a slap from his palm, which was large enough to hit both her left ear area and temple area. Sgt Ong felt pain for a while. After that pain subsided, it felt like a bruise.</a></p><a id="p1_25"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sgt Ong’s testimony was corroborated by Ms See. Ms See testified that she saw the Accused swing his arm and she heard a loud smack when Sgt Ong was hit on the face. Due to this loud smack, Ms See held onto the Accused by pulling his T-shirt. I accepted Ms See’s evidence.</a></p><a id="p1_26"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not accept that the Accused slapped Sgt Ong because his T-shirt was pulled. In so far as the Accused was raising the right of private defence vis-à-vis the pulling of his T-shirt, I agreed with the Prosecution that the right of private defence did not arise on the present facts.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a> Amongst other things, s 106A(1) of the Penal Code states that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is no right of private defence against an act which does not cause the defender to reasonably believe that death or grievous hurt would result, if done, or attempted to be done, by a public servant acting in good faith under the actual or apparent authority of his office, though that act may not be strictly justifiable by law.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sgt Ong testified that prior to the slap, while she had verbally identified herself as a police officer, she did not have the opportunity to reach for and bring out her police pass as it was inside her backpack. Subsequently, DAC Sng<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a> saw Sgt Ong flash her police pass and identify herself as a police officer to the Accused. This was consistent with the Accused’s own statement to the police, where he stated that “When I left the J-Mart, I was stopped by 2 women. One of them identified herself as a police officer by showing me her warrant card”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I paused to consider whether Sgt Ong, being an <em>off-duty</em> police officer, was lawfully discharging her duty as such public servant. The answer was “Yes”. Sgt Ong had identified herself as a police officer to the Accused and she had asked him about the item he had stolen from J-mart. I agreed with the Prosecution’s closing submissions at [17(b)], where they stated:</a></p><a id="p1_29"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">While she was off-duty on that day, Sgt Ong gave evidence that she was vested with the power, even while off-duty, to detect crime and detain an offender. This is supported by s 23 of the Police Force Act 2004 which states: “Every police officer is, for the purposes of this Act, deemed to be always on duty when required to act as such and has to perform the duties and exercise the powers granted to him or her under this Act or any other written law at any time and every place where he or she may be doing duty.”</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the incident, there was a scuffle between the Accused, Sgt Ong and Ms See.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a> Sgt Ong asked passers-by for help in calling the police as the Accused had stolen something. The Accused pushed Sgt Ong, who landed on her back in the bushes.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> Sgt Ong grabbed the Accused who also landed in the bushes.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day of the incident, Sgt Ong informed Sergeant Sharkhan bin Mohd Hanafi<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a> that her left ear was injured. Based on the totality of the evidence, I did not accept the Accused’s claim that Sgt Ong’s injury to her left ear area was caused by the bushes’ thorns. It was unlikely that thorns would cause redness on the left ear.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accepted Sgt Ong’s evidence that she had sustained other injuries after being pushed into the bushes by the Accused. In this regard, the medical report<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a> listed the following injuries:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7cm vertical scratch of left forearm.</a></p><a id="p1_32-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_32-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abrasion over left hand.</a></p><a id="p1_32-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_32-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruise over right upper arm with scratches.</a></p><a id="p1_32-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_32-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superficial abrasion at right forearm.</a></p><a id="p1_32-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_32-p2_e">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3cm superficial scratch at left ankle.</a></p><a id="p1_32-p2_e"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_e"></a><a id="p1_32-p2_f">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abrasion over right ankle.</a></p><a id="p1_32-p2_f"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32-p2_f"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accepted the evidence of the prosecution witnesses for the following reasons:</a></p><a id="p1_33"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33"></a><a id="p1_33-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the prosecution witnesses, including the eye-witnesses and/ or police officers, knew the Accused prior to the incident.
