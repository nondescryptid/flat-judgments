The payment was made towards the tail-end of his employment with the Claimant.

According to this clause, an employee would not be eligible for the variable incentive if he is serving his notice period in the same month that the variable incentive is declared and/or paid. The relevant portion of clause 3.3.3 is reproduced as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_2"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Generally, employees are not eligible for pay-out of variable incentive if … the employee is serving his/her notice period on the date/month that any of the incentives is declared and/or paid.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is undisputed that the Defendant was serving his notice period in the same month as when the payment was made.

Clause 9 states that:</a></p><a id="p1_8"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">You will enjoy such benefits and be subject to such further terms as laid down in the prevailing Employee Handbook or elsewhere and the Company expressly reserves, subject to the exclusive right and sole discretion to change such benefits and terms at any time hereafter. …</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Claimant further submitted that the Defendant was aware of the existence of the Employee Handbook.</a></p><a id="p1_9"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the interpretation of clause 3.3.3, the Defendant submitted that it does not give the Claimant a right to claw back the variable incentive after it has already been paid out. The Claimant originally took the position that clause 3.3.3 entitled it to do so, because it operated as a “condition subsequent”. As I will elaborate below, it subsequently took a different view and sought to rely on a different clause in its closing submissions.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Discussion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two main issues arose from the parties’ originally pleaded case and submissions:</a></p><a id="p1_11"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_11-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the Employee Handbook incorporated into the employment contract?</a></p><a id="p1_11-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_11-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Claimant contractually entitled to claw back the variable incentive?</a></p><a id="p1_11-p2_b"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was the Employee Handbook incorporated into the employment contract?</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that the Employee Handbook was incorporated into his employment contract by reference pursuant to clause 9 of the Employment Letter. Clause 9 expressly states that the Defendant would be “subject to such further terms as laid down in the prevailing Employee Handbook”. It would be apparent from this that the terms of his employment contract may not be exhaustively set out in the Employment Letter and that the Defendant could be subject to further terms as set out in the prevailing Employee Handbook.</a></p><a id="p1_12"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 is essentially an express incorporation clause. It seeks to incorporate the terms of the Employee Handbook into the employment contract. Terms incorporated by reference are valid and binding even though they are not reproduced within the four corners of the contract (<em>Press Automation Technology Pte Ltd v Trans-Link Exhibition Forwarding Pte Ltd</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2003] 1 SLR(R) 0712.xml')">[2003] 1 SLR(R) 712</a> (“<em>Press Automation</em>”) at [39]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant claimed that he was unaware of clause 3.3.3 of the Employee Handbook. He submitted that the Claimant should have drawn his attention to what he deemed as an onerous clause. I am unable to accept this argument for several reasons.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the effect of incorporation clauses is such that the terms being incorporated form part of the contract notwithstanding that one party did not have a copy of such terms or had not read them (<em>Press Automation</em> at [39]). The law places the onus on the party signing the contract to request for a copy of the conditions sought to be incorporated by reference (<em>Bintai Kindenko Pte Ltd v Samsung C&amp;T Corp and another</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23479-SSP.xml')">[2019] 2 SLR 295</a> (“<em>Bintai</em>”) at [62]). As the court in <em>Bintai</em> held, if it “signed the contract without doing so, then it had to bear the risks and the consequences of its omission”. Having signed and accepted the contract, the signatory cannot seek to disclaim knowledge of those terms at the time of contract (<em>Bintai</em> at [63]). Further, the court in <em>Bintai</em> endorsed the holding in <em>Press Automation</em> that there is no need for the other contracting party to draw the attention of the party sought to be bound to onerous and unusual conditions (at [60]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, and in any event, the fact of that matter is that the Claimant was aware of the existence of the Employee Handbook. This is not a case where a contracting party was blindsided by an incorporation clause and the terms sought to be incorporated. In this regard:</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_16-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Defendant does not deny knowing about the existence of the Employee Handbook;</a></p><a id="p1_16-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_16-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Defendant testified during trial that a Human Resource (“HR”) staff of the Claimant explained clause 9 of the Employment Letter to the Defendant at the time of contract;</a></p><a id="p1_16-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_16-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by an email dated 9 March 2021, the Claimant informed the Defendant that the latest version of the Employee Handbook was available on the “Public drive”; and</a></p><a id="p1_16-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_16-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by an email dated 23 March 2021, the Claimant informed the Defendant that he has been confirmed as a permanent staff with retrospective effect from 21 March 2021, and with that confirmation, he was now “eligible for the benefits as indicated in the prevailing Employee Handbook”.</a></p><a id="p1_16-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the Defendant testified that he accepted that certain parts of the Employee Handbook were applicable to him. While he said certain parts of the Employee Handbook were not applicable to him, in my view the Defendant cannot cherry-pick contractual provisions, adopting what is favourable (such as being eligibility for annual leave and bonuses), while discarding what is not favourable to him (such as the conditions on which bonuses are to be paid).</a></p><a id="p1_17"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant also claimed that it did not occur to him that the Employee Handbook would spell out the terms on which bonuses are paid. This is because, according to him, the Employment Letter already states that there were two bonuses to be paid out, one in December and the other in March, and therefore there was no need for him to find out what other terms were applicable to the payment of bonuses. Quite apart from the fact that such terms were incorporated by reference, this allegation is misconceived also because the Employment Letter only made a cursory mention of the existence of two tranches of bonuses, without specifying the precise terms on which they would be paid out. The Defendant sought to rely on clause 7 of the Employment Letter, but that reliance is misplaced because that clause merely seeks to inform the prospective employee of his eligibility for the respective tranches of bonuses depending on the time he joins and is confirmed. In this regard, clause 7 states that:</a></p><a id="p1_18"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Staff who joins on or after 1<sup>st</sup> July and is confirmed in his appointment by 31<sup>st</sup> December shall be entitled to pro-rated year-end incentive. There is no entitlement for the pro-rated company bonus pay-out in March of the following year. This is subjected to review and change at the sole discretion of the Management.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Employment Letter is silent on the precise terms on which bonuses are to be paid and retained, the Defendant has no reason to assert that there is no need to look to the Employee Handbook for the provision of these terms.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, I find that the Employee Handbook was incorporated to the employment contract by reference.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Is the Claimant contractually entitled to claw back the variable incentive?</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While contractually incorporated, clause 3.3.3 stops short of requiring the Defendant to refund the payment. It does not expressly state that the Claimant is entitled to claw back the payment.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant takes the position that since clause 3.3.3 does not provide for clawback, the Claimant is not entitled to claw back the payment.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before me, counsel for the Claimant initially took the position that the payment was nevertheless refundable by way of “unjust enrichment” under common law. However, the Claimant did not plead “unjust enrichment” or words to that effect in its Statement of Claim. When I queried whether unjust enrichment has been pleaded, counsel initially submitted that it suffices for facts to be pleaded. I stood down the hearing for the Claimant to tender authorities on whether a case premised on unjust enrichment can survive without the unjust factor having been pleaded. When the hearing resumed, counsel for the Claimant said he was unable to find any. It decided not to proceed with the unjust enrichment cause of action. Instead, it submitted that this was a case that falls with the four corners of a contract. To that end, counsel submitted that clause 3.3.3 was a “condition subsequent” which was breached by the Defendant. At the end of the hearing, I directed the Claimant to tender written submissions and authorities to make good its submission.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I perused Claimant’s written submissions, it was not apparent from the authorities tendered that clause 3.3.3 operated as a “condition subsequent”.</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_24-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Ong Chay Tong &amp; Sons (Pte) Ltd v Ong Hoo Eng</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2009] 1 SLR(R) 0305.xml')">[2009] 1 SLR(R) 305</a>, the Court of Appeal held that the hallmark of a condition subsequent is that “a breach would accord the grantee the right to bring the original contract to an end or to re-enter or forfeit the property”. In that case, the court found that the absence of a right of re-entry and forfeiture or language to the effect of bringing the original contract to an end compelled it to find that the provision in question was not a condition subsequent. In the present case, clause 3.3.3 does not contain language to the effect that the contract would be terminated if it is breached.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Claimant also cited <em>Goh Guan Chong v AspenTech, Inc</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2009] 3 SLR(R) 0590.xml')">[2009] 3 SLR(R) 590</a>, where the court found that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the sign-on bonus from the former employee “on the condition subsequent that he would forfeit his right to the sign-on bonus if he resigned”. The relevant contractual provision stated that “should you leave [the plaintiff] voluntarily during this time period, you will be responsible for payment in full of your sign-on bonus”. In the present case, the payment-back clause is not found in clause 3.3.3.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The payment-back clause is found in a different provision of the employment contract, clause 3.3.4. Clause 3.3.4 provides, amongst others, that:</a></p><a id="p1_25"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Service Retention Period</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Eligible employees who received the incentives (regardless of pay-out cycle) shall continue in their service (the “Service Retention Period”) after the pay-out month to retain the incentive. <em>If the employee resigns during the service retention period, the Company reserves the right to recover the full paid sum of incentive/s (including applicable statutory contributions e.g. CPF) from the employee.</em></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(i) If incentive paid out is less than or equal to two (2) months of salary, service retention period of one (1) month applies.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(ii) If incentive paid out is more than two (2) months of salary, service retention period of two (2) months applies.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Example, when company declares one (1) month bonus paid in March, the employee shall remain in service for one month i.e. until 30 April, before giving notice. However, if employee decides to forego the bonus, he/she can resign in April and the bonus shall then be returned to the Company according to policy.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty for the Claimant is that clause 3.3.4 was neither pleaded nor pursued at trial. In fact, it was the Defendant who identified clause 3.3.4 in his oral closing submissions. When he said the Claimant should be precluded from relying on clause 3.3.4, counsel for the Claimant did not object to that submission.</a></p><a id="p1_26"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Claimant sought to rely on clause 3.3.4 for the first time in its written submissions filed after trial. In its written submissions, the Claimant submitted that clause 3.3.4 imposes a positive obligation on the Defendant to return the variable incentive and the Defendant had breached this provision by failing to return the same. The Claimant submitted that it should not be precluded from relying on this provision since the facts underlying the breach has been sufficiently pleaded and the Defendant suffered no prejudice even though this provision was raised late in the day.</a></p><a id="p1_27"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is trite that contractual provisions, and the alleged breaches thereof, ought to be canvassed in pleadings. The importance of holding parties to their pleaded case is well-documented in our jurisprudence.</a></p><a id="p1_28"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reluctant as I generally am to hear allegations that have not been pleaded, I think the justice of this case leans in favour of allowing the Claimant to pursue clause 3.3.4. The underlying factual premise for the enforcement of that contractual provision have been pleaded, which is that the Defendant was not entitled to retain the variable incentive by reason of his resignation in the same month on which he received the incentive. All the material evidence in support of the Defendant’s ineligibility to retain the incentive have been canvassed at trial. Indeed, the Defendant does not dispute this in his written submissions. No irreparable prejudice that cannot be remedied by costs was also identified in his written submissions, should the Claimant be allowed to pursue clause 3.3.4. As the Court of Appeal held in <em>OMG Holdings Pte Ltd v Pos Ad Sdn Bhd</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 4 SLR 0231.xml')">[2012] 4 SLR 231</a> at [18]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… It is trite law that the court may permit an unpleaded point to be raised if no injustice or prejudice (that cannot be compensated by costs) will be occasioned to the other party (see <em>Lu Bang Song v Teambuild Construction Pte Ltd</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/60971-M.xml')">[2009] SGHC 49</a> (‘<em>Lu Bang Song’</em>) at [17] and <em>Boustead Trading (1985) Sdn Bhd v Arab-Malaysian Merchant Bank Ltd [</em>1995] 3 MLJ 331 (‘<em>Boustead Trading’</em>) at 341–342). In the same vein, evidence given at trial can, where appropriate, overcome defects in the pleadings provided that the other party is not taken by surprise or irreparably prejudiced (see <em>Lu Bang Song</em> at [17]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in <em>V Nithia (co-administratrix of the estate of Ponnusamy Sivapakiam, deceased) v Buthmanaban s/o Vaithilingam and another</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18240-SSP.xml')">[2015] 5 SLR 1422</a> (“<em>V Nithia</em>”), the Court of Appeal held that a court is not required to adopt an overly formalistic and inflexibly rule-bound approach even in those clear cases that to do so might lead to an unjust result. The law permits the departure from the general rule in limited circumstances, where no prejudice is caused to the other party in the trial or where it would be clearly unjust for the court not to do so (at [39]-[40]). While the court in <em>V Nithia</em> declined leave to pursue an unpleaded point, that was because the new cause of action was premised on “significantly different factual underpinnings”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, it seems to me that the Defendant had no good reason to deny the Claimant from pursuing clause 3.3.4. No doubt, there was an oversight on the Claimant’s part. It omitted to ground its claim on clause 3.3.4 earlier. But that omission should not be fatal, since its desire to compel the Defendant to <em>return</em> the incentive had been made abundantly clear since the outset of this action. It had also led evidence on why the Defendant was ineligible to retain the incentive, namely, that he tendered his resignation in the same month as when he received the incentive.</a></p><a id="p1_31"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the evidence and the substantive law, there also appeared to be no good reason why the Defendant should be allowed to pocket the incentive. Contractually, he was not entitled to retain that incentive. While he was deemed an “eligible” employee under clause 3.3.3 when the Claimant processed the payment, he lost the eligibility to receive and retain the incentive under clauses 3.3.3 and 3.3.4 after tendering his resignation notice. The Claimant’s oversight may of course have a bearing on the appropriate cost order, but in principle, it should not prevent the Claimant from recovering what is contractually due.</a></p><a id="p1_32"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For good order, however, I directed the Claimant to amend its Statement of Claim to plead clause 3.3.4 and granted the Defendant leave to make corresponding amendments to his Defence. I also granted both parties leave to lead evidence on this provision. In doing so, I bore in mind the following caution sounded in <em>V Nithia</em>:</a></p><a id="p1_33"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">61&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;… The court may express its wish that the parties reframe the issues so that the case may be better decided. However, if a court raises a new issue or a new cause of action on its own motion after hearing the evidence at trial, good order requires that the court invite the parties to amend their pleadings and for the party affected by this issue be allowed to re-examine the witnesses and/or to call rebuttal evidence on the hereinbefore unexplored point. However, the court must bear in mind that such a step may not be taken if it causes irreparable damage to the other party, <em>ie</em>, damage that cannot be compensated by an order for costs thrown away. …</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Claimant filed its amended Statement of Claim and the Defendant filed his amended Defence thereafter. The Claimant filed a supplemental Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief on the provision. The Defendant elected not to lead evidence. Parties also attended a second tranche trial to examine and cross-examine the witnesses.</a></p><a id="p1_34"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard the further evidence, I am of the view that the Claimant should be allowed to enforce clause 3.3.4 of the Employee Handbook. At the second tranche trial, the Defendant took issue with clause 3.3.4 being new provision that was introduced into a revised version of the Employee Handbook on 11 February 2022. The Defendant said he never acknowledged or agreed to this provision. While the Claimant agreed that this provision was indeed introduced after the signing of the Employment Letter, it relied on clause 9 of the Employment Letter which gave the Claimant the “exclusive right and sole discretion of the Claimant to change such benefits and terms at any time hereafter”. The Claimant further stressed that it had sent an email to employees, including the Defendant, to notify them of the revised Employee Handbook and the change in policy. Its HR Consultant, Ms Sylvia Zhuo (“Ms Zhuo”), explained on the stand that the policy is tied to the incentive being variable and discretionary in nature. While the Defendant took issue with the Claimant unilaterally changing the terms of the Employee Handbook, he did not identify any authorities or legal basis that would vitiate the Claimant’s right to do so under clause 9 of the Employment Letter, apart from a vague reference to the “Employment Act”.</a></p><a id="p1_35"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counsel for the Claimant also explained that the bonus was discretionary in nature. This is because the payment of bonuses is not contractually stipulated in the Employment Letter. It is therefore up to the Claimant to decide the terms on which such discretionary payments are to be made.</a></p><a id="p1_36"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Zhuo also testified that the difference between clauses 3.3.3 and 3.3.4 is that the former deals with who is eligible to receive the variable incentive, whereas the latter deals with what happens to the variable incentive after it has been paid. She explained that the Defendant was deemed eligible at the time the payment was processed. But later on, he was no longer eligible to receive or retain the payment.</a></p><a id="p1_37"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, while clause 3.3.3 did not expressly entitle the Claimant to claw back the variable incentive, clause 3.3.4 certainly did.</a></p><a id="p1_38"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant also resurrected the previously abandoned unjust enrichment claim in its written submissions. The problem for the Claimant however is that it neither asserted unjust enrichment nor identified an unjust factor in its pleadings. In its written submissions, the Claimant cited the case of <em>Red Star Marine Consultants Pte Ltd v Personal Representatives of the Estate of Satwant Kaur d/o Sardara Singh, deceased and another</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23242-SSP.xml')">[2019] SGHC 144</a>. Woo Bih Li J (as he then was) held that the plaintiff’s case in unjust enrichment was not adequately pleaded because it had simply asserted that the defendants were liable in unjust enrichment without identifying a particular recognised unjust factor or event which would give rise to a claim. He found that this failure was fatal to the plaintiff’s claims in unjust enrichment (at [50]-[52]). The Claimant argued that this case does not stand for the proposition that the ‘the name of the unjust factor, such as “total failure of basis” or “mistake” must be specifically pleaded’. Given my decision to allow the Claimant to enforce its rights under contract, it is not necessary for me to make a specific finding on its alternative case premised on unjust enrichment.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I allow the claim for the above reasons stated and will hear parties on costs.
