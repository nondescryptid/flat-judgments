It was proposed in the Letter to table a motion of no confidence against the 3<sup>rd</sup> Management Council and a motion to select a new Management Council. The plaintiffs’ case was that the Letter was defamatory and started the present suit against the defendant based on the tort of defamation.</a></p><a id="p1_2"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the trial, my decision was to dismiss the plaintiffs’ claim.

He then decided to take action to have his concerns addressed by publishing the Letter for which the key disputed words as underlined below (“Written Words”) were as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_4"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“The intent of this note is to:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduce the maintenance fees by $3.00 (three dollars) per share.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">2 Resume shuttle bus service for our residents without increase of maintenance fees.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Resolve (sic) current council members due to no confidence, incidents of event against the estate house-rules; pets pool party at badminton court during the water carnival on 20<sup>th</sup> May 2017 and pets party at badminton court on 4<sup>th</sup> August 2017 (“Written Words A”).</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Mismanaged (sic) of our estate (“Written Words B)</u>: e.g. Landscape and estate lightings were down and not replace, fountains cleanliness and pumps not functioning problem, guest toilets cleanliness problem, swimming pool cleanliness problem and landscaping deteriorated at rear side of the estate.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-elect of council members.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review through the whole set of estate house-rules by law.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please try to attend the EOGM to vote or vote through proxy if you cannot attend.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Notice of the EOGM will be delivered to you in due course.”</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiffs were unhappy with the defendant’s Letter as they took the position that the Letter was defamatory. The plaintiffs held important positions in multinational entities as well in local bodies.

The second plaintiff is the regional Chief Financial Officer of a multinational entity listed on the London Stock Exchange in the area of ground engineering and an adjunct lecturer at the Singapore University of Social Sciences. The third plaintiff is a regional Supply Chain Specialist of a multinational entity in the aviation industry.

Further, as the Letter was a requisition for a EOGM, notice was sent to all voting members of the Condominium. These notices for the EOGM repeated the Written Words and they were posted on notice boards in lift lobbies and on the official website of the Canopy during the period of 21 November 2017 to 23 December 2017.

In my view, the Written Words in their natural and ordinary meaning, when viewed with rest of the Letter as a whole, were understood to mean that the Management Council no longer commanded the confidence of the subsidiary proprietors because the Management Council members had organised, in particular, two events that breached the rules and regulations of the house rules as defined in “The Canopy Executive Condominium Resident’s Handbook” and that the Management Council and its members at the material time had managed the Condominium poorly. As a result, the defendant proposed an EOGM to re-elect the Management Council members.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that in this case, the written words in the allegedly defamatory statement were not defamatory as the legal test for establishing defamation had not been satisfied. Firstly, the plaintiffs had clearly not been specifically named in the statement as reference was made to the council as a group. During the EOGM, the defendant had clarified that he referred to “the whole team”. The first plaintiff also agreed during cross-examination in court that the written words referred to the whole council. I found that when an ordinary reasonable reader did read the written words, it did not lower the standing of the plaintiffs in the estimation of right thinking members of society as the defendant was merely raising his concerns about the way the estate had been run and the necessary action was for the council to be dissolved and re-elected. There was no reference made in the Letter as to incompetence or negligence or had breached any statutory duties or had abused their positions as council members.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I agreed with [111] to [116] of the defendant’s Closing Submissions in that the “sting” of an otherwise defamatory statement could be neutralised if the context in which it was published called for circumspection. In <em>Terrence Fernandez v Lim Shao Ying Genevieve</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25491-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGHC 278</a>, the Court found that where the nature of an allegedly defamatory document was a complaint and where it was going to be part of a disciplinary process, the sting of any insult was neutralised by the context of the publication because a complaint necessarily entailed levving allegations which in turn would necessarily attract a certain degree of fair-minded scepticism from the original reasonable reader.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present suit, the Written Words were a series of complaints to be put before a EOGM for the subsidiary proprietors of the Canopy to consider re-election of the Management Council members. This was supported by the plaintiff’s witness, Mr Brian Lim, who testified in court that Resolution 4 pertaining to the alleged mismanagement of the Canopy “look more like a complaint.” Hence, Resolutions 3 and 4 were ruled “out of motion”. As rightly put forth by the defendant, reasonably-informed subsidiary proprietors would reserve judgment until EOGM when the complaints would be discussed and voted on. Hence, I found that the Written Words and the same words when uttered orally could not have been defamatory as the sting had been neutralised by circumspection as these complaints were to be discussed at the EOGM.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 2- If the Letter was defamatory, did the pleaded defences of justification and qualified privilege apply?</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having found that the written words were not defamatory, there was no necessity for me to go further on the applicable defences. For completeness, I shall do so on the first pleaded defence of justification. Even taking the plaintiffs’ case at its highest in that the written words were defamatory, I found that the defence of justification applied here as the defendant had proven it to be true that the subsidiary proprietors had lost confidence in the 3<sup>rd</sup> council and that the condominium’s various facilities were mismanaged.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To establish this defence, the defendant would need to prove the substance or gist of the offending words was true as laid down at [134] of <em>Review Publishing Co Ltd v Lee Hsien Loong</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 1 SLR 0052.xml')">[2010] 1 SLR 52</a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agreed with the defendant that the subsidiary proprietors had lost confidence in the council in that majority of the subsidiary proprietors had voted to dissolve the 3<sup>rd</sup> council rather than allowing it to continue in office at the EOGM held on 23 December 2017 at 10am<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a>.

Hence, there was justification for the written words relating to dissolution of the 3<sup>rd</sup> council.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that for the 2 events of the water carnival held on 20<sup>th</sup> May 2017 and pets party on 4 August 2017 which took place at the badminton court were not in compliance with the rules and regulations of “The Canopy executive Condominium Resident’s Handbook.” It was clear that the rules and regulations, in particular, [17] of section 5.3 of the Residents’ Handbook provided for no pets to be allowed at the badminton court. Even if such a rule could be changed, it was only if due notice was given to do so. The first plaintiff conceded that no such notice was given.</a></p><a id="p1_25"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agreed with the defendant that he did not approve having pets at the badminton court for the Halloween party on 5 November 2016. His approval was given only for pets walking around the estate and not at the badminton court. I also agreed with the defendant that he did not give approval for pets being present for the water carnival of 20 May 2017 as no pets was mentioned in the Whatsapp chat<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a> that evidenced approval for this event.

Hence, there was justification for the written words pertaining to poor maintenance of the estate. Although it might be the MA’s direct responsibility to ensure the estate was well maintained, it was the Management Council that had oversight of the MA. It was for this reason that the MA referred to decisions and issues to council members for consideration and decision. I found that there was evidence of poor maintenance of these facilities. I shall elaborate on my findings relating to the poor maintenance of the facilities in the Condominium.</a></p><a id="p1_27"> <p class="Judg-Heading-4"> <u>Landscape and estate lighting</u> </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second plaintiff conceded during cross-examination that it was possible for 15-20 estate lamps not to be working for 2 or more months. It was also the evidence of plaintiff’s witness Mr Brian Lim that it was very common for lights and pumps in the estate not to be fixed for 4 weeks and that it was fair for the subsidiary proprietors to feel discontent when this happened.</a></p><a id="p1_28"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendant also exhibited in his AEIC<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a> some photographs showing lights in the development that were not working.

I accepted the defendant’s evidence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4"> <u>Pumps in fountains</u> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second plaintiff’s AEIC, he stated that the pumps were faulty, and water were “stagnant” and “milky”. The second plaintiff stated in [77] and [78] of his s AEIC<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a> that for the period of 11 July 2017 to 2 September 2017, the fountains were “not totally clear”. In my view, this was an acknowledgement that the pumps in the fountains were not working properly.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4"> <u>Guest toilets</u> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During cross-examination, the defendant conceded that there was no evidence in the form of photographs taken by him evidencing dirty toilets prior to the renovation that was completed after December 2017 before Chinese New Year. His photos in his AEIC<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a> were instead taken after the renovation. However, I found that at [83] of the second plaintiff’s AEIC<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>, he stated that there was bad air circulation due to “design flaw”. As result, mould and fungus could grow quite quickly. In my mind, this was a concession that the condition of the toilets was less than desirable.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4"> <u>Swimming pool</u> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second plaintiff conceded in [89] of his AEIC<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a> that it was possible for algae to grow in the swimming pool and at [92], he also conceded that 2 underwater lamps would slightly be out of position in that they popped out. The defendant also exhibited in his AEIC<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> photographs showing algae in the swimming pool. This proved that the swimming pool was not properly maintained.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4"> <u>Landscape at rear of condominium</u> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first plaintiff agreed during cross-examination in court that landscaping at those areas was bare at times. The second plaintiff also agreed that the plants at the rear of the estate were not growing. The defendant also exhibited in his AEIC<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a> photographs showing the plants not growing properly at the rear of the estate. Hence, I was of the view that the landscape at the rear of the Condominium was poorly maintained.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having found that the first pleaded defence of justification applied to the present suit, there was no necessity for me to determine if the second defence of qualified privilege applied in that the defamatory statements were made on occasion of qualified privilege and if the defence of qualified privilege had been defeated by malice.</a></p><a id="p1_34"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the above reasons, I dismissed the plaintiffs’ claim. After hearing parties on their submissions relating to costs and disbursements, I fixed the costs and disbursements accordingly to be paid by the plaintiffs to the defendant.</a></p><a id="p1_35"> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"></a><p class="Footnote"><a id="p1_35"><sup></sup></a><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a>5 BA pg 170</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>Defendant’s closing submissions at [101] pg 43-44</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>1 BA pg 109-112</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>BA Vol 5 at pg 226-228</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_5_1" id="Ftn_5">[note: 5]</a></sup>2 BA pg 21</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_6_1" id="Ftn_6">[note: 6]</a></sup>BA Vol 5 pg 215</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_7_1" id="Ftn_7">[note: 7]</a></sup>2 BA pg 23</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_8_1" id="Ftn_8">[note: 8]</a></sup>2 BA pg 24</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_9_1" id="Ftn_9">[note: 9]</a></sup>BA Vol 5 pg 230</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_10_1" id="Ftn_10">[note: 10]</a></sup>BA Vol 5 pg 225</p></div></content></html>
