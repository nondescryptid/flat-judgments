interpretation and application of section 355(2) of the CPC is the case of <em>Parti Liyani v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26153-SSP.xml')">[2021] SGHC 146</a> (“<em>Parti Liyani</em>”). In <em>Parti Liyani</em>, the High Court set out the law or legal principles as regards the interpretation and application of section 359(3) CPC which contains the same criteria for the court to order the prosecution or complainant to pay compensation to the accused in a sum not exceeding $10,000 as that for the award of costs against the prosecution or complainant as set out in section 355(2).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of whether the prosecution was frivolous or vexatious, the question to ask is whether, based on the evidence the complainant had at the time of commencement of prosecution or continuation of prosecution, an objective reasonable prosecutor would have considered that there was sufficient evidence to render the case fit to be tried or continued before the court.</a></p><a id="p1_11"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the analysis as to the sufficiency of evidence is predominantly objective, the overall inquiry as to whether the prosecution was “frivolous or vexatious” has both objective and subjective elements ([124]). The word “vexatious” suggests a more subjective analysis into the state of mind of the complainant ([125]). While there is no requirement to prove malice or dishonesty to show “frivolous or vexatious” prosecution, this does not mean they are irrelevant because the existence of malice, dishonesty or improper motives may well render the prosecution vexatious ([126]).</a></p><a id="p1_12"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In essence, the court has to consider the totality of the circumstances to arrive at a view as to whether the prosecution was “frivolous or vexatious”. ([126])</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the burden of proving to the “satisfaction of the court” that the prosecution was “frivolous or vexatious”, it lies on the applicant who is seeking the costs order and the appropriate standard of proof is on a balance of probabilities ([129]). However, as the assertion that the prosecution was “frivolous or vexatious” is a serious and grave one, Chan Seng Onn J in <em>Parti Liyani</em> is of the view that the gravity of the allegations must be part of the whole range of circumstances that have to be weighed by the court when deciding as to the balance of probabilities ([131]).</a></p><a id="p1_14"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues to be determined</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the above, the sole issue to be determined is: Whether the prosecution was “frivolous or vexatious”.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the prosecution was frivolous or vexatious in the present case</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starting point for this case is that it is to be distinguished from <em>Parti Liyani</em> in that the prosecution here is by a private party against another. Unlike the <em>Parti Liyani</em> case where the High Court starts off on the premise that the Public Prosecutor, playing its constitutional role, is presumed to be acting in the public interest when it commences or continues any prosecution ([118]), in this case, there is no such premise. In my view, this main differentiating factor is an important one when assessing the totality of the circumstances in arriving at the conclusion as to whether the prosecution brought by Huang against Juan was frivolous or vexatious.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the totality of all of the circumstances in this case, I conclude that the prosecution by Huang against Juan was both frivolous and vexatious.</a></p><a id="p1_17"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The prosecution was frivolous in that there was no case fit to be tried before the court in relation to 3 out of the 5 Charges - the Criminal Intimidation Charge, the Mischief Charge, and the 2<sup>nd</sup> POHA Charge.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated by Chan Seng Onn J, the touchstone of the inquiry as to whether “the prosecution was frivolous or vexatious” is the <em>evidential sufficiency of the commencement and continuation of the prosecution</em> ([116]). Where the evidence is so insufficient that there was no case fit to be tried before the court and the decision to commence and/or continue prosecution is objectively factually unsustainable, the prosecution will be considered as frivolous.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to the Criminal Intimidation Charge, Huang’s only evidence in support of this Charge is her own bare allegation that Juan had uttered the words, “I warn you, do not speak to my staff and do not pass by my shop, or each time I see you I will hit you” to her. While Huang had relied on her husband, Wang Xin (“Wang”) as her witness for this charge, it transpired at trial that Wang was not present when Juan allegedly uttered those words<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that at the trial proceedings I have found Huang’s testimony to be so full of inherent inconsistencies as to be lacking in any credibility altogether<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a>, I find that Huang’s commencement of the Criminal Intimidation Charge against Juan based solely on her own bare allegation that lacks credibility, is groundless and therefore, frivolous.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to the Mischief Charge, as I have noted in my judgment in the criminal prosecution proceedings, Huang did not adduce any credible, objective evidence of damage to the phone, such as the damaged phone itself, repair bills of the phone, or photographs showing the damaged phone and the like<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a>. Instead, the only evidence of damage tendered by Huang is a receipt that shows that she had purchased a new phone which I have found to be hardly evidence that shows that Huang’s phone was damaged by Juan given that there could be a variety of reasons for Huang to buy a new phone, as I have stated in my oral judgment<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. On this point, at trial, the defence was successful in bringing evidence from an independent witness that proves the contrary, that the allegedly “damaged” phone in fact appeared to be functioning well<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As damage or devaluation of property is a key or critical element to prove for a charge in mischief to be made out, such a failure of evidence goes to the root of the Charge. In the premises, I find that an objective, reasonable prosecutor in Huang’s shoes would have considered that the prosecution of the Mischief Charge is legally and factually unsustainable and would not have commenced or continued the prosecution thereof. As such, I have little difficulty in concluding that the commencement and/or continuation of the prosecution on the Mischief Charge by Huang is also frivolous.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to the 2<sup>nd</sup> POHA Charge, Huang had called Cai Zengyan, the person who was present with her during the incident on 25 October 2019 as her only independent witness to testify about the “act of harassment” (to wit, by spitting into the food of Huang) that was allegedly committed by Juan at the Kra Pow Thai restaurant.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At trial, this witness’s testimony turned out to be totally against Huang’s case and right from the get-go, it was apparent that this witness was an adverse witness. As such, during the trial proceedings, Huang had to proceed with her questioning of this witness by way of cross-examination as if she was the opponent’s witness. Throughout the trial proceedings, Huang’s questioning of this witness was opposing and acrimonious.

There is authority that acknowledges that a vexatious charge may include a charge that is true but made with the primary objective of harassing the person accused (see above at [69]). This suggests that from an objective perspective, even if the court is satisfied that there was <b><em>sufficient evidence making the case fit to be tried</em></b>, it may still be possible that the prosecution was “frivolous or vexatious” if the <b><em>prosecutor subjectively would not have brought the prosecution but for malice, dishonesty or an improper motive</em></b>. Hypothetically, if the particular DPP having conduct of the trial subjectively believed that the charge was groundless, even though in the court’s view there may be some evidence fit to be tried, but only proceeded against the accused person because of a personal vendetta, this may possibly be considered vexatious. (Emphasis in judgment).</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the prosecution by Huang against Juan on the 1<sup>st</sup> POHA Charge is one such case – Juan does not dispute she said the insulting words in the Charge. Therefore, there was sufficient evidence making the case fit to be tried in court. However, the editing of the video recordings by Huang shows her subjective intention of bringing these prosecution proceedings because of a personal vendetta against Juan or out of an intention to harass Juan. Because of this, the prosecution against Juan on the 1<sup>st</sup> POHA Charge is still rendered frivolous and/or vexatious, notwithstanding Juan’s admission to the utterance of the said insulting words in the Charge.</a></p><a id="p1_33"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on all of the foregoing, I have now found Huang’s prosecution against Juan on four of the five Charges to be frivolous or vexatious.</a></p><a id="p1_34"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Huang’s conduct of the criminal proceedings shows that her commencement of prosecution against Juan was motivated by improper motives.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the conduct of the prosecution at trial is not the subject of what is “frivolous or vexatious, the conduct of the prosecution may well reveal that the commencement and/or continuation of the prosecution to have been motivated by improper motives or some collateral purpose and renders the prosecution “frivolous or vexatious”” ([139]).</a></p><a id="p1_35"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, I turn now to the revelation of Huang’s true intentions behind the commencement and/or continuation of prosecution proceedings against Juan through the testimony of witnesses and the manner in which Huang had conducted the trial proceedings.</a></p><a id="p1_36"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Huang’s her own witness, Cai Zengyan has testified about how she was hounded or pestered by Huang to sue Juan over the injury caused by Juan on her (Cai Zengyan’s) hand during the incident on 25 October 2019 and how Huang wanted money from her to sue Juan over that injury to the point of Cai Zengyan giving Huang a “draft statement” for Huang’s use against Juan in order to get Huang off her back.</a></p><a id="p1_37"> </a><p class="Judg-Quote-1"><a id="p1_37">A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;…Subsequently, she came to my shop everyday and---and she asked me to lend her $20,000 so that she can sue Juan Lingjiao and she also tried to persuade me to give another $20,000 and then she wants me to sue Juan Lingjiao for injuring my hand. And she wants me to get Juan Lingjiao to compensate me S$100,000. At that time, I already told her this is illogical. And at that time, when the incident happened, where the lady sitting across me in the dock hurt my hand, I---I actually understand why. So subsequently she came to my shop every day. Every day, day after day, to the extent that it’s affecting my work and my life and she asked me to write a letter. So I typed a letter using my computer and there is nothing substantive inside the letter. It’s---it’s just that---that Mdm.

Cai Zengyan’s testimony shows that Huang had resorted to all means to go after Juan, including pestering Cai Zengyan to go after Juan, and this was way before she commenced prosecution proceedings against Juan. This is very telling of Huang’s personal vendetta against Juan. I have no reason not to believe Cai Zengyan’s testimony for she was in fact a prosecution witness called by Huang in support of her prosecution against Juan.</a></p><a id="p1_38"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, in her conduct of the criminal proceedings, Huang herself had revealed her real motive in commencing prosecution proceedings against Juan.</a></p><a id="p1_39"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a><a id="p1_40">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huang had attempted to call a witness by the name of “Shi Jian Hua” to testify as to whether Juan owns the shop she is operating from, a matter that is totally irrelevant to Huang’s Criminal Intimidation Charge against Juan. While I did not allow her to call this witness, her explanation in court as to why she wished to summon this witness is telling of her personal vendetta against Juan.

In fact, section 355(2) CPC is as much applicable to prosecutions commenced by the Public Prosecutor as it is to prosecutions commenced by private parties. As for the fact that she had conducted her own private prosecution only because the police had decided not to prosecute Juan, I cannot see how this factor does not in fact go against Huang. Be that as it may, it is still Huang’s own decision to commence and/or continue her prosecution against Juan and it is that decision that is being assessed as to whether it is frivolous or vexatious. As for her engaging a lawyer in the initial part of the process, it is irrelevant as this fact does not go towards the sufficiency of her evidence to commence her prosecution against Juan and does not tell me anything about her motive in commencing her prosecution against Juan. As for Huang’s contention that the court’s acquittal of Juan was due to the fact that her prosecution was without the assistance of the police and a particular “report” of the police, it is but a disingenuous excuse. In any event, from an early part of the criminal proceedings, Huang was made aware that the prosecution bore the burden of proof<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a>.
