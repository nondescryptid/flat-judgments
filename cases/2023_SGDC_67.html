He also admitted and consented to another slew of offences being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. After considering the facts, his plea in mitigation, his many antecedents – which included two prior terms of Corrective Training – and the submissions of the parties for the current offences, I sentenced him to a term of Preventive Detention. He has since filed an appeal against that sentence. These are the grounds for my decision on his sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_1"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">CHARGES, FACTS &amp; CHRONOLOGY:</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ng faced a total of 12 criminal charges. He pleaded guilty to 6 of them and admitted to the balance 6 and consented to them being taken into consideration by the court for the purpose of sentencing. For the 6 proceeded charges, Mr Ng admitted without qualification to the entirety of the Statement of Facts which ran into 7 pages. A chronological summary of the charges, facts, and parts of the case history are set out below.</a></p><a id="p1_2"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ng was released from Prisons on remission for an earlier set of offences on <b>10 July 2018.</b></a></p><a id="p1_3"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after his release, he actively sought out and managed to contact one Mdm Shi Ka Yee who had been in the news for her disgraceful criminal conduct at her house and in her Ferrari. Mr Ng had read in the newspapers about Mdm Shi’s court case whilst he was still serving sentence in prison. Knowing that Mdm Shi was about to begin serving an imprisonment term for her offences, Mr Ng sought her out and propositioned her that he was able to help her because he knew several senior Prisons officers. Pursuant to his corrupt solicitations, Mdm Shi handed over a sum of $2,000/- to him on <b>19 October 2018</b> as gratification for Prisons officers looking out for her so as to make her life in prisons easier (DAC 927840/2019). The matter came to the notice of the CPIB soon after, and in mid-November 2018, Mr Ng was called up by CPIB for investigations – he was however allowed to remain on bail whilst investigations completed.</a></p><a id="p1_4"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few weeks later, Mr Ng was arrested at a roadblock on the <b>30 December 2018</b> and was found to be repeating some of the very same driving offences for which he had previously been sent to prison for, i.e. driving whilst under disqualification and without insurance (DAC 903238/2019 and 903239/2019 respectively). He was formally charged in court on 30 January 2019 for those actions and was released after furnishing court bail. He indicated to the court – through his instructed counsel – that he needed time to make representations on those charges.</a></p><a id="p1_5"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst on that said bail, Mr Ng was arrested a few months later at another roadblock on <b>25 June 2019</b> repeating those same driving related offences again; this time with another car that he took and drove without the owner’s consent (DAC 919466/2019). For these repeated actions, fresh court charges were brought against him on 10 July 2019. His counsel discharged themselves, and the case was adjourned for investigations to be completed. He was again released on bail after furnishing the doubled court bail sum.</a></p><a id="p1_6"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During that time whilst on bail, Mr Ng managed to secure for himself a position in a cleaning company. One of the premises he was assigned to work at was the Textile Centre at Jalan Sultan. Residents there then started lodging reports of missing valuables, and investigations by the authorities pointed to Mr Ng’s involvement. Mr Ng eventually admitted to one count of house-trespass to steal $650/- in cash committed on <b>15 December 2019</b> (DAC 908519/2020), which act was caught on CCTV. After a raid at his home on <b>3 January 2020</b> found him in possession of various property, he also eventually admitted to one further count of being in fraudulent possession of a handbag and various jewelry items (MAC 903641/2020). Formal charges for these actions were tendered in court against him in January 2020, and he remained in remand after court bail was increased further on account of those new charges. By that stage, Mr Ng was represented by a second set of instructed Counsel. Subsequently, a third and fourth set of Counsel came on-board, and by the time plea was entered before me, Mr Ng was acting in person. More will be said about that case history later. Returning to the charges at hand, it was agreed that Mr Ng finally made restitution of the $650 to the victim only around January 2022.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Charges Taken Into Consideration:</em> </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before me, Mr Ng also admitted to 4 other similar house-trespass charges involving the theft of a range of valuables (i.e. wallets, handbags, cash, electronics, cigarettes, watches, jewelry and ID &amp; banking documents, with a total value in excess of $78,544.08) committed at different residential units at the Textile Centre over the period from <b>November till December 2019</b>, and consented to them being taken into consideration by the court for the purposes of sentencing (DAC 908520/2020, 908521/2020, 908522/2020, &amp; 900183/2020); this together with the set of other two driving related offences from his arrest episode in June 2019 (DAC 919464/2019 &amp; 919465/2019).</a></p><a id="p1_8"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prescribed Penalties:</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 6 proceeded charges carried substantial penalties:</a></p><a id="p1_9"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_9-p2_a">a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>DAC 927840/2019:</b> for corruptly soliciting gratification, being an offence under s 5(a)(ii) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Cap. 241 (“PCA”): <em>Fine not exceeding $100,000, or Imprisonment not exceeding 5 years, or to Both.</em> Additionally, for doing so in breach of his remission order: an enhanced sentence of up to <em>313 days</em>.</a></p><a id="p1_9-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_9-p2_b">b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>DAC 903238/2019:</b> for driving whilst under disqualification, having been convicted of the same offence twice previously in 2014 and 2016, being an offence under s 43(4) of the Road Traffic Act, Cap. 276 (“RTA”), and punishable under s 67A(1) of the RTA: <em>Fine not exceeding $30,000/-, or to Imprisonment not exceeding 9 years, or to Both.</em> Additionally, for doing so in breach of his remission order: an enhanced sentence of up to <em>241 days</em>.</a></p><a id="p1_9-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_9-p2_c">c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>DAC 903239/2019:</b> for driving without valid insurance in place, being an offence under s 3(1) and punishable under ss 3(2) and 3(3) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks &amp; Compensation) Act, Cap. 189: <em>Fine not exceeding $1,000/-, or Imprisonment not exceeding 3 months, or to Both.</em> Additionally, for doing so in breach of his remission order: an enhanced sentence of up to <em>241 days</em>.</a></p><a id="p1_9-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_9-p2_d">d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>DAC 919466/2019:</b> for taking and driving away the motorcar without the owner’s consent, being an offence under s 96(1) of the RTA: <em>Fine not exceeding $1,000/-, or Imprisonment not exceeding 3 months.</em> Additionally, for doing so in breach of his remission order: an enhanced sentence of up to <em>64 days</em>.</a></p><a id="p1_9-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_9-p2_e">e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>DAC 908519/2020:</b> for House-Trespass to commit Theft, being an offence under s 451 of the Penal Code, Cap. 224: <em>Imprisonment of up to 7 years.</em></a></p><a id="p1_9-p2_e"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_e"></a><a id="p1_9-p2_f">f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>MAC 903641/2020:</b> for Fraudulent Possession of Property, being an offence under s 35(1) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order &amp; Nuisance) Act, Cap. 184: <em>Fine not exceeding $3,000/-, or Imprisonment not exceeding 1 year, or to Both.</em></a></p><a id="p1_9-p2_f"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">ANTECEDENTS:</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9-p2_f"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ng’s CRO records ran into 40 pages.

He indicated that soon after being released on bail, he had returned to gainful employment as an operations supervisor who was looking after a group of cleaners at a cleaning company. He emphasized that there were instances when he had come across unattended valuables while at work, but that he had resisted the temptation to touch them. He indicated that his current wife had filed for divorce, and that he had a daughter (from his earlier marriage) who was aged about 10 years old. When asked if he was supporting his daughter’s upkeep, Mr Ng rambled and offered no clear answer. He indicated that he wanted to mend his current marriage (entered in 2018) and had gotten his sister to help him pay a sum on his behalf to his wife. He indicated that he lost his sense of smell and taste, and that it caused him many struggles.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> He explained that he kept returning to driving as that activity provided him with relief from the anxieties he had. He said it was a psychological condition – one which was sparked after his father taught him how to drive when he was young. He said he was a burden to his mother when he kept offending, and that was why she committed suicide when he was 13 years old. He said he was grateful to his sister for gathering the property together to bail him out from the current court case, and that he wanted to prove that he was worthy of her trust by changing for the better because he was older and less impulsive now. He said he did not deal with drugs, and was not violent, and hoped not to be sentenced to Preventive Detention <em>“for such a small case”</em>, otherwise he would rather <em>‘commit a very big case before coming in as that would be better’</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> He said the progress he made can be seen in the fact that he had stopped stealing cars and had instead bought his own to drive using monies he had earned. Finally, he said he hoped to have the chance to do right by his wife, who had twice tried to commit suicide after all the things they had gone through.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">SUBMISSIONS:</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The learned DPP filed full written submissions. In gist, given the seriousness of the present set of charges, the manner in which they were committed, the likely aggregate sentence for them, plus the fact that they were repeated instances of an already poor record which Mr Ng presented with, the Prosecution submitted that the court ought to call for a pre-sentence report to ascertain his suitability for either Corrective Training or Preventive Detention. The Prosecution highlighted that Mr Ng planned his return to reoffending whilst still in prison, and that he kept on clocking up more offences even whilst he was on bail for investigations to be completed for his earlier offences.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found those submissions by the Prosecution to be fair, objective, and accurate, and I called for a pre-sentence report under s 304(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (“CPC”).</a></p><a id="p1_14"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">PRE-SENTENCE REPORT:</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1 November 2022, the Commissioner of Prisons (“the Commissioner”) submitted the report stating that Mr Ng had been examined and found to be in generally good physical condition &amp; of normal mental condition and was suitable for either regime (CT/PD). Part of the conclusion stated that there were no protective factors noted, and that Mr Ng <em>“presented with a High Risk/Need level of criminal re-offending”</em> and that he <em>“minimized the severity of his current offences and his responsibility in them”.</em></a></p><a id="p1_15"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">FURTHER SUBMISSIONS:</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the proceedings resumed after the Commissioner’s report was submitted, learned counsel Mr Wee Hong Shern appeared in court and indicated that he had been instructed by an associate of Mr Ng to act for him. Counsel sought time to confer with Mr Ng and this was granted. The proceedings were further adjourned after Mr Ng confirmed that he wished to have Mr Wee as his counsel to tender submissions on sentencing. Those submissions were finally received by this court on 7 February 2023. In gist, learned counsel submitted that any term of Preventive Detention would have been crushing, and that a <em>‘condign aggregate sentence in this case would be in the region of about 6 years imprisonment instead’.</em> I found that suggested aggregate term to be a commendably realistic assessment for the proceeded charges <em>if</em> normal sentencing was indeed called for in this case. I will return to deal with counsel’s specific arguments later and explain why I determined that normal sentencing was not called for here.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response, the learned DPP submitted that the present case clearly justified the more robust sentencing options in s 304 of the CPC; the prosecution left the calibration of the total length to the discretion of the court.</a></p><a id="p1_17"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">REASONS FOR DECISION ON SENTENCE:</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I start by addressing the facts of the current offences and how the antecedents affected the sentencing approach. In my judgment, Mr Ng’s poor record, of 105 and counting, shows that he is a habitual offender. His antecedents show that the only period in his life when he stopped offending was when he was prevented from doing so by virtue of being in lawful custody. Every time he was released, he went back to offending soon after with tragic consequences for not just his many victims, but also for his own family members. Additionally, the offending was aggravated because they always involved multiple instances of either repeat offences or progressively more serious types of offending which ran the gamut: from his driving related offences to property &amp; vehicular theft, to cheating, to outrages of decency, to violence against a public servant, to house-trespass, to getting involved with illegal syndicates and illegal moneylenders to harass their debtors. This continued to be the situation with the present set of charges – the first of which was planned for by him even whilst still serving sentence in prison, and the rest were continuously committed by him even whilst placed on progressively more stringent bail. Mr Ng’s antecedents &amp; his current offences indicated the following: that whilst having come from evidently challenging personal family circumstances when he was younger, Mr Ng had been accorded multiple, and progressively more substantive opportunities at each age for rehabilitation &amp; reform. Each of those instances – including all the subsequent terms of custodial sentences – would have afforded him a clear awareness of right and wrong, and their consequences. Despite those repeated opportunities, little meaningful effort has been exhibited by him to imbibe the values of virtue and to live by them. In fact, given the perverse regularity of his re-offending, he has shown the exact opposite at each instance with his prompt return to reoffending after every release. At every episode, he was dealt with for multiple offences, and not a single episode involved a one-off case of offending – which may perhaps be indicative of a momentary lapse, and thus some effort at reform on his part. His record and the facts for the current offences all indicated a continuing troubling proclivity towards crime which was deeply ingrained even as he went through two marriages and fathered along the way – a proclivity which remained entirely undeterred and undiminished despite two terms of Corrective Training, and despite progressively stiffer penalties. The Commissioner’s conclusion on Mr Ng was entirely consistent with that assessment and it bears repeating: that there were no protective factors noted, and that Mr Ng <em>“presented with a High Risk/Need level of criminal re-offending”</em> and that he <em>“minimized the severity of his current offences and his responsibility in them”.</em> Even before me, Mr Ng continued to make light of his offences and offer up statements justifying his driving related offending as being part of his ‘addiction/nature’ and indicated that he had no plans to stop that conduct. It was plain to see that Mr Ng has not arrived anywhere near the point where he was prepared to stop taking short cuts, to stop taking liberties with the law and with others, and to start making an earnest effort at a good life. There was every reason to believe that Mr Ng was unreformed and will return to offending once he is given the opportunity. In accordance with the principles laid down by the superior courts on when Preventive Detention is appropriate: <em>PP v Syed Hamid Bin A Kadir Alhamid</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/7632-M.xml')">[2002] SGCA 40</a> at [10], <em>PP v Rosli bin Yassin</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGCA 0021.xml')">[2013] SGCA 21</a> at [11], and in <em>Sim Yeow Kee v PP and another appeal</em> [2016]4 SLR 936 at [97], I determined that Mr Ng’s demonstrated propensity towards crime was so evidently high that this was a situation where he ought to be taken out of circulation altogether because he continues to pose a serious menace to all those around him whenever he is released.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to address some of the specific arguments raised by Mr Ng in his mitigation:</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_19-p2_">■&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ng argued that his offences (both his current ones and his antecedents) were <em>‘minor and not serious’</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a> I did not agree, and neither did my brother and sister judges who dealt with him previously. At no stage did any of the sentences meted out to him for his offences give room for anyone to conclude that the offences being dealt with were minor and not serious. It was clear that Mr Ng’s statement was indicative instead of his continuing (and troubling) mindset of justifying his criminal behaviour and minimizing the severity of his offending and his responsibility for them.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2__1">■&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ng argued that his offences did not deserve Preventive Detention and that it should be reserved for <em>‘very big cases’</em> instead.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a> The implicit point being made is that Preventive Detention ought to be reserved only for habitual offenders who posed serious threats of violence, sex and drugs to society – the kind of offences which Mr Ng claimed he did not have (save for when he assaulted the public servant<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> and got into frequent fights with others in prison<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>). I did not agree because this argument misapplies the law where there is actually no such categorical restriction on the applicability of Preventive Detention: see especially the pronouncement of the Court of Appeal in <em>PP v Syed Hamid bin A Kadir Alhamid</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/7632-M.xml')">[2002] SGCA 40</a> at [10].</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2__2">■&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some might say that Mr Ng is himself a tragic victim being a “product of the system” where the previous rehabilitative and penal approaches have obviously failed since they have resulted in the present outcomes. This argument is most unpersuasive: it conveniently ignores the agency which each one of us, including Mr Ng, has over our choices, and it cynically discounts the entirety of the earnest work undertaken by the serious men and women in rehabilitation at our various penal institutions. There is simply no basis to perversely reward with leniency the progressively worse behaviour on display by Mr Ng.</a></p><a id="p1_19-p2__2"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19-p2__2"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to address the specific submissions made by learned counsel on Mr Ng’s behalf:</a></p><a id="p1_20"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_20-p2_">■&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Mr Ng labours under mental disorders which have a causal link to his offences. The Defence referred to the report dated 17 August 2019 by Dr Tommy Tan (at Novena Psychiatry Clinic) who found that Mr Ng suffered from ‘Impulse Disorder which was causally connected to his driving related offences’. The Defence submitted that this aspect of Mr Ng was not appreciated previously by the courts, and that it resulted in unduly harsh sentences being meted out to him, and that this court ought to reassess those antecedents in the current diagnosis, appreciate that he was unduly harshly dealt with previously, and extend compassion and leniency to him now.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a> I first noted that this submission unjustifiably extrapolates Dr Tan’s conclusion as basis to call into question the sentencing for <em>all</em> of Mr Ng’s varied antecedents when Dr Tan’s conclusion was actually restricted only to Mr Ng’s driving related offences. In fact, Dr Tan states this himself in his report<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>, and the case history shows that the report was specifically obtained by Mr Ng’s earlier counsel as part of representations for driving related offences only – see [6] above. The fact of the matter is that Mr Ng was not only facing driving related offences previously, and neither was he facing those offences in isolation before me. As recounted earlier, Mr Ng was in fact dealt with previously for a host of serious offences and that is again the case here. Insofar as the submission was restricted to Mr Ng’s driving related offences only, I next noted that the submission was premised entirely on the coherence of Dr Tommy Tan’s conclusion being accepted. I could not accept the submission because Mr Ng was examined subsequently at IMH and that said conclusion by Dr Tan was reviewed and rejected in the final analysis: see the report dated 8 February 2022 by Dr Christopher Cheok (at IMH). There was no basis for this court to question Dr Cheok’s detailed and coherent reasons in doing so.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> I agreed with Dr Cheok who found Mr Ng to have Organic Brain Syndrome (which arose from injuries he suffered after being assaulted by his then brother-in-law in 2013, and which led to him losing his sense of smell and taste), and an Antisocial Personality Disorder, but that neither had any effect on his culpability (soundness of mind) previously or on this occasion for any of his offences. In fact, Dr Cheok found the <em>“risk of reoffending to be high”</em> and that “<em>there wasn’t any pharmacological or psychotherapeutic intervention that could significantly modify his offending behaviour unless the accused himself commits himself to change and decides to act within the law”.</em><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> In my judgment, those assessments were consistent with my own and they strengthened the case for the imposition of a term of Preventive Detention.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2__3">■&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Defence submitted that Mr Ng is remorseful and has made remarkable efforts at reform since 2020, and consequently, that further escalation to a Preventive Detention was not justified.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a> This submission made reference to select parts of the Commissioner’s report where it recounted the efforts made by Mr Ng to conduct himself well whilst in remand (in contrast to his previous behaviour where he clocked up 22 institutional charges across his incarcerations), and to his efforts in getting fellow inmates to renounce their Secret Society affiliations, and which had apparently come at great personal cost to him because other SS members had met him with reprisals for those actions. I agreed that those developments were relevant to the sentencing calculus, and that they ought to be considered in determining the <em>period</em> of incarceration ordered, but they did not affect the type of incarceration which ought to be ordered. Those developments indicated that Mr Ng was capable responding positively in the right environment and was capable of better when he put his mind to it. Those developments were however only a small part of all the factors which the Commissioner set out and considered in his report. When the report is read in its proper context, the Commissioner considered those factors, plus all the rest of Mr Ng’s past criminal history, his family &amp; marital history, his educational &amp; employment history, his chosen companions whom he spent time with, his leisure &amp; recreational choices, his alcohol/drug use history, his antisocial behaviour, and his attitude/orientation towards his offences before reaching the conclusion recounted earlier, i.e. that there were no protective factors noted, and that Mr Ng presented with a High Risk/Need level of criminal re-offending once out of the prisons environment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given all the matters set out before me, I concluded that this court would be remiss if it failed to adequately consider the seriousness of the conduct on display and of the offences themselves in the current charges, the consequent need for specific deterrence in this case, and the need for the public to be protected from being further victimised by Mr Ng’s conduct. I did not consider it appropriate to order a third term of Corrective Training since it was already apparent that the first two had no effect on him. It was beyond dispute that all the technical requirements for the consideration of a term of Preventive Detention were met in this case. I considered the proportionality aspect in the round for the proceeded charges and concluded that a term of Preventive Detention would not be disproportionate for them. I also gave consideration to the matters raised in the mitigation &amp; in learned counsel’s submissions and took into account Mr Ng’s plea of guilt as well. All this served to temper the term of Preventive Detention which was due. All considered, I sentenced Mr Ng to a term of 7 years of Preventive Detention and backdated it to take into account the period spent by him in remand. As required by law, a penalty of $2,000/- was also imposed for the corruption charge, together with an order for his disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for life for his driving related offence. This sentence would tide Mr Ng into his mid-fifties before his next release, and it will provide the much-needed respite for the public and even his own family to heal in the meantime. It is hoped that his own admitted impetuousness and impulsivity which is now still afflicting him in his late forties would have left him by that stage.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">OTHER MATTERS:</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following other matters were not considered in sentencing. Mr Ng has however repeatedly referred to them in his many letters of complaint which he has written and sent to various parties about the conduct of his court case after he entered his plea of guilt. Those letters are a matter of record in the case file, and they were referred to me for reference. For completeness, I briefly address the points made.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_22-p2_">■&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he entered his plea of guilt to the charges, Mr Ng started writing letters of complaint about how his case was being handled. In gist, he complained that he was rushed into entering his plea and was also not given enough time to prepare his case in mitigation. In terms of timing, it is noteworthy that this complaint was made by him only after it became apparent which sentencing option was being considered by this court. The record of proceedings will show this complaint to be inaccurate and misleading. The fact of the matter is that Mr Ng’s case had a context when it was fixed before me originally for trial. By that stage, Mr Ng’s case was already almost 4 years old, and it had gone through the reviews of different judges at multiple pre-trial conferences. During that time, he also had the benefit of 4 different counsel coming on-board to render him their opinions and advice. The matter also went through multiple rounds of representations. When the occasion finally arrived for him to elect his plea on the charges (the same ones alluded to in these grounds), he opted to claim trial to them, and the matter was fixed for trial originally before a different district court. Mr Ng then appeared before that trial court but changed his plea and pleaded guilty to the charges instead. He however sought multiple adjournments thereafter to prepare his mitigation, and the matter became protracted over months. That long sentencing process was ultimately unsuccessful when Mr Ng later qualified his plea in his mitigation, and the matter had to be refixed afresh for trial again. With that context for the matter being referred to me, it was incumbent on this court to ensure that Mr Ng knew exactly what his plea options were and their potential consequences and take measures as appropriate to prevent a repeat of what went on before. For that reason, the record will show that Mr Ng was so informed. After being so informed, Mr Ng chose to accept the Prosecution’s re-opened plea offer on the charges, and he pleaded guilty to the 6 proceeded charges as indicated earlier, and he also admitted without qualification to the Statement of Facts for those charges. Mr Ng also then admitted to the balance 6 charges and consented to them being taken into consideration by the court for the purpose of his sentencing, and he also admitted to all his antecedents. Despite what was earlier informed to Mr Ng about the expected court procedures which would apply, when it came to the time for him to offer up his mitigation, he sought an adjournment instead to prepare it. I did not agree to it. Given the context earlier recounted, there was every reason to be concerned that any adjournment would result in the proceedings being again protracted and at risk of becoming undone again. Moreover, this was hardly a situation where Mr Ng was unprepared because it was all unfamiliar territory. The case history shows that he had been in that precise situation before and that he had been given <em>months</em> previously to prepare his mitigation. I told him to offer it up, and if any part of it qualified the plea, the trial would proceed. In the end, Mr Ng capably offered up in his mitigation – which I had set out earlier and which I had considered.</a></p><a id="p1_22-p2_"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_"></a><a id="p1_22-p2__4">■&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ng’s next complaint is that this court did not adequately consider his grievance against the DPP handling his case. In gist, Mr Ng’s grievance is that the DPP was guilty of misconduct in her handling of his matter. Mr Ng referred to statements made by the DPP at earlier court sessions and claimed that the DPP had lied to court in relation to Dr Tan’s report. The rest of the specifics in Mr Ng’s complaint against the DPP (together with the DPP’s robust &amp; detailed rebuttal) deserve no further recount because when queried by the court, Mr Ng confirmed that his ultimate concern which he had in raising the point was his desire for Dr Tan’s report to be considered by this court, and I told him that it was already before me and that it would be considered in substance. In these grounds, I have already explained how it affected sentencing. There was no reason for the proceedings to be delayed further just because he was unhappy with the DPP.</a></p><a id="p1_22-p2__4"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2__4"></a><a id="p1_22-p2__5">■&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Ng has complained about the general handling of his case. I understand he has taken issue with my order made on 14<sup>th</sup> October 2022 remanding him into custody for the preparation of the Commissioner’s report. On that day, Mr Ng strenuously sought more time to settle his personal affairs, and I refused because the facts for the charges, together with his record, plus his statement made before me that he would ‘rather commit a very big case’ before coming in to make it worth a Preventive Detention all gave grave cause for concern that further bail was even justified for him. In fact, as it turned out, the bailor (Mr Ng’s elder sister) also subsequently contacted the court to raise her concerns about the conduct of the accused whilst on bail and she wanted to be discharged as his bailor because she did not want him returned into her custody.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a> Further, the Prosecution also subsequently informed this court that fresh reports of further offences had also been received for the brief period when Mr Ng was released on bail, and that he was now under investigations for them. Both of those factors strengthened my assessment that bail ought to be revoked, and I so ordered on 4<sup>th </sup>November 2022. Mr Ng was however granted the time as required thereafter for Mr Wee to take his full instructions and address the court on sentencing.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">CONCLUSION: </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ng was accorded every courtesy and procedural safeguard when his plea was taken on the charges. For the reasons set out in these Grounds, I found that this case called for the imposition of a term of Preventive Detention, and so ordered. He now appeals against that sentence. He is currently serving that said sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"></a><p class="Footnote"><a id="p1_23"><sup></sup></a><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a>Antecedents at serial number 1-5 of the CRO.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>Antecedents at serial number 6-18 of the CRO.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>Antecedents at serial number 19-24 of the CRO.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>Antecedents at serial number 25-44 of the CRO.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_5_1" id="Ftn_5">[note: 5]</a></sup>Antecedents at serial number 45-54 of the CRO.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_6_1" id="Ftn_6">[note: 6]</a></sup>Antecedents at serial number 55-60 of the CRO.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_7_1" id="Ftn_7">[note: 7]</a></sup>Antecedents at serial number 61-64 of the CRO.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_8_1" id="Ftn_8">[note: 8]</a></sup>Antecedents at serial number 65-81 of the CRO.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_9_1" id="Ftn_9">[note: 9]</a></sup>Antecedents at serial number 82-93 of the CRO.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_10_1" id="Ftn_10">[note: 10]</a></sup>NE, 13 October 2022, pages 27-34.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_11_1" id="Ftn_11">[note: 11]</a></sup>Mr Ng reported that he lost his sense of smell and taste in 2013 after he was assaulted by his then brother-in-law (from his first marriage).
