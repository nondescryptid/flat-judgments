She had enticed them to “invest” with her by purporting to offer attractive returns. For PW1 Tam, the AP primarily convinced him by returning him the first “investment” sum of SGD$100,000 with 10% interest in a very short period, and then using her personal details to encash the subsequent SGD$200,000 cheque.

The defence case is that the AP had never made such representations to PW1 Tam, PW13 Soh and her friends or otherwise asked them to invest with her, and disputed in relation to PW1 Tam that the document in P7 is conclusive evidence that monies were extended for the purpose of investment and that there was deception involved in the extension of the monies.</a></p><a id="p1_11-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_11-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the AP had dishonestly induced PW1 Tam (whether directly or indirectly through his associates) and PW13 Soh’s friends to deliver money totalling a sum of SGD$2,160,100 to her.

The defence case is that (i) the AP had obtained a sum of at least SGD$300,000 from PW1 Tam pursuant to a loan agreement with 10% interest payable, and (ii) PW13 Soh had dishonestly induced her friends to deliver the entire sum of SGD$734,000 to herself, not the AP.</a></p><a id="p1_11-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_11-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the AP possessed a dishonest or fraudulent intention and kept the sums of money that were handed over to her.

Their demeanour displayed in Court clearly supports the conclusion that they were witnesses of impeccable veracity. Besides being internally and externally consistent with the extrinsic evidence in their testimonies, they had either not been rigorously cross-examined or had withstood cross examination by the defence which in any case did not mount any concrete challenge to the credibility of all the prosecution witnesses in its submissions. All the material evidence of the prosecution witnesses relevant to prove the present charges preferred against the AP remained unshakened during their cross-examination.

When it was put to PW1 Tam that he had continued to give to the AP funds despite not receiving repayment because he was her “partner” and not because of any deception, PW1 Tam unequivocally disagreed. Instead, he explained that he continued to extend funds to her because she claimed that the prior funds were frozen in the bank and she offered him the short term scheme. Even though it was suggested to PW1 Tam repeatedly that the money he extended was for a different purpose as a business partner, he was very clear that it was a result of the AP’s deception in alleging a scheme of providing funds to gamblers in the casino.</a></p><a id="p1_14-p2_a-p3_ii"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_a-p3_ii"></a><a id="p1_14-p2_a-p3_iii">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW1 Tam also consistently explained that he had persisted in giving money to the AP because he trusted her<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a>. In fact, this was why he failed to keep any formal record of his transactions with her<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>.

Subsequently, he only decided to go the police almost a year later when he was convinced by reports of others being cheated by the AP.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_a-p3_iv">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW1 Tam’s evidence at trial was also internally consistent with his prior versions of events. First, contrary to the defence submission, PW1 Tam’s evidence at trial was internally consistent with his initial recount to the police in his First Information Report (Exhibit P1). There, he similarly recounted being deceived by two schemes: first, “an overseas investment in China” and then “another investment opportunity, whereby payouts and profits are distributed on a daily basis”, although the “type of investment was similar”. Additionally, he also recounted that the catalyst for the second scheme offering quicker returns was the AP’s claim that funds were “frozen in a bank in China”. Finally, the AP’s estimate of the total sum was approximately SGD$1.24 million, which is close enough to the estimate of SGD$1.4 million and eventual amount in the charge (SGD$1,426,100). The estimated sum of SGD$800,000 attributed to the main China scheme and the lesser estimated sum of SGD$400,000 attributed to the short-term scheme was also internally consistent with his memory of the proportions of money he “invested”. As PW1 Tam had testified in Court, he had not performed precise calculations of the total sum at the time of Exhibit P1, and hence his roughly consistent recount in fact goes to show his internal consistency even based on estimation.</a></p><a id="p1_14-p2_a-p3_iv"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_a-p3_iv"></a><a id="p1_14-p2_a-p3_v">(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW1 Tam’s evidence at trial was also internally consistent with his own recount to the AP over the phone conversations, which were translated and transcribed in Exhibit P5. In those calls, he makes most references to the “China side”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a>, but also makes some references to the “Malaysia” side<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>. This is internally consistent with his understanding that most of the money was in the main China scheme. His enquiry about “lift(ing) the freeze”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> in China is also internally consistent with his understanding that his money was being frozen in an account in China. Finally, his recount of the sum being “more than 1,200,000”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> and “SGD 1,230,000”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> is roughly consistent with his estimate at trial. Moreover, given the lack of precise calculation at the time, it would be more accurate to compare his estimate to that given in Exhibit P1, which is very similar (SGD 1,240,000). PW1 Tam was also very clear that the money was owed to him by making constant references to it and seeking explanations from the AP<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>, which is internally consistent with him being dishonestly induced to believe that he was investing with the AP.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW1 Tam’s testimony was externally consistent with the exhibits and oral testimony of the other prosecution witnesses as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_14-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_14-p2_b-p3_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW1 Tam’s testimony was externally consistent with the prosecution exhibits. PW1 Tam’s testimony about the estimated SGD$1.4 million that he handed over to the AP was corroborated by the comprehensive documentary record (Exhibit P7<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a>) of the sums of money that he and his family members and friends had handed to the AP for the purpose of investment<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>. He had prepared this document by cross-referencing his personal contemporaneous records with objective bank records<sup>32</sup>. In turn, Exhibit P7 was corroborated by PW1 Tam’s bank statement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>.and reproductions of cheques issued by him and his family members<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>. Not only were the sums correctly recorded, PW1 Tam’s records of particulars like the cheque numbers, the dates, and the origins of the respective sums were accurate when compared with the objective records. Notably, he had prepared Exhibit P7 without reference to most of the reproductions of the cheques that were <em>subsequently</em> obtained from the respective banks, suggesting that PW1 Tam had in fact kept an accurate personal record. Consequently, this lends great credibility to Exhibit P7, which in turn confers reliability on the total sum of SGD$1,426,100 from Exhibit P7 that was extended to the AP for investment.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_b-p3_ii">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW1 Tam’s evidence was also corroborated by the AP’s version in the phone conversations transcribed in Exhibit P5. The AP referred to both the “China side”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a> and other money dealings in “Malaysia”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span>, which corresponded to PW1 Tam’s recounts of the two schemes. The AP also repeatedly raised and discussed the issue of chasing and receiving money or payment, including repayment by instalments<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span>. The AP’s continued engagement with the PW1 Tam over these monetary issues and the ostensible use of the collective pronoun (“we”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span>, “us”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span>, “our”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span>) corroborated PW1 Tam’s evidence that he had handed the money to the AP for the purpose of investment. The AP also acknowledged and did not dispute the sums of money when highlighted by PW1 Tam (1,230,000, more than 1,200,000), which constituted implicit endorsement of the sum involved. This is further corroborated by the discussion of repayment in significant instalments of “tens of thousands of dollars, 100,000 or 80,000”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span>. The AP’s clear understanding and engagement with PW1 Tam’s reference to the “seizure”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> and “(judicial) freeze”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> in China corroborates his evidence that she had claimed that his money had been frozen in an account in China, which she used as an excuse to dishonestly induce him to hand over more money. In this regard, I rejected the defence submission on the need for the prosecution to produce evidence of any bank account belonging to the AP in China since this was merely the AP’s claim which she was unable to prove.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_b-p3_iii">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW1 Tam’s evidence was also corroborated by the oral testimonies of no less than eight family members and friends<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a>. All eight witnesses had no motive to lie. None of PW1 Tam’s family members and friends contradicted his evidence. While some of them knew slightly more about the AP’s representations and intended purpose of the monies, most of them simply extended money to PW1 Tam as a personal loan requested by him out of goodwill and trust. This was consistent with PW1 Tam’s evidence that he did not necessarily share about the scheme when asking for money, but instead sought personal loans for which he bore personal responsibility. For most of them, they displayed independent personal recollection (e.g. in relation to the sums of money given and/or mode of transfer to PW1 Tam) without the aid of the documentary exhibits. Additionally, for those who knew more about the situation like PW3 Tam Fei Fong and PW4 Tam Fei Wen, their recounts of meeting the AP to chase for repayment was externally corroborated by Exhibit P45 (note).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW1 Tam was an honest and forthright witness in his demeanour.

In response to the defence counsel’s suggestion that his version was illogical, he explained the basis for his trust. First, his trust was cultivated after he received 10% returns from the AP as she had promised on the first loan of SGD$100,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span>.

Third, he was aware that she had some familial roots in Singapore<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span>, which suggested she would not run away. Fourth, he never thought that the AP would harm or cheat him given their good personal relationship<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span>. His trust was not only genuine, but it was also justified and rational. Ultimately, his trust was also not completely blind; like any rational human being, he still kept some informal personal records<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> (that later was relied upon to create Exhibit P7).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_f">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence submissions do not explicitly address PW1 Tam’s credibility, perhaps due to its misguided focus on Exhibit P7. On the balance of arguments, PW1 Tam’s credibility remains largely intact. Nonetheless, as submitted by the prosecution, there were several isolated claims in the defence submissions that appear to cast doubt on PW1 Tam’s credibility that need to be addressed for completeness as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_14-p2_f"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_f"></a><a id="p1_14-p2_f-p3_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence claim that PW1 Tam’s evidence that he had obtained the three police report numbers from WeChat was an “untrue statement” is completely speculative<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a>.

The assertion that it was untrue because he was “unlikely to have access to all three persons who made the report” is irrelevant because PW1 Tam testified that he did not know these individuals, and it was perfectly plausible that he had gotten them anonymously on a chat group.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_f-p3_ii">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubt appeared to be cast on the reliability of Exhibit P7 because of PW1 Tam’s failure to provide the informal personal records that he relied upon to prepare Exhibit P7<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a>, and a claim that the reliance on Exhibit P7 as a “truthful document” was somehow “one sided”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> However, the fact that PW1 Tam had kept contemporaneous personal records made Exhibit P7 more reliable, and he could explain that he reproduced and tidied the records into Exhibit P7<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span>. There was no identifiable inconsistency between Exhibit P7 and the objective bank records<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span>, and <em>no specific allegation of inaccuracy was made by the defence beyond speculative scepticism.</em> Hence, Exhibit P7 should be taken as reliable and further evidence supporting PW1 Tam’s credibility.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_f-p3_iii">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence appeared to suggest that PW1 Tam was untruthful in failing to disclose that “some of the monies had been refunded” as it was a “fact” that some of the monies were paid direct to the so-called contributors”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a> This point was never put to PW1 Tam in cross-examination, so it is unclear what lack of admission the defence was referring to.

PW13 Soh was very clear that these sums of money were handed over as investments, and not loans<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span>. She testified that the alleged investment scheme offered by the AP was about providing money for Chinese nationals to spend in Singapore<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span>. In return, the AP would offer attractive returns in the range of 5 to 9%<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span>. The AP had also offered more attractive returns to encourage her friends to invest more money<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span>. Her friends’ transactions with the AP in her presence were all done in cash at the AP’s request<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span>. She also testified that these transactions were sometime in November and December 2019<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_15-p2_a-p3_ii">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to the defence submissions, PW13 Soh’s testimony at trial was internally consistent with her previous recount offered in her police report (Exhibit P2). She had reported that she was introduced to the AP to “invest in businesses that she (knew)”, and she gave her SGD$900,000 for this purpose. The purpose of investment into businesses or schemes that were offered by the AP is internally consistent with her evidence at trial. The stated sum of SGD$900,000 is also consistent, because as PW13 Soh clarified at trial, she had mentally included an initial SGD$100,000 (to allegedly help her to deal with her husband and his mistress) that she had given the AP to the stated total of SGD$800,000<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a>. Additionally, PW13 Soh’s recount that the AP had paid back “a total of $71,000 in investment returns” was generally consistent with the fact that there were initial returns that the AP offered, which brought the actual sum handed over to “700 plus thousand” dollars<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span>. Furthermore, the stated returns of “around 10% per month” was consistent with the range of 5 to 9% cited at trial, and also consistent with the cited range of 8-10% in Exhibit P6. The reported time frame of November till December 2019 was also consistent with her evidence at trial, as well as her claim in Exhibit P2 that the returns (deductions) were paid “over a period of 1 month”.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_15-p2_a-p3_iii">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW13 Soh’s testimony was internally consistent on the point that she had “trusted” the AP and referred her friends out of goodwill<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a>. In fact, she only referred her long time friends because she trusted the AP, and in turn she knew that they would trust her<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span>. In her mind, the referral was a win-win opportunity<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_15-p2_a-p3_iv">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW13 Soh could also explain the rational basis for her trust. First, she associated her trust for one ‘Esther’ with the AP<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a>. It was the AP who had cited Esther’s participation in the alleged investment scheme to cultivate her trust<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span>. Nonetheless, she was also clear that it was eventually the AP who made the representations to her about the alleged investment scheme<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span>, not Esther. Second, she was also convinced to trust the AP because she met ‘Big Brother Yi’ (‘Yi Da Ge’), whom the AP had introduced as her friend<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span>. She had witnessed them transacting<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span> and the AP represented that the transactions were part of her business that she asked PW13 Soh to join<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span>. Third, she also placed her trust in their personal relationship and belief in the AP’s good intentions<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span>. The AP had cultivated PW13 Soh’s trust by purporting to be her friend and helping her with her personal matters, which made the AP feel trustworthy<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span>. In fact, PW13 Soh reposed trust in her friendship with the AP thinking that she would not cause her harm, especially as the AP became aware of her personal difficulties after undergoing the divorce<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span>. Finally, she also trusted that the AP would not abscond as her daughter was schooling in Singapore<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_15-p2_a-p3_v">(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW13 Soh had also explained that it was her trust that led her to act her in the way that she did. First, the AP convinced her to transact in cash because she told PW13 Soh that they did not want anything to be seen by the bank<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a>. Despite PW13 Soh’s preference to issue cheques, she trusted the AP and transacted in cash instead<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span>. Second, it was this trust in the AP that led PW13 Soh to agree to interpose herself between the AP and PW13’s friends to be “responsible” for the debt. She only agreed to take responsibility for sums of money despite her lack of personal benefit because she trusted the AP<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span>, and her subsequent assumption of this responsibility when things went wrong reflected her retrospective recognition of her trust as the basis<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW13 Soh’s testimony was externally consistent with the exhibits and the oral testimonies of her three friends as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_15-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_15-p2_b-p3_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW13 Soh testified that her friends had handed over sums of money in cash to the AP during physical meetups at her house for the purpose of an alleged investment scheme proposed by the AP that offered attractive returns. This was corroborated by several exhibits and the independent oral testimonies of three of her friends, PW17 Marilyn, PW19 Lim and PW20 Tan.</a></p><a id="p1_15-p2_b-p3_i"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_15-p2_b-p3_i"></a><a id="p1_15-p2_b-p3_ii">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW13 Soh’s testimony that the AP was the one who proposed the alleged investment scheme was corroborated by Exhibit P6. It was undisputed that Exhibit P6 showed a screenshot from PW13 Soh’s phone showing some Whatsapp messages and some missed calls from the AP<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_99" id="Ftn_99_1"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a>. The messages proposed a “project” offering “8 to 10 growth percentage points”, and the AP was asking PW13 Soh if she was interested to join her because she was “short of two partners for collaboration”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span>. PW13 Soh testified that this was the original unsolicited offer from the AP<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span>. Even after PW13 Soh ignored the initial messages, the AP was persistent. She “kept contacting” her and “kept mentioning” this investment scheme to her, and cited Esther’s involvement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span>. When PW13 Soh said she had no money to invest, the AP asked her to look for others<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span>, eventually prompting her to refer her long time friends who were looking for avenues for investment<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_104" id="Ftn_104_1"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span>. The date of the message (7 October 2019) also predates all the transactions in November to December 2019, which further corroborated PW13 Soh’s version.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_15-p2_b-p3_iii">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW13 Soh’s testimony that the AP was the one perpetrating the deception in relation to the alleged investment schemes is also corroborated by the agreement documents (Exhibits P34 to P38). In every one of the agreement documents, the AP’s name and signature corresponded to ‘Party A’, who was the party “in charge of the project operation and sourcing of customers”. By contrast, PW13 Soh or her friends would sign as ‘Party B’, who was the party contributing the capital. This corroborated PW13 Soh’s description of the arrangement, and she verified this understanding in the evidence at trial.</a></p><a id="p1_15-p2_b-p3_iii"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_15-p2_b-p3_iii"></a><a id="p1_15-p2_b-p3_iv">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As PW13 Soh had testified, the AP was the one who prepared these agreement documents<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a>, read and explained the terms to her friends<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span> and subsequently received the cash from her friends<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span>. PW13 Soh was merely a witness and did not participate in the transactions<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span>, except to sign on behalf of two of her friends<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_109" id="Ftn_109_1"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span> (Lydia and PW20 Tan). In fact, PW13 Soh recalled that the AP had explained that, since she was the one doing the investment, she and her friends were not to interfere or question her about its operation or returns<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_110" id="Ftn_110_1"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span>. Exhibits P37 and P38 further corroborate PW13 Soh’s claim that the AP had offered more attractive returns in exchange for more investment, as PW17 Marilyn’s rate of return increased from 6% to 7% after she invested an additional SGD$100,000 on top of her original SGD$100,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_111" id="Ftn_111_1"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span>. According to PW13 Soh, this was the similar situation with how PW20 Tan received the eventual returns rate of 9% for SGD$300,000, with a lower rate of 7% offered for her initial investment of SGD$200,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_112" id="Ftn_112_1"><sup>[note: 112]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_15-p2_b-p3_v">(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW13 Soh’s testimony was corroborated by the oral testimonies of her three friends. They could physically identify the AP in Court<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_113" id="Ftn_113_1"><sup>[note: 113]</sup></a>, corroborating their claims that they had met her physically to hand over cash as investment. All three friends repeatedly testified that they had trusted her<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_114" id="Ftn_114_1"><sup>[note: 114]</sup></a></span>, and that she had assumed responsibility for the transactions as the referrer as she claimed due to her trust in the AP<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_115" id="Ftn_115_1"><sup>[note: 115]</sup></a></span>. Nonetheless, they all confirmed that they were dishonestly induced by the AP to hand over the various of sums of money for the purpose of alleged investment, and not for any other purpose<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_116" id="Ftn_116_1"><sup>[note: 116]</sup></a></span>. They all had no doubt that the AP was the one with whom they were investing with<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_117" id="Ftn_117_1"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span>, and consequently to whom they handed over the respective sums of cash <em>witnessed by PW13 Soh</em><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_118" id="Ftn_118_1"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span>. In fact, they offered rather specific recollections of the AP handling the money. PW19 Lim recounted the AP taking out the cash from the envelope and counting it<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_119" id="Ftn_119_1"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span> - she had a distinct memory because the AP counted “very fast” that made PW19 Lim worried that she might have counted wrongly<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_120" id="Ftn_120_1"><sup>[note: 120]</sup></a></span>. Similarly, PW20 Tan testified that the AP had counted the money, and then placed it in her red bag – she had provided a picture (Exhibit P53) that she took as corroborative evidence<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_121" id="Ftn_121_1"><sup>[note: 121]</sup></a></span>. In fact, her memory was distinct enough that she could correct the defence counsel’s incorrect identification of an ‘envelope’ in the picture, which was in fact a piece of paper used for calculations<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_122" id="Ftn_122_1"><sup>[note: 122]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_15-p2_b-p3_vi">(vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oral testimonies of PW13 Soh’s three friends are also highly reliable as they were honest and forthcoming witnesses. They had no reason to lie in Court. In fact, PW19 Lim and PW20 Tan were prominent media personalities who could have done without the risk of media exposure. Nonetheless, they came forward to testify to tell the truth of what happened to the best of their knowledge. It was evident from their testimonies that they did not know the full extent of the alleged investment schemes but reposed their trust in PW13 Soh.

The withdrawal of such large sums of cash from their bank accounts and CPF and even redemption of fixed deposits just before or on the very date of the agreements constitutes highly probative evidence that they were telling the truth. In particular, the withdrawals by PW19 Lim in Exhibits P27 and P28 added up almost exactly to SGD$186,000 (which was the post-deduction sum), and were made on the very morning of the agreement (28 December 2019)<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_127" id="Ftn_127_1"><sup>[note: 127]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_15-p2_b-p3_ix">(ix)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW17 Marilyn’s testimony was further corroborated by two pieces of contemporaneous evidence. First, Exhibit P46 was her personal handwritten record at the time that captured her investment of an extra SGD$100,000 after a month (as shown from Exhibit P37 to P38), as well as the collection of only one month of returns besides the initial deduction. This corroborated PW13 Soh’s testimony that she had repaid one month’s interest with her own money with the intention of trying to buy the AP some time to give her the returns<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_128" id="Ftn_128_1"><sup>[note: 128]</sup></a>. Second, it was undisputed that Exhibit P47 was a picture of a document sent by the AP on 6 February 2020 to PW17 Marilyn after she had handed all the money over to the AP and not received returns. The document described a termination of the “collaboration relationship” due to the coronavirus pandemic causing lockdown in China, resulting in a return of capital<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_129" id="Ftn_129_1"><sup>[note: 129]</sup></a></span>. This further corroborated the testimonies of PW13 Soh and PW17 Marilyn that the AP was the one orchestrating this whole scheme, and they were merely providing capital that the AP purported to return. However, as it turned out, the AP never returned the capital or paid any returns as promised besides the initial deductions.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, I found PW13 Soh to be a credible and truthful witness.

The most striking example was her attempt to bolster her fabricated fear of PW1 Tam. In doing so, the outcome of her fanciful storytelling was a laughable caricature that belonged to fiction and not fact. She simply added more and more menacing details to his alleged unreasonable demand for 20% interest, by claiming that he had triad connections in Geylang<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_139" id="Ftn_139_1"><sup>[note: 139]</sup></a>, threaten to pour sulphuric acid<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_140" id="Ftn_140_1"><sup>[note: 140]</sup></a></span> on people, had different relatives who were officials in China<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_141" id="Ftn_141_1"><sup>[note: 141]</sup></a></span>, in the Singapore police force and the Singapore government<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_142" id="Ftn_142_1"><sup>[note: 142]</sup></a></span>.

In fact, it was this approach that engendered a plethora of internal inconsistencies and revealed a recurring pattern of fabricated stories. The AP’s disingenuity then further came to fore in her approach to dealing with inconsistencies. She displayed her uncanny comfort for bare faced assertions that irreconcilable inconsistencies could co-exist. In other situations, she would simply evade the obvious and assert without basis that things were “different”, or appeal vaguely to “context” to adopt ridiculous and blatantly self-serving interpretations. When backed into a corner, she often prevaricated and simply refused to answer. At times, she would just resort to hollow exhortations of honesty, justice and truth<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_143" id="Ftn_143_1"><sup>[note: 143]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP had made audacious claims against PW1 Tam and PW13 Soh. In the spirit of caricature, her portrayals of PW1 Tam and PW13 Soh yielded an unreasonable moneylender and a shameless criminal respectively, titles which aptly summarized the AP’s stories, but which she refused to confer when confronted with the sheer ridiculousness. In the AP’s world, she had been unfairly treated and exploited by PW1 Tam and PW13 Soh, who had only benefitted from their association with her. However, despite reaping handsome benefits without any reprisal, they were inconceivably possessed to independently launch irrational and sustained vendettas against her by lodging false police reports of cheating, and in the process expose themselves to police investigations and risk losing their benefits. Yet, despite this seemingly unbearable injustice causing her to be in remand for almost two years, the AP never once highlighted that she was being framed. Instead, she told different stories of events at each turn. When allegedly false charges were brought to Court and PW1 Tam and PW13 Soh brazenly told lies in Court, the AP was unbelievably calm and indifferent, and never once confronted them for framing her. Most shockingly, at the end of it all, the AP claimed that she was none the wiser from her answers in the NE reproduced below<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_144" id="Ftn_144_1"><sup>[note: 144]</sup></a>:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2" frame="none" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="10.62%"><col width="89.38%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Q: </p> </td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">…I put it to you that Tam Kwong Yoeng [PW1] and Soh Choon Heong [PW13] are both telling the truth.

reliable given that it accounted for a significant portion of the funds. This serves as further corroborative evidence that there was indeed delivery of property by PW1 Tam and PW13 Soh’s friends to the AP. When confronted with this tracing exercise, the AP had no response. She repeatedly claimed the tracing evidence to be “purely coincidental”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_170" id="Ftn_170_1"><sup>[note: 170]</sup></a>, “unrelated”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_171" id="Ftn_171_1"><sup>[note: 171]</sup></a></span> and “nothing to do with (her)”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_172" id="Ftn_172_1"><sup>[note: 172]</sup></a></span>. As the entries in the tables above show, the connections are no coincidence.

Furthermore, the nail in the coffin is that the gameplay records corresponding to the casino accounts show that there were significant losses sustained by the AP during gameplay. Hence, the logical inference to be drawn is that the AP’s deposits into her casino accounts were traceable to her fraudulent receipt of the various sums of money from PW1 Tam and PW13 Soh’s friends<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_173" id="Ftn_173_1"><sup>[note: 173]</sup></a>.

I agreed with the prosecution that the AP’s different defences respectively to PW1 Tam’s charge and PW13 Soh’s friends’ charges are inherently incredible, and the only logical conclusion to be drawn is that these defences were so inconsistent and unbelievable as they were fabricated and were afterthoughts to explain the incriminating evidence against the AP for the reasons as advocated by the prosecution as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_18-p2_A"> <u>(A) In respect of PW1 Tam’s charge:</u> </a></p><a id="p1_18-p2_A"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_18-p2_A"></a><a id="p1_18-p2_A-p3_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP claimed that she had borrowed at least SGD$300,000 from PW1 Tam on a maximum of four occasions and that she had repaid with 10% interest.

However, instead of the sum of SGD$1,426,100 on at least 24 occasions that she had been charged with, the AP claimed that she received a total of at least SGD$300,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_175" id="Ftn_175_1"><sup>[note: 175]</sup></a></span> on three or four occasions<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_176" id="Ftn_176_1"><sup>[note: 176]</sup></a></span>. While the AP claimed that there may have been more loans, the sum can only reliably be taken as SGD$300,000 as she could only identify three cheques (Exhibits P10, P18 and P22). Furthermore, instead of dishonestly inducing PW1 Tam to hand over the sum of SGD$300,000 by deception, the AP claimed that she had taken the various sums of money from PW1 Tam as loans<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_177" id="Ftn_177_1"><sup>[note: 177]</sup></a></span>. In fact, the AP claimed to have returned the entire sum of alleged loans from PW1 Tam with 10% interest.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_178" id="Ftn_178_1"><sup>[note: 178]</sup></a></span> In other words, the AP alleged that PW1 Tam earned a profit of SGD$30,000 from the loan arrangements<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_179" id="Ftn_179_1"><sup>[note: 179]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_18-p2_A-p3_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP went further to claim that PW1 Tam also took loans from her. There was one other cheque (Exhibit P11) for SGD$18,600 issued by PW1 Tam that was encashed by the AP’s husband, Mr Tan Dai Keng. When confronted with this objective evidence, the AP claimed that this was repayment for a loan that PW1 Tam had taken from her due to cash flow issues<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_180" id="Ftn_180_1"><sup>[note: 180]</sup></a>.

According to the AP, PW1 Tam had made a profit of at least SGD$30,000 in interest payments from extending loans to her and benefited from goodwill loans of SGD$2,300 that he did not repay. Yet, the AP alleged that PW1 Tam fell out with her over a dispute over her failure to pay him SGD$5,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_186" id="Ftn_186_1"><sup>[note: 186]</sup></a></span> and suggested that this had motivated him to make an alleged false police report<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_187" id="Ftn_187_1"><sup>[note: 187]</sup></a></span>. Quite apart from the relatively small sum involved, the AP claimed that this SGD$5,000 was a result of a sudden and unexplained demand of 20% interest for a loan of SGD$50,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_188" id="Ftn_188_1"><sup>[note: 188]</sup></a></span>, in breach of their existing agreement of 10% interest that the AP had been faithfully abiding by<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_189" id="Ftn_189_1"><sup>[note: 189]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_18-p2_A-p3_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP had admitted that the “only dispute”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_190" id="Ftn_190_1"><sup>[note: 190]</sup></a> that she could think of to justify why PW1 Tam might make a false police report was her refusal to pay his unreasonable demand of SGD$5,000.

For completeness, perhaps sensing how unbelievable her version of events sounded during cross-examination, the AP started alluding to mysterious and nebulous claim of “unhappiness” between herself and PW1 Tam<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_192" id="Ftn_192_1"><sup>[note: 192]</sup></a></span>. No weight should be placed on this claim. First, the AP failed to provide any explanation, much less substantiation, of any such alleged “unhappiness”. Second, the AP’s claim of “unhappiness” was a clear afterthought as it was never mentioned previously in her statements or her EIC. Third, the AP did not confront PW1 Tam under cross-examination with this claim of “unhappiness” as a motive for him to make an alleged false police report against her.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_18-p2_A-p3_e">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP herself admitted that her version of events was “ridiculous”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_193" id="Ftn_193_1"><sup>[note: 193]</sup></a> and “illogical”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_194" id="Ftn_194_1"><sup>[note: 194]</sup></a></span>. As the AP had agreed, it simply did not make sense that PW1 Tam would make a false police report against her just to recover SGD$5,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_195" id="Ftn_195_1"><sup>[note: 195]</sup></a></span>, and only choose to do so a whole year after the incident<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_196" id="Ftn_196_1"><sup>[note: 196]</sup></a></span>.

Most pertinently, it was not put to PW1 Tam in cross-examination.

The AP’s assertion that she had borrowed a lesser sum of money (SGD$300,000) on fewer occasions (maximum of four times) is completely unsubstantiated.

The sum of SGD$300,000 was the total sum of the only three cheques for which her personal details were recorded as proof of encashment (i.e. Exhibits P10, P18 and P22). Consequently, the AP was forced to accept that she had indeed encashed these cheques. In fact, for Exhibit P22, the AP also had to accept the eyewitness evidence of PW3 Tam Fei Fong (“<b>PW3 Tam</b>”) who corroborated PW1 Tam’s evidence that she was present to collect the cheque at the hospital<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_207" id="Ftn_207_1"><sup>[note: 207]</sup></a>. It is not a mere coincidence that the AP denied receiving any of the other cheques that were encashed by PW1 Tam or his family members, but selectively admitted to only receiving the three cheques that had her name on them and fabricated a story about taking loans from PW1 Tam to explain them. The AP had embellished and expanded her evidence when she was confronted on this point as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-4"><a id="p1_18-p2_A-p3_h-p4_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP conveniently claimed that she could not have received loans of smaller sums of around “10,000 or 20,000” as PW1 Tam did not extend loans below SGD$50,000<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_208" id="Ftn_208_1"><sup>[note: 208]</sup></a>.

In fact, her evasiveness and expanding evidence when confronted is corroborative of her guilt. By contrast to the AP’s failure to produce any shred of evidence and her admission of making baseless claims, PW1 Tam’s account that the total sum of SGD$1,426,100 was in fact handed over to the AP was substantiated by his own comprehensive records and corroborated by objective evidence and independent oral testimony. Hence, PW1 Tam’s evidence should be preferred over the AP’s evidence and should be accepted by this court.</a></p><a id="p1_18-p2_A-p3_i"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_18-p2_A-p3_i"></a><a id="p1_18-p2_A-p3_j">(j)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accepted the prosecution submission that the AP’s claim of alleged loans was internally inconsistent and constantly evolving. She had offered internally inconsistent explanations of the alleged loans that she claimed to have taken from PW1 Tam. The most glaring inconsistencies were in relation to the loan of SGD$200,000 where the AP offered at least three different versions across (i) her statements<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_222" id="Ftn_222_1"><sup>[note: 222]</sup></a>; (ii) her examination-in-chief (“<b>EIC</b>”); and (iii) her cross-examination (“<b>Cross-ex</b>”). Essentially, the AP gave inconsistent accounts regarding the intended recipient(s), the purpose, the agreement, and the arrangements made for the alleged loan. The only logical conclusion for the AP’s inability to get these basic details straight was that she was simply fabricating them as an afterthought.

In fact, the AP even acknowledged PW1 Tam’s allegations<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_261" id="Ftn_261_1"><sup>[note: 261]</sup></a></span> and tried to explain the situation and placate him<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_262" id="Ftn_262_1"><sup>[note: 262]</sup></a></span>.

In other words, she used different explanations to distance herself from PW1 Tam’s allegations. These explanations must, as submitted by the prosecution, be rejected as entirely self-serving as these claims are directly contradicted by the plain and contextual meanings of the phone conversations; no evidence was provided to substantiate any of these claims; and these ridiculous interpretations of the phone conversations by the AP were never put to PW1 Tam in cross-examination, presumably because they would be rejected in their entirely.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_B"> <u>(B) As regards PW13 Soh’s friends’ charges :</u> </a></p><a id="p1_18-p2_B"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_18-p2_B"></a><a id="p1_18-p2_B-p3_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agreed with the prosecution that the AP’s defences to PW13’s friends’ charges were fabricated, inconsistent and unbelievable as afterthoughts for the reasons as submitted by the prosecution as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_18-p2_B-p3_a"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_18-p2_B-p3_a"></a><a id="p1_18-p2_B-p3_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP’s claim was that PW13 Soh had used the AP as a middleman to manipulate her friends into giving her SGD$734,000.

According to the AP, PW13 Soh had successfully used the AP as a front to take SGD$734,000 from her friends. In fact, she claimed that she had even personally lent PW13 Soh a total of SGD$13,000 out of goodwill to help her in her alleged financial difficulty<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_280" id="Ftn_280_1"><sup>[note: 280]</sup></a></span>. Yet, as supposedly benefitting to the tune of SGD$747,000 from the AP directly and indirectly, PW13 Soh then inexplicably makes a police report to frame the AP for cheating her and her friends. If the AP’s version were true, it simply did not make sense that PW13 Soh would make a false police report to frame the AP, knowing that the AP would simply tell the police the truth that would expose her to criminal investigations instead<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_281" id="Ftn_281_1"><sup>[note: 281]</sup></a></span>. Moreover, according to the AP, PW13 Soh had already benefitted by taking the money<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_282" id="Ftn_282_1"><sup>[note: 282]</sup></a></span>. When confronted with the sheer ridiculousness of her claims, the AP was evasive<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_283" id="Ftn_283_1"><sup>[note: 283]</sup></a></span> and engaged in further baseless speculation<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_284" id="Ftn_284_1"><sup>[note: 284]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_18-p2_B-p3_iii">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the AP’s claims are even more unbelievable from the objective observation of the respective demeanours of PW13 Soh and the AP. While PW13 Soh presented as rather simple and forthcoming in nature<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_285" id="Ftn_285_1"><sup>[note: 285]</sup></a>, the AP was evasive and cautious<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_286" id="Ftn_286_1"><sup>[note: 286]</sup></a></span>.

The AP ’s reaction to what is in essence an utter betrayal was also unbelievably calm and indifferent. If the AP’s version were true, it would only make sense that she would be indignant and insisting that the truth be uncovered. On the contrary, she was nonchalant<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_288" id="Ftn_288_1"><sup>[note: 288]</sup></a></span>, irrationally understanding<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_289" id="Ftn_289_1"><sup>[note: 289]</sup></a></span> and engaged in indifferent and baseless speculation<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_290" id="Ftn_290_1"><sup>[note: 290]</sup></a></span>.

Hence, as submitted by the prosecution, the only logical conclusion to be drawn from the inconsistency of her reaction with the reasonable response to her claims is that the AP’s version must be rejected as untrue.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_18-p2_B-p3_iv">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agreed with the prosecution that the AP’s claim that she trusted PW13 Soh’s ability to repay alleged loans that she had taken from her friends was an unsubstantiated and self-serving fabrication. The AP’s version essentially hinged on her assertion that she believed in PW13 Soh’s ability to pay. However, she offered no evidence in support of this alleged belief, not even any correspondence between herself and PW13 Soh to show any of the representations that she alleged PW13 Soh had made. In fact, when pressed for substantiation, her attempts at explaining her basis for such a belief were internally inconsistent as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_18-p2_B-p3_iv"> </a><p class="Judg-4"><a id="p1_18-p2_B-p3_iv"></a><a id="p1_18-p2_B-p3_iv-p4_1">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP claimed that PW13 Soh needed to borrow money from her friends for her personal expenses because she was in financial difficulty. In fact, she cited some rather hefty expenses<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_293" id="Ftn_293_1"><sup>[note: 293]</sup></a>. However, she then claimed that she placed reliance on PW13 Soh’s assurance that she could liquidate assets like her car if she needed to raise funds to repay her friends.

Conversely, if PW13 Soh was in such financial difficulty that she was so desperate to deceive her friends to fund her lifestyle, surely the AP would not be able to rely on her bare assurances of being able to repay these loans.

The AP’s claim that PW13 Soh was taking loans to invest is inconsistent with her previous claim that PW13 Soh needed these loans for her personal expenses. Furthermore, it does not make sense that the AP could credibly believe in PW13 Soh’s ability to repay the loans by taking on even more financial risk by investment, much less in the Nanning Project that the AP herself shunned due to her lack of faith<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_300" id="Ftn_300_1"><sup>[note: 300]</sup></a></span>. It appears that this claim of investment was a convenient afterthought to suggest possible growth of funds to attempt to justify her belief in PW13 Soh’s ability to repay the loans, as opposed to mere constant outflow for expenses.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_18-p2_B-p3_v">(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP’s claim of PW13 Soh’s manipulation was internally inconsistent and constantly evolving.

Ironically, this only served to clarify on the record the <em>artificial</em> and <em>illusionary</em> line that the AP was futilely trying to draw (e.g. willingness to admit she had made representations about “business”, “service”, and even “profit”, but selectively rejecting the language of “investment”<sup>in the charges<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_345" id="Ftn_345_1"><sup>[note: 345]</sup></a></span>). The AP’s attempt at non-existent <em>technical</em> distinction in the face of overwhelming <em>substantive</em> similarity of the representations must be rejected as self-serving. To further illustrate this point, the near-identical substance of the AP’s evidence to PW1 Tam’s testimony by disregarding the self-serving terminology of “loans” and “interest” is exemplified in the AP’s cross-examination in the following excerpts from the NE:</sup></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-3">Q: …you said these <em>loans</em> were <b>for your </b><b><u>China friends</u></b><b>, those who come to spend or </b><b><u>gamble </u></b><b>in the casino, and then you </b><b><u>earn service fees</u></b>, right?</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, <b>correct</b>.</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And <b>it is because of these </b><b><u>service fees </u></b><b>that you </b><b><u>pay 10% </u></b><em>interest</em> to Tam Kwong Yoeng?</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Correct</b> <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_346" id="Ftn_346_1"><sup>[note: 346]</sup></a></span> .

Hence, the only dispute remaining is whether the representations were true. On this point, the defence effectively conceded that the representations were untrue, perhaps in a misguided focus on trying to draw illusory distinctions.

It is indisputable that the truth of the AP’s representations (i.e. whether such a business or investment in fact existed) would be <u>entirely within her personal knowledge</u>. As shown above, the AP had effectively admitted to victims’ recount of her representations and subsequently failed to provide any evidence or explanation to substantiate the alleged truth of these representations <em>despite being made painfully aware of the need to do so</em>. Hence, the only logical conclusion, as submitted by the prosecution, is that the AP had <em>knowingly and intentionally</em> made false representations to the victims. Consequently, assuming that the said false representations had induced the victims to hand over monies to the AP (directly or indirectly), the AP’s intention to cause wrongful gain to herself and/or wrongful loss to them could be inferred, as there was in fact no business as she had claimed.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""> <b>PW1 TAM’S CASE AGAINST THE AP</b> </a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_19-p2_a_1">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence clearly shows that there was inducement applied by the AP on PW1 Tam to deliver monies as a result of her deception (i.e. false representations). In fact, the AP effectively admitted to the inducement in her own evidence. PW1 Tam consistently and clearly testified that he was induced by the AP’s representations about alleged investment schemes involving PRC customers to hand over monies<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_359" id="Ftn_359_1"><sup>[note: 359]</sup></a>.

Critically, PW1 Tam’s recount of the representations that induced him to hand over monies was undisputed by the defence. He displayed credibility and believability by being able to explain the <em>basis for his inducement</em>. He detailed a chronological recount of the representations relating to the two schemes to illustrate his state of mind<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_361" id="Ftn_361_1"><sup>[note: 361]</sup></a></span>, particularly the AP’s claim of “frozen” accounts to propose the “short term” scheme that achieved the dual purpose of stalling the outstanding sum while extracting further sum of money. To the extent that the defence makes suggestions about certain gaps or inability to recall in his recount, particularly on non-material points, I have rejected them as “adequate allowance must be accorded to the human fallibility in retention and recollection”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_362" id="Ftn_362_1"><sup>[note: 362]</sup></a></span>, especially when a significant period of time has lapsed (at least 5 years in the present case.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b_2">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW1 Tam’s evidence of inducement is undisputed for three reasons as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_19-p2_b_2"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_19-p2_b_2"></a><a id="p1_19-p2_b-p3_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At trial, PW1 Tam’s evidence of inducement was <u>unchallenged under cross-examination</u>.

The AP’s own recount of the representations was at best a more vague and general version of PW1 Tam’s recount. Notably, the AP admitted to the <em>causal link</em> between her representations about her alleged ‘business’ and returns in relation to PW1 Tam’s delivery of money<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_365" id="Ftn_365_1"><sup>[note: 365]</sup></a>, which corroborates PW1 Tam’s evidence of inducement. Furthermore, the AP’s own claim that PW1 Tam wanted to join or participate in her alleged ‘business’<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_366" id="Ftn_366_1"><sup>[note: 366]</sup></a></span> further corroborated PW1 Tam’s extent of inducement that he was not satisfied with only handing over monies, but also wanting to be directly involved.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_19-p2_b-p3_iii">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW1 Tam’s evidence of inducement was <u>not directly confronted in the defence submissions</u>. Prima facie, the defence summary of PW1 Tam’s evidence<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_367" id="Ftn_367_1"><sup>[note: 367]</sup></a> is erroneous. Given the lack of citations from the Notes of Evidence, the basis of the submissions are unclear. In any case, PW1 Tam did not testify that there was “<em>a loan which carried an interest or commission</em>” – he had clearly testified that the monies were all handed over for the purpose of the business or investment.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c_3">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only tangential allusion to this issue of inducement in the defence argument was that PW1 Tam’s evidence allegedly “<em>defies logic</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_368" id="Ftn_368_1"><sup>[note: 368]</sup></a>. The suggestion appears to be that PW1 Tam could not logically have been induced by the AP’s representations to hand over such a large sum of monies consisting of at least 24 transfers over the course of about 6 months, especially since he claimed that the AP had not given any returns as promised. As submitted by the prosecution, PW1 Tam’s evidence was, on the contrary, entirely logical and internally consistent for the following reasons:</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_19-p2_c-p3_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence has effectively made an argument against its own case and did nothing to knock the internal consistency or logic of PW1 Tam’s evidence. The defence submissions clearly premised its analysis on the assumption that the monies extended by PW1 Tam to the AP <em>were for the purpose of “loans”</em> (see also “lending money” and “owing money”)<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_369" id="Ftn_369_1"><sup>[note: 369]</sup></a>. The claim that the monies extended by PW1 Tam were “loans” was <em>made by the AP, not PW1 Tam</em>. In fact, he adamantly resisted even a hint of such a characterization<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_370" id="Ftn_370_1"><sup>[note: 370]</sup></a></span>. Consequently, following the defence argument, PW1 Tam’s behaviour “defies logic” <em>according to the AP’s version of events</em>. PW1 Tam’s evidence makes no sense in the context of extending loans to the AP, but it makes perfect sense in the context of being deceived into extending monies for the purpose of investment. Not only did the defence argument fail to attack the prosecution’s case, but it also effectively scored an own goal.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_19-p2_c-p3_ii">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To dispense with this issue of internal consistency conclusively, <u>the</u> evidence unequivocally rebuts the strongest version of what the defence argument <em>could have been</em>. The defence argument would only have any force in challenging the “logic” of PW1 Tam’s behaviour if they had provided analysis of the lack of internal consistency based on PW1 Tam’s own account (i.e. investment). Accordingly, what the defence argument arguably should have been was that it did not make sense that PW1 Tam would hand over such a large sum of money over a course of several months <em>if his evidence of inducement were true</em> (i.e. he was induced to hand over monies for investment, and <em>not loans</em>). However, the evidence shows that PW1 Tam’s claim of his inducement by investment is logical as it is both internally and externally consistent.</a></p><a id="p1_19-p2_c-p3_ii"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_19-p2_c-p3_ii"></a><a id="p1_19-p2_c-p3_iii">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP’s cultivation of PW1 Tam’s trust and subsequent manipulation explained his behaviour. First, PW1 Tam’s trust was cultivated by the AP<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_371" id="Ftn_371_1"><sup>[note: 371]</sup></a>. He was internally consistent across his EIC and cross-examination in explaining and defending his basis for trust in the AP based on the initial transactions<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_372" id="Ftn_372_1"><sup>[note: 372]</sup></a></span>. PW1 Tam’s behaviour could be explained by the AP’s manipulation. She had employed manipulation strategies of creating artificial urgency (“urgently”<sup><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_373" id="Ftn_373_1"><sup>[note: 373]</sup></a></span>, “hurriedly”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_374" id="Ftn_374_1"><sup>[note: 374]</sup></a></span>, “quickly”, “chase”<sup><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_375" id="Ftn_375_1"><sup>[note: 375]</sup></a></span>) and scarcity (competition with others)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_376" id="Ftn_376_1"><sup>[note: 376]</sup></a></span> in demanding further sums of money from PW1 Tam. This explained the catalyst for the PW1 Tam’s frequent and regular delivery of monies despite lack of returns. This also explained the undocumented cash transactions<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_377" id="Ftn_377_1"><sup>[note: 377]</sup></a></span> as she often claimed she needed the funds <em>in cash</em> urgently and had no time to encash cheques<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_378" id="Ftn_378_1"><sup>[note: 378]</sup></a></span>. This also explained why PW1 Tam was so pressed for funds that he took loans from his friends and family members to give to the AP for the purpose of investment that he believed he would eventually recoup.</sup></sup></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_d_4">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW1 Tam’s evidence on inducement is also logical from the perspective of external consistency. First, the testimonies of his eight family members and friends corroborated the fact that PW1 Tam was dishonestly induced to hand over monies for the purpose of investment, and not loans. In fact, this can be seen from the defence respective summaries of their evidence in the defence submissions. Fundamentally, all of them testified that they handed over monies to PW1 Tam as personal loans. This corroborated PW1 Tam’s testimony about taking personal loans for the purpose of investment. There was no mention of them investing in any moneylending business which the AP alleged PW1 Tam was running; in fact, when asked about it, they denied any knowledge of such moneylending business<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_379" id="Ftn_379_1"><sup>[note: 379]</sup></a>. For some who knew slightly more like his sisters or closer friends, they clearly recounted their understanding that PW1 Tam introduced the AP as his “business partner”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_380" id="Ftn_380_1"><sup>[note: 380]</sup></a></span> with whom he was doing “investment”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_381" id="Ftn_381_1"><sup>[note: 381]</sup></a></span>, which corroborated PW1 Tam’s evidence that he was induced to handed monies over for investment, not as loans. In fact, five of the eight witnesses testified that they had personally met the AP<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_382" id="Ftn_382_1"><sup>[note: 382]</sup></a></span>, with their accounts being mutually<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_383" id="Ftn_383_1"><sup>[note: 383]</sup></a></span> and externally corroborated<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_384" id="Ftn_384_1"><sup>[note: 384]</sup></a></span>. These aspects of their evidence were unchallenged in cross examination and also similarly undisputed in the defence submissions<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_385" id="Ftn_385_1"><sup>[note: 385]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_e_5">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the repeated emphasis on the witnesses’ recount of PW1 Tam’s stated purpose being for a <em>business</em> or <em>venture</em> with his <em>partner</em> in the defence submissions appears to help the prosecution case, rather than support the defence case about loans. It does not make sense that PW1 Tam would bring his family members and friends to meet the AP and introduce if he were simply extending loans to her, as opposed to his desire to introduce them to his partner in an investment or even a ‘joint venture’. This suggests the defence concession of a key point of external corroboration in relation to PW1 Tam’s inducement.</a></p><a id="p1_19-p2_e_5"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_e_5"></a><a id="p1_19-p2_f_6">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that PW1 Tam was induced by representations about investments, as opposed to loans, is clear from the objective record in Exhibit P5, which is a transcript of Exhibit P3 (audio recordings of phone conversations between PW1 Tam and the AP) and corresponding to Exhibit P4 (screenshot of call logs). The fact of inducement was corroborated by <em>both PW1 Tam<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></em></a><em><a href="#Ftn_386" id="Ftn_386_1"><sup>[note: 386]</sup></a> and the AP<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_387" id="Ftn_387_1"><sup>[note: 387]</sup></a></span></em> in the calls.

In the first place, beyond a nebulous and generic claim of inauthenticity, it is unclear what the defence claim is. It is undisputed from Exhibit PS1A that the audio recordings were phone conversations occurred between the AP and PW1 Tam between 30 October 2017 and 21 February 2018<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_390" id="Ftn_390_1"><sup>[note: 390]</sup></a>. Hence, this forecloses any challenge about the identities of the individuals in the recordings. It is further undisputed that there is chain of custody of Exhibit P3 from PW1 Tam to PW5 IO Lim Ming Wei (“<b>PW5 IO Lim</b>”), and then subsequently to PW2 Chan for transcription was also undisputed in Exhibit PS1A<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_391" id="Ftn_391_1"><sup>[note: 391]</sup></a></span>.

As Exhibit PS1A (Statement of Agreed Facts dated 10 February 2022) contains agreed facts between parties, any assertion in the defence submissions contrary to the facts contained in Exhibit PS1A should consequently be rejected by this Court.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_h_8">(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the defence submissions should be considered as further evidence of the sheer disingenuity of the AP in making baseless self-serving claims. This is clear from the defence failure to raise any concerns with authenticity earlier. The defence was served a copy of the audio recordings as part of the prosecution’s supplementary bundle. Subsequently, the Court was stood down for extensive periods of time for the defence to take comprehensive instructions on the audio recordings. Thereafter, there were extensive negotiations in relation to the Statement of Agreement Facts (Exhibit PS1A). Finally, the audio recordings were played during PW1 Tam’s EIC in the AP’s presence. Throughout this entire sequence, the defence never raised even a hint of concern about authenticity.</a></p><a id="p1_19-p2_h_8"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_h_8"></a><a id="p1_19-p2_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the defence first raised suggestions of authenticity issues during cross examination of PW5 IO Lim, it was clear that these suggestions were speculative and opportunistic with <em>no specific reference to any portion or aspect of the recordings</em><span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_393" id="Ftn_393_1"><sup>[note: 393]</sup></a>.

PW1 Tam’s testimony regarding this sum of money is internally consistent<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_399" id="Ftn_399_1"><sup>[note: 399]</sup></a> and externally corroborated by objective documentary exhibits<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_400" id="Ftn_400_1"><sup>[note: 400]</sup></a></span>. Both his testimony and the documentary exhibits are then further corroborated by oral testimonies of his family members and friends who came to Court to verify their contribution to the total sum of SGD $1,426,100<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_401" id="Ftn_401_1"><sup>[note: 401]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_l">(l)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence case is very unclear. As a preliminary matter, the defence has failed to resolve the basic issue of whether the dealings between PW1 Tam and the AP were a “joint venture” or “moneylending”. These two case theories are mutually exclusive, and since one or both must be lies, the defence advancement of two inconsistent versions must be seen as corroborative of her guilt.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_402" id="Ftn_402_1"><sup>[note: 402]</sup></a> When the defence put its case to the prosecution witnesses, including PW1 Tam, it was that the monies were extended as a “joint venture”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_403" id="Ftn_403_1"><sup>[note: 403]</sup></a></span>. The defence did not define the term in trial, as highlighted by this court<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_404" id="Ftn_404_1"><sup>[note: 404]</sup></a></span>, and subsequently also failed to do so in its submissions. Hence, it can only be assumed that the ordinary meaning of “joint venture” should be adopted, which was a business enterprise that two or more people enter a temporary partnership to work on together<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_405" id="Ftn_405_1"><sup>[note: 405]</sup></a></span>. In fact, this appeared to be consistent with the usage by learned defence counsel, as his questions suggested it related to PW1 Tam’s “responsibility” to account for the loans from his family members and friends<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_406" id="Ftn_406_1"><sup>[note: 406]</sup></a></span>. Subsequently, this term “joint venture” was <em>completely abandoned</em> in the AP’s own evidence. Instead, the AP went on a separate tangent and claimed that she had merely taken loans from PW1 Tam, whom she alleged was running a moneylending business and charging her interest for extending loans<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_407" id="Ftn_407_1"><sup>[note: 407]</sup></a></span>. As it turns out, she claimed a dispute arose over the amount of interest to be paid, as opposed to any issues relating to joint ventures or business partnerships.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_m">(m)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence submissions also similarly advanced inconsistent cases. On one hand, in attempting to rebut the evidence of tracing, it was suggested that the dealings between PW1 Tam and the AP was “a case where the cheque was handed to the AP as part of the <em>joint venture</em>” as they were “<em>business partners</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_408" id="Ftn_408_1"><sup>[note: 408]</sup></a>. Furthermore, this appeared to be the implication of the defence citation of various testimonies of the prosecution witnesses in its submission that advanced a similar case. However, the defence summary of the AP’s evidence<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_409" id="Ftn_409_1"><sup>[note: 409]</sup></a></span> contained no analysis in harmonizing the two versions of “joint venture” or “moneylending”/ “loans”. The logical inference, as submitted by the prosecution, that can be drawn by the defence advancement of these irreconcilable versions is that they are both in fact untrue and serve to corroborate the AP’s guilt. There is simply no scope for harmonization of these two accounts. The only commonality that these two accounts have is that they are both self-serving adaptations of the truth. The truth was that PW1 Tam was never a business or joint venture partner with the AP. He was also never a moneylender who earned interest through loans. Instead, the truth was that he <em>believed</em> himself to have been a <em>business or joint venture partner</em> as result of the AP’s deception, but even this conception of the business or joint venture partnership was carefully manipulated by the AP to restrict PW1 Tam’s role in the alleged business or joint venture as a provider of capital, <em>effectively</em> playing the role of a <em>moneylender</em>. As the AP had testified, PW1 Tam wanted to increase his involvement in the alleged business or joint venture by meeting and servicing the Chinese customers, but the AP froze him out. Nonetheless, taken the defence case at its highest, the amount put to PW1 Tam<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_410" id="Ftn_410_1"><sup>[note: 410]</sup></a></span> was largely consistent with the amount alleged by the AP – SGD $300,000 which is simply a convenient and self-serving claim based on the objectively traceable total from the three cheques personally encashed by the AP (i.e. Exhibits P10, P18 and P22).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_n">(n)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only defence argument in support of the claim of SGD $300,000 is that the AP had “maintained the same version” in her statements (i.e. Exhibits D4, D5, D6 and D7) as her version in Court<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_411" id="Ftn_411_1"><sup>[note: 411]</sup></a> which is unsubstantiated and patently inaccurate in view of the irreconcilable inconsistencies in her versions offered in her statements and at trial<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_412" id="Ftn_412_1"><sup>[note: 412]</sup></a></span>. The defence approach of only admitting to directly traceable cheques explains the inconsistency of the defence case. As noted by the AP in her cross-examination<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_413" id="Ftn_413_1"><sup>[note: 413]</sup></a></span> and highlighted in the defence submissions<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_414" id="Ftn_414_1"><sup>[note: 414]</sup></a></span>, she did not have access to all the cheques presented at trial during her statements. It appears that the AP thus based it on her memory, but she could not be sure about how much could be objectively traced back to her. As such, this explained why the AP had initially recounted a lesser number of “loans” in her first statement Exhibit D4 (<u>only</u> two loans of SGD $200,000 and SGD $50,000), opening the possibility of more “loans” in her second statement in Exhibit D5 (two to three loans, including SGD $20,000 or SGD $30,000 which she denied at trial<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_415" id="Ftn_415_1"><sup>[note: 415]</sup></a></span>), leaving the possibility completely open in her CFD Exhibit PS5 (no specification of number or amount of loans except SGD $200,000), and only finally committing to three loans based on the final evidence at trial (SGD $200,000, SGD $50,000 x 2 based on the cheques). None of these are the truth, but instead are attempts by the AP to align her version with the objective evidence. The defence submissions simply have no explanation of these inconsistencies. The repetition of the AP’s self-serving claim that she remembered wrongly because she had simply repaid every loan is pitiful and pointless<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_416" id="Ftn_416_1"><sup>[note: 416]</sup></a></span>. The defence submissions that the AP had returned the sum of SGD $300,000 with 10% interest with a dispute arising over an extra 10% for SGD $50,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_417" id="Ftn_417_1"><sup>[note: 417]</sup></a></span> must also be summarily rejected as there is simply no supporting evidence and it is simply unbelievable<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_418" id="Ftn_418_1"><sup>[note: 418]</sup></a></span> as such an alleged situation is clearly inconsistent with objective content of the conversations between the AP and PW1 Tam (Exhibit P5)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_419" id="Ftn_419_1"><sup>[note: 419]</sup></a></span>. Simply put, had the AP’s version been true, PW1 Tam would not have made a police report with allegations of the AP cheating him of over a million dollars.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_o">(o)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards PW1 Tam’s evidence that he was cheated of SGD $1,426,100 by the AP, the defence has incorrectly conceived of the prosecution case as being solely or mainly based on Exhibit P7. On the contrary, the prosecution case is instead primarily based on the testimony of PW1 Tam, which is then corroborated by (1) the testimonies of his <em>eight</em> friends and family members, (2) Exhibit P5, corroborated by Exhibits P3 and P4, and of course (3) Exhibit P7, which in turn is corroborated by Exhibits P9 to P25<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_420" id="Ftn_420_1"><sup>[note: 420]</sup></a>. In any case, Exhibit P7 is undoubtedly corroborated and reliable<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_421" id="Ftn_421_1"><sup>[note: 421]</sup></a></span>. The defence attempt to reduce the prosecution case to turn on the reliability of Exhibit P7 is overly simplistic and erroneous. First, the defence claim that, except for the three transactions corresponding to Exhibits P10, P18 and P22, the remaining transactions in Exhibit P7 “did not have any records of supporting evidence”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_422" id="Ftn_422_1"><sup>[note: 422]</sup></a></span> is simply incorrect. PW1 Tam testified clearly that every transaction that constitutes the total of SGD $1,426,100 was given to the AP for the purpose of investment, and for those transactions where money originated by his family member or friend, there would be at least one witness who supported PW1 Tam’s testimony. Second, the defence claim that PW1 Tam was “not able to produce any evidence of the cash or cheque being handed to (the AP)”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_423" id="Ftn_423_1"><sup>[note: 423]</sup></a></span> is also inaccurate. PW1 Tam’s oral testimony <u>is</u> the evidence and the defence had failed to show why he ought not to be believed as I have found PW1 Tam to be a credible and truthful witness<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_424" id="Ftn_424_1"><sup>[note: 424]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_p">(p)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, it is incredible that the defence seems to simply dismiss the testimonial evidence that the prosecution has adduced, particularly in relation to PW1 Tam, in its submissions. Oral testimony constitutes direct evidence, and the trial judge can make a finding on the credibility of the witness based on, <em>inter alia</em>, the demeanour of the witness, the internal consistency (or lack thereof) in the content of the witness’s evidence and the external (or lack thereof) between the content of the witness’s evidence and extrinsic evidence (e.g. documentary evidence, other witness testimonies)<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_425" id="Ftn_425_1"><sup>[note: 425]</sup></a>. In this vein, the defence is even more incredible and downright hypocritical by suggesting that this Court should reject the internally consistent and externally corroborated testimonial evidence of PW1 Tam and other prosecution witnesses but prefer the irreconcilably inconsistent and wholly uncorroborated testimony of the AP whom I have found not to be a credible and truthful witness and rejected her evidence in their entirety.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_426" id="Ftn_426_1"><sup>[note: 426]</sup></a></span> For all the arguments made against Exhibit P7’s reliability, the defence has offered <em>nothing</em> by way of documentary evidence or witness testimony in support of the AP’s testimony.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_q">(q)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As PW1 Tam’s credibility emerged intact and substantiated while the AP’s credibility is basically non-existent and unfounded, I took the view that the prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that PW1 Tam’s evidence on the sum of money (i.e. SGD $1,426,100) should be preferred over the AP’s evidence (i.e. SGD $300,000) in its entirety.</a></p><a id="p1_19-p2_q"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_q"></a><a id=""> <b>CASE OF PW13 SOH’S FRIENDS AGAINST THE AP</b> </a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_19-p2_a_9">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence adduced at the trial showed that PW13 Soh’s friends were dishonestly induced by the AP to hand over monies amounting to SGD$734,000 to her. For PW13 Soh’s friends’ charges, the AP’s admission to inducement is more direct. In fact, taking the AP’s case at its highest that she had knowingly allowed PW13 Soh to use her as a cover story to deceive her friends into extending loans by claiming it was meant for the AP’s business with promise of returns, a fact she knew to be false, she had basically admitted at least to a charge of engaging in a conspiracy with PW13 Soh to cheat her friends. Nonetheless, the truth was that the AP was not merely an unwilling conspirator as she claimed, but rather the chief and sole manipulator. PW13 Soh, PW17 Marilyn, PW19 Lim and PW20 Tan had all testified that, but for the AP’s representations about her alleged ‘business’ or investment scheme, they would have not have handed over monies to her. The AP’s own evidence was that, <em>but for the representations stated at paragraph [9] above in relation to her alleged ‘business’</em>,<sup>PW13 Soh’s friends would not have handed over monies, whether to the AP or PW13 Soh<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></sup></a><a href="#Ftn_427" id="Ftn_427_1"><sup>[note: 427]</sup></a>. Notably, the AP reinforced the representations about her alleged ‘business’ as the inducement by eliminating other options, like the Nanning project<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_428" id="Ftn_428_1"><sup>[note: 428]</sup></a></span> and PW13 Soh’s personal reasons<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_429" id="Ftn_429_1"><sup>[note: 429]</sup></a></span>. Hence, even based on the AP’s own version, she had dishonestly induced PW13 Soh’s friends to hand over monies to her by using her alleged ‘business’ that promised returns or interest, although she claimed that PW13 Soh was behind it. Furthermore, the AP verified the sum of SGD $734,000 being the amount that PW13 Soh’s friends were dishonestly induced to hand over<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_430" id="Ftn_430_1"><sup>[note: 430]</sup></a></span>, as corroborated by Exhibits P34 to P38. This was consistent with the unchallenged testimony of PW13 Soh’s friends concerning the amounts involved, which in turn was corroborated by the objective records that showed the source of funds (Exhibits P26 to P29) and the evidence of inducement (Exhibits P46 and P47)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_431" id="Ftn_431_1"><sup>[note: 431]</sup></a></span>. The defence submissions were also silent on the amount of monies given<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_432" id="Ftn_432_1"><sup>[note: 432]</sup></a></span> and failed to assert any contrary amounts of money given by or received from each of PW13 Soh’s friends<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_433" id="Ftn_433_1"><sup>[note: 433]</sup></a></span>. The defence submissions made a bare and incorrect assertion that the “amount of monies which had been paid (by) Mdm Yen as instalment or interest on the monies invested has also not been calculated or taken into account” in the charges<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_434" id="Ftn_434_1"><sup>[note: 434]</sup></a></span> as based on the evidence adduced at the trial, PW13 Soh had clearly testified, as corroborated by her friends, that the one instalment that she paid was out of her own pocket precisely because the AP had failed to provide the returns as promised, leaving her out to dry. In fact, this argument appears to be a further implicit concession of the AP’s liability. Had the AP been innocent and made use of by PW13 Soh, the value in the charges would be irrelevant given that she was disputing her responsibility in its entirety. Consequently, there is no dispute that the deception by way of false representations had dishonestly induced PW13 Soh’s friends to hand over SGD $734,000 to the AP.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b_10">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of whether PW13 Soh was the mastermind or victim of the AP’s deception which in practical terms centred around who took the sum of SGD $734,000, I took the view that the prosecution case is clear that the AP had deceived PW13 Soh, who delivered or caused to be delivered to the AP, a total sum of SGD $734,000 which was contributed by PW13’s friends. The defence case is rather unclear. At trial, it was asserted quite simply that the AP was being made use of by PW13 Soh to cheat her friends<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_435" id="Ftn_435_1"><sup>[note: 435]</sup></a>. However, the case advanced by the defence submissions is unclear and inconsistent.

It would appear that the defence may have refrained from such a strongly worded submission given how unbelievable<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_437" id="Ftn_437_1"><sup>[note: 437]</sup></a></span> such an unsubstantiated and self-serving fabrication was<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_438" id="Ftn_438_1"><sup>[note: 438]</sup></a></span>. Nonetheless, even taking the AP’s case at its highest (i.e. that PW13 Soh had used the AP to deceive her friends into giving her monies), the defence submissions are highly confusing and contradictory, reflecting the internal inconsistencies of the AP’s version at trial<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_439" id="Ftn_439_1"><sup>[note: 439]</sup></a></span> as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_19-p2_b-p3_i_11">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the AP’s presence at the respective transactions involving PW13 Soh’s friends, the defence initially cited with approval the AP’s evidence that she only “received payment from two of (PW13 Soh’s) friends”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_440" id="Ftn_440_1"><sup>[note: 440]</sup></a>, whereas it later stated that “it is not disputed that the AP was present when the monies were handed”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_441" id="Ftn_441_1"><sup>[note: 441]</sup></a></span>. This mirrors the inconsistency between the AP’s statements, CFD and trial testimony, which reflects the AP’s intention to distance herself from the transactions despite her most contemporaneous admission in her first statement (Exhibit D6) that she was present for all transactions and the objective corroboration of this fact by virtue of her signing of all the agreement documents (Exhibits P34 to P38).</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_19-p2_b-p3_ii_12">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the role of the AP vis-à-vis PW13 Soh, the AP’s version at trial was that she was used by PW13 Soh as a middleman to deceive her friends to hand over monies for her personal expenses<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_442" id="Ftn_442_1"><sup>[note: 442]</sup></a>.

However, it also appeared to concede to the prosecution case by submitting that PW13 Soh was in fact being used by the AP as a “proxy”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_444" id="Ftn_444_1"><sup>[note: 444]</sup></a></span>, which reflected how the AP’s deception was applied not just on PW13 Soh’s friends, but on her as well.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c_13">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence case on PW13 Soh’s friends’ charges appeared to hinge on two main aspects which again seek to rely on abstract logic to avoid confronting the mountain of incriminating evidence against the AP. First, the mere fact of significant involvement of PW13 Soh in the respective transactions involving her friends. Second, the mere fact that PW13 Soh’s friends were acquainted with her, and did not know the AP (e.g. the AP did not have their numbers or vice versa, the AP did not talk to them). The emphasis in the defence cross-examination of PW13 Soh and her friends, carried over into the defence submissions, was that PW13 Soh appeared to be at the heart of the transactions (i.e. she proposed the investment to her friends, informed them about the details, arranged the meeting with them that was to be held at her house, and she signed the agreements as a proxy for some). Consequently, the implicit reasoning appeared to be that PW13 Soh therefore must have been the instigator or initiator, not the AP. However, this argument appeared to be overly simplistic and achieved nothing. PW13 Soh’s evidence was clear that her proposal and information of the investment with her friends was essentially in the <em>role of a messenger or intermediary</em> between herself and the AP, and this was corroborated by her friends’ evidence about their knowledge that the investment was with the AP, not PW13 Soh. In fact, highlighting PW13 Soh’s relationship with her friends that the AP lacked merely served to exemplify the reason why the AP needed PW13 Soh as a proxy to convince her friends by exploiting the trust they had in her. The fact that PW13 Soh took responsibility for the monies simply corroborated her version that she was a proxy. Had she been the mastermind making use of the AP, she would have left the AP to answer for the monies. In fact, if the AP’s version were true, PW13 Soh would never have made a police report to expose herself.</a></p><a id="p1_19-p2_c_13"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c_13"></a><a id="p1_19-p2_d_14">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the defence conceded that Exhibit P6 constituted an “offer” for investment made by the AP to PW13 Soh<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_445" id="Ftn_445_1"><sup>[note: 445]</sup></a>, which clearly showed that the AP had initiated the investment and used PW13 Soh as a proxy<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_446" id="Ftn_446_1"><sup>[note: 446]</sup></a></span>. This was further corroborated by Exhibit P47 to show that the AP was the mastermind, which was left unrebutted in the defence submissions. By contrast, the AP offered no evidence to substantiate her claims that PW13 Soh was indeed the mastermind besides speculative reasoning based on neutral facts. In any case, the argument is neither here nor there, as the AP’s involvement was just as much, if not more. She had signed all the agreement documents that she had prepared, and she was present at all the monetary transactions. Most importantly, all the witnesses (i.e. PW13 Soh and her friends) were mutually corroborative in their unequivocal testimony that the AP had kept all the money handed over, with some even remembering her counting the cash before keeping it. Corroborative evidence like Exhibit P53 was provided to substantiate these claims. By contrast, the AP offered no evidence to substantiate her claims that she was not present at some meetings or that she did not take the monies from PW13 Soh’s friends.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_e_15">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence advanced a bizarre argument in the submissions claiming that the agreement documents were “enforceable”, since the parties were “aware of what they were getting involved in”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_447" id="Ftn_447_1"><sup>[note: 447]</sup></a> or “knowing well what they were getting into”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_448" id="Ftn_448_1"><sup>[note: 448]</sup></a></span>. As the defence submissions had summarized, “the issue here is whether it is an enforceable contract or a case of cheating”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_449" id="Ftn_449_1"><sup>[note: 449]</sup></a></span> which appeared to be suggesting that the AP did not dishonestly induce PW13 Soh and her friends because they had agreed to a valid and enforceable contract. However, since the AP was the one who prepared the agreement documents, explained them to PW13 Soh and her friends, and subsequently signed on every single one of them as the party “in charge of project operation and sourcing of customers”, this ironically only serves to show that the AP had indeed dishonestly induced them to hand over the monies using seemingly valid and enforceable documents. However, in reality, the documents simply could not be enforceable as there was no agreement in “operation”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_450" id="Ftn_450_1"><sup>[note: 450]</sup></a></span> given that the underlying representations (i.e. ‘business’) were false. Moreover, by suggesting that PW13 Soh and her friends should be taken as having understood what the respective agreements, the defence betrayed the fact that it was indeed the AP and not PW13 Soh who was the mastermind. As the AP had no ‘business’ as claimed, it is therefore fundamentally inconsistent for the AP to assert at trial that Exhibits P34 to P38 were sham documents that PW13 Soh used to deceive her friends, but then to subsequently argue in submissions that the documents were valid and enforceable knowing that the alleged basis (i.e. the AP’s ‘business’) was merely a cover story. In other words, if the AP’s version that PW13 Soh was making use of the AP as a cover story were true, the AP would surely have disputed the validity or enforceability of the agreement documents, given that her identity was misused. Conversely, it would only make sense that, as the one making the representations and receiving the money, and having used PW13 Soh as a proxy, the AP now sought to rely on the agreement documents to hold the victims to a contractual bargain and supposedly foreclose their ability to claim deception. However, this argument is fallacious because the agreements were based on representations that were false, and therefore cheating is made out.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_f_16">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have found that PW13 was a credible and truthful witness<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_451" id="Ftn_451_1"><sup>[note: 451]</sup></a> whose evidence is bolstered by corroboration with (1) the oral testimonies of her three friends, which were in turn corroborated by Exhibits P26 to P29, P46 to P47, P53; (2) documentary evidence in the form of Exhibits P6 and P34 to P38, I accepted the prosecution submission that the monies were taken by the AP which is further corroborated by the circumstantial evidence of tracing to deposits in her casino accounts.

She is also contradicted by the extrinsic evidence. Exhibits P6 and P34 to P38 clearly showed that she offered the investment “project” and clearly signed as the party “in charge of project operation”. Exhibit P47 showed that she was the one who initiated “termination” of the investment with PW17 Marilyn. The oral testimonies of all PW13 Soh’s three friends contradicted her claims that PW13 Soh was the mastermind: instead, their evidence clearly showed that PW13 Soh was a proxy for the AP’s deception by passing on her false representations and unwittingly facilitating the dishonest inducement of her friends to hand over monies to the AP.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""> <b>CASINO RECORDS USED TO SHOW TRACING</b> </a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_19-p2_a_18">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP’s casino records were used by the prosecution to show tracing (i.e. Exhibits P39 to P42, P50 to P51). These exhibits showed that about 63% of the total amount in PW1 Tam’s charge (i.e. SGD $897,820 out of SGD $1,426,100) and about 75% of the total amount in PW13 Soh’s charges (SGD $548,000 out of SGD $734,000) were traceable to casino deposits<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_456" id="Ftn_456_1"><sup>[note: 456]</sup></a>.

The defence baseless and speculative assertions to try to discredit the incriminating evidence were pointless and rejected by this court for the following reasons, as submitted by the prosecution:</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_19-p2_a-p3_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence claims that the fact that the sums of money obtained by the AP from PW1 Tam and PW13 Soh’s friends could be traced into her casino accounts was “merely coincidence” and “the money could have been derived from other sources”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_459" id="Ftn_459_1"><sup>[note: 459]</sup></a>. This is wholly unsatisfactory. If it were indeed a coincidence, there must be other sources of funds to account for these deposits. Given the AP’s own admission of her lack of such funds, and the objective lack of any evidence to show otherwise, the allegation of a “coincidence” based solely on the <em>speculative</em> assertion of the <em>mere possibility</em> of other funds is clearly self-serving and unreliable.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_19-p2_a-p3_ii">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence seems to claim that the casino records are “not conclusive proof” given that the similarity in dates (and amounts) is “merely circumstantial”. The defence submission that the records are not conclusive proof because they constitute circumstantial evidence is legally incorrect. A trial judge can convict an accused person wholly on circumstantial evidence if the cumulative effect of all the evidence leads to the irresistible conclusion that an accused had committed the crime, <em>subject to any reasonably possible explanation.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></em></a><em><a href="#Ftn_460" id="Ftn_460_1"><sup>[note: 460]</sup></a></em> The casino records are corroborative evidence to substantiate the direct evidence of PW1 Tam and PW13 Soh which were corroborated by 53 exhibits and 18 other witnesses. However, the strength of the casino records as circumstantial evidence is undeniable given the significant traceable sums and the complete lack of any reasonably possible explanation proffered by the AP, much less any evidence offered in support. Consequently, the irresistible conclusion is that the AP had committed the cheating offences and provides compelling evidence that the AP had taken SGD $1,426,100 from PW1 Tam (as opposed to SGD $300,000 as she claimed), and had kept the sum of SGD $734,000 from PW13 Soh’s friends (as opposed to PW13 Soh keeping it as she claimed).</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_19-p2_a-p3_iii">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence suggested some prejudice to the AP by virtue of the casino records allegedly on being shown to her at trial, suggesting that there was “no way one can verify the contents”. It was also suggested that the originality of the records was not verified. This argument should be summarily rejected since it is untrue that the AP was not shown the records previously, as PW18 IO Sky had clearly testified that he had confronted her with the gameplay losses in Exhibit P49, which she had signed to acknowledge. Even if the AP did not have a chance to verify every single entry in the records, her gambling activity would be something clearly in her personal knowledge. Even more so, any alternative source of funds to account for the transactions would also be a matter of personal knowledge. Presumably, that was how the AP managed to offer a response that she was helping others to gamble, in addition to her own funds, in Exhibit P49. However, the fact that the AP provided absolutely no evidence or even the slightest bit of verifiable information shows that this was simply another of her fabrications. Ultimately, regardless of what happened before, the records were placed completely before the AP at trial and she was directly confronted with the tracing of the cheating proceeds into her casino accounts. If she had any evidence or witness to prove otherwise, she would have provided it at trial. Yet, despite being unequivocally asked for an explanation, she simply attributed it to a “coincidence”.</a></p><a id="p1_19-p2_a-p3_iii"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a-p3_iii"></a><a id="p1_19-p2_b_19">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, I agreed with the prosecution submission that the evidence provided by the casino records, while circumstantial in nature, is highly probative in further corroborating the victims’ credible testimonies on the disputed issues, and conclusively rebutting the AP’s versions as well as showing her to be a thoroughly disingenuous and unreliable witness who should not be believed at all.</a></p><a id="p1_19-p2_b_19"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">(XIII)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AMENDMENT OF THE CHARGE IN DAC 905203/2021</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19-p2_b_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 128 of the CPC empowers the court to alter a charge in substitution for the existing charge at any time before judgment is given, and the amended charge must be read to the AP to enter her plea and to state whether she is ready to be tried on this amended charge under section 129 of the CPC.

Hence, the only doubt raised by the AP in relation to the sum of SGD $95,000 from Lydia (which is the same as all the other sums of monies from PW13 Soh’s friends) is that it was PW13 Soh who sought and received these monies.

Moreover, the credibility of PW13 Soh’s evidence is starkly contrasted to the completely unreliability of the AP’s evidence, and hence PW13 Soh’s evidence should be preferred. The defence had made no attempt to save, or made arguments in support of, the AP’s credibility despite it being thoroughly damaged in cross-examination, which can only be taken as an implicit concession of her unbelievability.

After careful consideration and weighing of the merits of each party’s arguments made in their respective submissions, my findings of facts in relation to the 5 charges (including the above amended charge in DAC 905203/2021) preferred against the AP are as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_22-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP had clearly applied deception on the victims by making false representations about alleged investment schemes offering attractive returns to PW1 Tam, and PW13 Soh and her friends. The AP had made representations about an alleged currency exchange scheme involving PRC visitors/clients to induce them to hand over various sums of money to her for “investment”. In this regard, I rejected the defence case that the AP had never made such representations to PW1 Tam, PW13 Soh and her friends or otherwise asked them to invest with her.</a></p><a id="p1_22-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_22-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rejected the defence submission that the monies were extended for the purpose of investment with no deception involved as I found that PW1 Tam’s testimony about the estimated SGD$1.4 million that he handed over to the AP was corroborated by the comprehensive documentary record in Exhibit P7 of the sums of money that he and his family members and friends had handed to the AP for the purpose of investment. PW1 Tam had prepared this document by cross-referencing his personal contemporaneous records with objective bank records. In turn, Exhibit P7 was corroborated by PW1 Tam’s bank statement<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_465" id="Ftn_465_1"><sup>[note: 465]</sup></a>.and reproductions of cheques issued by him and his family members<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_466" id="Ftn_466_1"><sup>[note: 466]</sup></a></span>. Not only were the sums correctly recorded, PW1 Tam’s records of particulars like the cheque numbers, the dates, and the origins of the respective sums were accurate when compared with the objective records. Notably, he had prepared Exhibit P7 without reference to most of the reproductions of the cheques that were <em>subsequently</em> obtained from the respective banks, suggesting that PW1 Tam had in fact kept an accurate personal record. Consequently, this lends great credibility to Exhibit P7, which in turn confers reliability on the total sum of SGD$1,426,100 from Exhibit P7 that was extended to the AP for investment.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP had dishonestly induced PW1 Tam, PW13 Soh and her friends to deliver money totalling a sum of SGD$2,160,100 to her. The AP had used false representations to dishonestly induce PW1 Tam and PW13 Soh’s friends (through PW13 Soh) to deliver various sums of money amounting to a total of SGD$2,160,100 to her by way of cash and cheques, which they would not have done if the alleged investment schemes did not exist. I rejected the defence case that the AP had obtained a sum of at least SGD$300,000 from PW1 Tam pursuant to a loan agreement with 10% interest payable, and that PW13 Soh had dishonestly induced her friends to deliver the entire sum of SGD$734,000 to herself and not to the AP.</a></p><a id="p1_22-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_22-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP possessed a dishonest or fraudulent intention and kept the sums of money that were handed over to her in that the AP had intended to cause wrongful loss to PW1 Tam and PW13 Soh’s friends and wrongful gain to herself by spending the sum of SGD$2,160,100 on her personal expenses despite knowing that she was not legally entitled to do so, with at least some of it used to fund her gambling in the casinos. I rejected the defence case that the AP had received at least SGD$300,000 from PW1 Tam on three or four occasions, and she had returned the entire sum of money that she took from PW1 Tam <em>with 10% interest</em> (i.e. PW1 Tam had recouped his capital sum with profit), and that PW13 Soh had personally kept the entire sum of SGD$734,000 given by her friends and the AP was merely used as a cover story.</a></p><a id="p1_22-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_22-p2_e">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount that the AP cheated PW1 Tam of was SGD $1,426,100 as charged and not SGD $300,000 (with SGD $330,000 returned) as the AP had claimed.

The defence submissions effectively gave up on the AP’s credibility and consistency. On this point, the evidence of the casino records proves critical for both set of charges. For PW1 Tam’s charge, there was irrefutable evidence of deposits of SGD $897,820 into the AP’s casino accounts corresponding to the period of the charge (i.e. August 2016 to January 2017). For PW13 Soh’s friends’ charges, there was irrefutable evidence of deposits of SGD $548,000 into the AP’s casino accounts corresponding to the period of the charge (i.e. November 2019 to December 2019). The AP’s failure to provide any verifiable explanation or information for the source of funds, or in the case of PW1 Tam’s charge, any evidence in support of the sum of SGD $300,000 (and the alleged returns with interest) is the final nail in the coffin. Taken together, the evidence adduced at the trial proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the AP had cheated the victims collectively of SGD $2,160,100 in respect of the 5 charges preferred against the AP, including the above amended charge in DAC 905203/2021.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agreed with the prosecution that the AP is a con artist who has caused significant harm to the victims in the present case. She deceived them with false representations and thereby dishonestly induced them to hand over to her the total sum of SGD$2,160,100, which she enjoyed for her personal use and appeared to have squandered away in casinos.

These initial acts were designed precisely to induce PW1 Tam into believing in the alleged legitimacy of her false representations.

The AP sought to assure PW1 Tam’s concerns about her trustworthiness by citing her roots in Singapore (i.e. her daughter studying in Singapore, ownership of property in Singapore). She had even introduced her family from China to PW1 Tam to let him believe that she was a trustworthy person.</a></p><a id="p1_26-p2_b-p3_iii"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_26-p2_b-p3_iii"></a><a id="p1_26-p2_b-p3_iv">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP’s deception was sophisticated.

She exploited psychological tricks of scarcity and urgency (i.e. citing the presence of competitors and need to act quickly) to request frequent and immediate fund transfers from PW1 Tam in the form of untraceable cash transactions (i.e. by claiming that she needed to hand over SGD in cash and had no time to encash cheques or convert transfers into cash). In particular, the phone conversations presented clear evidence of the AP’s web of lies that were designed to exploit psychological biases (e.g. sunk cost fallacy, gaslighting) to manipulate PW1 Tam and maintain her deception.</a></p><a id="p1_26-p2_b-p3_iv"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_26-p2_b-p3_iv"></a><a id="p1_26-p2_b-p3_v">(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP also sustained and enhanced her deception for a significant period of about six months.

First, she claimed that PW1 Tam’s funds were frozen in China, which allowed her to cite her PRC nationality in claiming that she had connections to delay PW1 Tam’s requests for repayment. Second, at the same time, she invented further false representations of a shorter turnover period involving another unknown Malaysian individual to capitalize on PW1 Tam’s desperation to hand over more monies to try to make up for the outstanding balance.

The deliberate nature of this act was revealed by the AP’s convenient but rigid defence at trial that the amounts were untraceable. Second, the AP tried to give numerous excuses and invented falsehoods, especially during the phone conversations, to try to placate PW1 Tam to prevent him from discovering the deception.

She had manipulated real-life justifications to bolster the perceived reliability of her false representations about providing funds to PRC tourists (i.e. PRC’s capital controls) and reasons for delay of repayment (i.e. COVID-19 situation). She had invented a justification to avoid the banks to convince PW13 Soh that her friends should hand over the money in cash such that it was not traceable to her. Furthermore, she had furnished agreement documents from templates that she had generated to create a sense of legitimacy. In particular, she showed the sophistication of her deception by incorporating incentives like giving the first month’s returns as an immediate rebate to enhance the attractiveness of her false representations, and also crafting the alleged project cooperation agreements with terms that precluded inquiry into her use of the funds (i.e. by making them agree to be silent partners who just provided capital).</a></p><a id="p1_27-p2_a-p3_iv"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_27-p2_a-p3_iv"></a><a id="p1_27-p2_a-p3_v">(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP also sustained her deception for a significant period of at least two months. Apart from the mere duration of the deception, she further <em>enhanced</em> her deception by falsely offering higher returns to induce delivery of more funds. This was accompanied by <em>further false representations</em> about how she was allegedly sacrificing her share of profits by offering higher returns to them. Subsequently, the AP also took advantage of the developing COVID-19 situation to claim that the project was inoperable that made PW13 Soh and her friends believe that there was a delay, thus prolonging their ignorance of her deception.</a></p><a id="p1_27-p2_a-p3_v"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_a-p3_v"></a><a id="p1_27-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like PW1 Tam’s charge, there are no offender-specific mitigating factors in the AP’s favour.

The evidence showed that the AP had significant expenses with no source of funds or income to sustain them. No restitution was made.

The AP was motivated to commit the cheating offences against PW13 Soh, inter alia, to fund her profligate gambling. The objective evidence showed 75% of the total amount (S$548,000) being traceable to the proceeds of the AP’s deception of PW13 Soh and her friends. In other words, the majority of proceeds went into the AP’s personal gambling account that she personally squandered through casino gameplay.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_27-p2_c-p3_iii">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP’s attempt to evade detection constitute an aggravating factor<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_478" id="Ftn_478_1"><sup>[note: 478]</sup></a>. First, the AP had convinced PW13 Soh that they should not involve the banks such that the transactions were in cash to avoid traceability to her. Second, the AP tried to give numerous excuses and invented falsehoods related to the COVID-19 situation to try to prevent PW13 Soh and her friends from discovering the deception. Third, when the AP was investigated, she invented false accounts of PW13 Soh being the real culprit that obstructed investigations and incurred unnecessary difficulties and costs.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_27-p2_c-p3_iv">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP’s lack of remorse by her conduct of her trial is an aggravating factor<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_479" id="Ftn_479_1"><sup>[note: 479]</sup></a>. The AP had made vexatious allegations against PW13 Soh for being a brazen criminal, by exploiting her as a cover story to deceive her friends of monies for her own personal benefit, only to unfairly blame an allegedly innocent party. In fact, the AP was describing herself. The AP’s conduct at trial was truly reprehensible. She re-victimized PW13 Soh by accusing her of cheating her friends and keeping the money that the AP had in fact benefitted from and left PW13 Soh to answer for.

In most cases, the offenders falsified invoices to overstate business activity and portray a false image of the company’s health. In gist, the custodial sentences imposed on those cases are far lower than the sentence sought in the present case, even for cases that involve significant higher quantum. The higher sentence imposed in the present case is entirely appropriate and justifiable given that the category of precedents that relate to corporate fraud should be distinguished for several reasons as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_29"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29"></a><a id="p1_29-p2_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victims in the corporate fraud cases were financial institutions. This is clearly distinguishable from the private individuals who suffered losses in the present case. While the loss suffered in the corporate fraud cases may have been higher in quantum than the present case, the significance and impact of loss to the private individuals in the present case is much more severe and crushing. In fact, as the evidence showed, the victims are still struggling to recover from the losses caused by the AP’s offending.</a></p><a id="p1_29-p2_i"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_i"></a><a id="p1_29-p2_ii">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total net loss caused in the category of precedents that relate to corporate fraud do not even come close to cheated amounts of the charges in the present case<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_482" id="Ftn_482_1"><sup>[note: 482]</sup></a>.

Single offenders and multiple offenders should not generally be treated alike. Concurrent sentences for unrelated offences would not adequately serve, and in fact may undermine, the sentencing considerations that underlie the individual sentences comprising the aggregate term.

She had perpetrated a sophisticated and carefully premeditated scheme of deception to fleece her victims of S$2,160,100 out of pure greed and self-interest. She had no qualms about exploiting and abusing their trust to extract monies from them and their family and friends for her personal benefit, the majority of which she squandered at the casinos. Even after her deception was discovered, she displayed an utter lack of remorse in refusing to admit to her transgressions and instead re-victimized PW1 Tam and PW13 Soh with various outrageous allegations. Her baseless and ridiculous contestation of the charges wasted time and resources over 12 days of trial. The AP’s predisposition for criminality and clear disregard for the law is evidenced by her commission of the series of cheating offences over a course of four years. After deceiving PW1Tam over a six-month period in 2016-2017, the AP targeted PW13 Soh and her friends at the end of 2019, <em>despite being investigated for her deception of Tam at the time</em>. Furthermore, her adoption of similar sophisticated schemes against both victims exhibit her high degree of planning and premeditation in committing offences involving financial dishonesty out of greed. The AP’s undeniably cunning and devious personality, coupled with a reprehensible lack of remorse, necessitates a harsh sentence to deter her from perpetrating such deception on more victims.</a></p><a id="p1_31-p2_e"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_e"></a><a id="p1_31-p2_f">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, I ordered the sentences of 7 years, 3 years and 2 years which I have imposed respectively for the charges in DAC-928505-2020, DAC-905204-2021 and DAC-905205-2021 to run consecutively giving a global sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment to be imposed on the AP and backdated to date of remand on 21 Feb 2020.</a></p><a id="p1_31-p2_f"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">(XVI)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NO MERIT IN THE DEFENCE MITIGATION AND SENTENCING SUBMISSIONS</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31-p2_f"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see no merit in and rejected the defence mitigation and sentencing submissions for reasons as submitted by the prosecution as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_32"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_32-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence mitigation offers no independent mitigating factors that warrant a downward adjustment of the individual and global sentences and did not propose any alternative and specific individual or global sentencing position.</a></p><a id="p1_32-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_32-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence has provided no reasoning for its submissions for two sentences to run consecutively.

The defence mitigation and responses to the individual aggravating factors as identified by the prosecution were based on blatantly inaccurate facts and at some points, appears to rehash some of its arguments made in its closing submissions for trial. This is entirely misguided. As this Court has found the AP guilty and delivered its findings of fact which have been read to both parties and recorded in writing in the Claim Trial Minute Sheet<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_494" id="Ftn_494_1"><sup>[note: 494]</sup></a> (“Court’s findings”), both parties’ submissions on sentence must be bound by this Court’s findings. Where the defence relies on or suggests facts that are inconsistent with this Court’s findings, these submissions must be summarily rejected. I note that the prosecution has highlighted four different offender-specific aggravating factors for both PW1 Tam and PW13 Soh’s cases which are consistent with this Court’s findings and are effectively unchallenged by the defence. Any claims raised by the defence in their mitigation in addressing these factors are irrelevant and/or pointless – in fact, they often serve to further accentuate the very aggravating factors that the defence tries to dispute. The aforesaid four aggravating factors are as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_32-p2_h-p3_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP was personally enriched from her offences as she had benefitted fully to the tune of SGD$2,160,100. This is consistent with this Court’s findings and the defence provided no evidence at trial or in mitigation to suggest anything to the contrary. Accordingly, the defence has conceded this point. The attempt to rehash the AP’s false claim of a loan of SGD$300,000 and to cast doubt on PW1 Tam’s evidence of the sum of SGD$1,426,100 is pointless given this Court’s acceptance of the sum as reliable based on the credibility of Exhibit P7 and utter rejection of the AP’s evidence as “internally inconsistent and completely unbelievable” .</a></p><a id="p1_32-p2_h-p3_i"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_32-p2_h-p3_i"></a><a id="p1_32-p2_h-p3_ii">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP acted out of pure self-interest and greed, being motivated to commit the offences for her personal expenses, including to fund her profligate gambling . This is consistent with this Court’s findings and the defence provided no evidence at trial or in mitigation to suggest anything to the contrary. Accordingly, the defence has conceded this point. The defence only express response to this point on self-interest in its mitigation makes a completely bizarre claim that PW1 Tam was acting in self-interest instead, and not the AP. Not only is the fact that PW1 Tam was acting in self-interest does not absolve the AP in any way, it also merely reinforces the sheer extent of the AP’s deception in manipulating PW1 Tam to believe her enough to even take monies from his family and friends and pass the monies to the AP.</a></p><a id="p1_32-p2_h-p3_ii"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_32-p2_h-p3_ii"></a><a id="p1_32-p2_h-p3_iii">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP had attempted to evade detection by obtaining the funds in cash, giving numerous excuses and invented falsehoods even during investigations . This is consistent with this Court’s findings and the defence provided no evidence at trial or in mitigation to suggest anything to the contrary. Accordingly, the defence has conceded this point. The defence suggestion that the AP did not evade detection simply because she stayed physically close to PW1 Tam or had opportunities to confront her is wrong. As the recorded phone conversations (Exhibit P5) showed, PW1 Tam did chase the AP for answers, but it was her excuses and falsehoods that allowed her to evade detection. In fact, it is likely because she did not run away or completely cut off contact that contributed to PW1 Tam’s mistaken belief that there was still hope.</a></p><a id="p1_32-p2_h-p3_iii"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_32-p2_h-p3_iii"></a><a id="p1_32-p2_h-p3_iv">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP was unremorseful in her conduct of trial in making vexatious allegations against the witnesses, including the victims themselves. This is squarely in line with this Court’s findings. The defence has rightly not suggested anything to the contrary in their mitigation. Given that the AP’s defence essentially rests on re-victimizing PW1 Tam and PW13 Soh with her vexatious allegations, this Court’s rejection of the defence in its entirety alone is sufficient to establish this aggravating factor. To drive the final nail in the coffin, the defence reiteration of similar vexatious insinuations against PW1 Tam and PW13 Soh somehow being responsible for the AP’s offending in the defence mitigation despite this Court’s findings only serves to accentuate the AP’s lack of remorse and shamelessness.</a></p><a id="p1_32-p2_h-p3_iv"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_h-p3_iv"></a><a id="p1_32-p2_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence attempted challenges to the prosecution’s offence-specific aggravating factors were misguided. The AP was the sole perpetrator and beneficiary. The AP had conceived of the entire plan, executed it on her own and entirely enjoyed the benefits from her criminality. This is consistent with this Court’s findings and the defence has left this point undisputed at trial and in mitigation. Accordingly, this point remains unchallenged.</a></p><a id="p1_32-p2_i"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_i"></a><a id="p1_32-p2_j">(j)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP’s deception was planned and premeditated. She had planned and premeditated her deception of PW1 Tam and PW13 Soh by cultivating their trust as friends and expanded her reach by convincing them to obtain funds from friends and family members when they personally lacked funds. This is consistent with this Court’s findings in accepting PW1 Tam and PW13 Soh’s testimonies as credible and consistent, while rejecting the AP’s evidence in its entirety and rightly branding her a blatant liar. The defence has left this point undisputed in mitigation. Accordingly, this point remains unchallenged.</a></p><a id="p1_32-p2_j"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_j"></a><a id="p1_32-p2_k">(k)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Court had found that the AP had exploited and abused the trust of PW1 Tam and PW13 Soh and manipulated them using their friendship and goodwill. In PW13 Soh’s case, the AP had exploited PW13 Soh by leaving her to deal with the fallout with her friends as the proxy. The defence responses in PW1 Tam’s case on this point are clearly misguided. The defence assertion that there was “interest” offered as a saving grace is bizarre, because it was simply part of the AP’s false representations used to deceive PW1 Tam. Furthermore, any actual interest paid out was merely part of the deception and further adds to the exploitation and abuse of the trust. The defence reliance on the evidence of repayment by some of the witnesses in PW1 Tam’s case is misguided – the repayment was not made by PW1 Tam, but by his sisters on his behalf after the deception was discovered. Moreover, even if some of the victims were repaid in full, this does not in any way detract from the AP’s exploitation and abuse of PW1 Tam’s trust.</a></p><a id="p1_32-p2_k"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_k"></a><a id="p1_32-p2_l">(l)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence claim that there was no exploitation and abuse of PW1 Tam’s trust because he was “fully aware (of) the stakes involved in the investment (and) the AP had not lied to him (about) the purposes of the money and they were for PRC nationals to use at the casinos” . This submission is utterly bizarre. By asserting PW1 Tam’s full awareness of the stakes involved in the fictitious investment, the defence is simply reinforcing the depth of the AP’s deception. Furthermore, this Court has unequivocally found that the representations about investment involving PRC nationals were false and the AP had in fact personally gambled a significant portion of PW1 Tam’s monies away in the casino. Hence, the defence mitigation is accurate that the AP did not lie to PW1 Tam to the shameless extent that her reference to the PRC national(s) using PW1 Tam’s monies in the casino was in fact herself.</a></p><a id="p1_32-p2_l"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_l"></a><a id="p1_32-p2_m">(m)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence has simply made a baseless suggestion of doubt on the presence of exploitation and abuse of trust which has been rejected by this Court in its entirety in PW13’s case. Furthermore, the defence repetition of PW13 Soh’s importance in the whole scheme in getting her friends on board simply reinforced the fact that the AP had exploited and abused PW13 Soh’s trust, that led her rope in her friends who in turn “trusted” her.</a></p><a id="p1_32-p2_m"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_m"></a><a id="p1_32-p2_n">(n)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP had employed a sophisticated criminal scheme. As found by this Court, the prosecution had provided extensive reasoning from the trial evidence to show that the AP’s offending was sophisticated both against PW1 Tam (DAC-925802-2020) and PW13 Soh and her friends (DAC-905203-2021 to DAC-905206-2021). The sophistication in the AP’s deception was clear from PW1 Tam and PW13 Soh’s testimonies and the documentary exhibits admitted at trial. Crucially, PW1 Tam and PW13 Soh’s testimonies are reliable because this Court had found their “credibility and consistency to be effectively intact”, and that their testimonies “provided corroboration” to the prosecution exhibits. In both cases, as found by this Court, the evidence at trial showed that the AP had manipulated real-life justifications to create a veneer of reliability for her false representations. In PW1 Tam’s case, she had further utilized psychological tricks and exploited psychological biases for the purpose of manipulation. In PW13 Soh’s case, the AP had used documentation to create a façade of legitimacy, incorporated incentives as baits and crafted a situation that prevented discovery of her deception.</a></p><a id="p1_32-p2_n"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_n"></a><a id="p1_32-p2_o">(o)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence sweeping conclusion that the AP’s deception was “not a sophisticated criminal scheme” because she did not cheat an institutional entity or use complex technological means is erroneous.

First, the defence summary that “the sophistication claimed by the prosecution is based on the loan being extended to China Nationals (for) purposes of gambling” completely ignores this Court’s findings that the AP’s deception was sophisticated<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_498" id="Ftn_498_1"><sup>[note: 498]</sup></a>. Second, the fact that the AP had deceived a “friend” (PW1 Tam) is not mutually exclusive from the AP’s application of a sophisticated criminal scheme. In fact, as the prosecution had submitted, this in fact allowed the AP to exploit the friendship. Third, the defence mention of the absence of computers is bizarre. The sophistication in the present case has nothing to do with technology, online application for monies, a bank or financial institution or a government agency. As clearly submitted by the prosecution and found by this Court, it involved the manipulation of reality, creation of false legitimacy and exploitation of psychological tricks and biases to create a complex web of lies.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_q">(q)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP had sustained and enhanced her deception for about six months in PW1 Tam’s case and at least two months in PW13 Soh’s case. Not only was the duration considerable, she had enhanced her deception by making further false representations to induce the delivery of more funds. This is consistent with this Court’s findings in accepting PW1 Tam and PW13 Soh’s evidence.

Besides the AP rehashing her rejected version of repaid loans of SGD$300,000 with interest, the defence harped on the evidence by PW1 Tam’s family members that they understood PW1 Tam to be business partners with the AP. The answer is simple – while PW1 Tam was never in fact business partners with the AP, she had deceived him into believing this, which was the understanding that he conveyed to his family members and/or friends<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_500" id="Ftn_500_1"><sup>[note: 500]</sup></a>.

The AP made no restitution, was uncooperative with authorities throughout investigations and showed no remorse. This was unchallenged by the defence in their mitigation. The defence has at best alluded to two potential offender-specific mitigating factors in highlighting the AP’s circumstances in the defence introduction to the mitigation, but both do not carry any mitigatory weight. First, the suggestion of her unexceptional personal circumstances, particularly the daughter who is still studying, does not warrant any mitigatory weight<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_502" id="Ftn_502_1"><sup>[note: 502]</sup></a></span>.

Notably, the defence has even cited two of the cases relied upon by the prosecution (namely, <em>Kea Meng Cheng</em> and <em>Stefanovic Nenad</em>) without any dispute with the prosecution’s calibration of sentences from these cases, or offering any alternative reasoning.

In any case, the aforesaid unreported cases are likely to be inappropriate comparators to the present case for the purpose of calibrating the appropriate sentence. As the defence rightly pointed out in its mitigation, despite both cases involving cheating offences, there are significant differences in the circumstances of those unreported cases with the present case, like the use of technology and the different nature of the victim (institutional entity vs. individual), just to name two.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">(XVII)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONCLUSION ON SENTENCE</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all the above reasons, I sentenced the AP to 7 years, 3 years and 2 years for the charges in DAC-928505-2020, DAC-905204-2021 and DAC-905205-2021 respectively and ordered them to run consecutively with a global sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment which, in my view, was not manifestly excessive or inadequate, but wholly appropriate and commensurate with the nature and extent of the AP’s culpability, and was a sufficient deterrent sentence tempered with proportionality without the effect of a crushing sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_33"> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"></a><p class="Footnote"><a id="p1_33"><sup></sup></a><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a>The total amount involved in PW13’s friends’ 4 charges was SGD 734,000 and the total sum involved in all 5 charges was SGD 2,160,100.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup><em>Gunasegaran s/o Pavadaisamy v PP <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1997] 2 SLR(R) 0946.xml')">[1997] 2 SLR(R) 946</a> (“Gunasegaran”) at [42] to [45].</em></p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>The ordinary meaning of the word deceiving is causing another to believe which is not true.

As submitted in paragraphs [75] of the prosecution closing submissions and paragraph [63] of the prosecution reply submissions, the [AP] does not dispute this sum.

For avoidance of doubt, this SGD $95,000 sum did not originate from PW13 Soh, but from her friend Lydia, who did not testify at trial because she was in Canada (NEs, Day 12, Page 16 Line 29)– this is undisputed by the [AP] (NEs, Day 12 Page 70 Lines 1-3, Day 18 Page 3 Lines 23-24, Page 29 Lines 29-30).

This sum of SGD $100,000 is the subject of the stood-down charge DAC-900840-2021, and is excluded from the sum of SGD $734,000….….the Prosecution’s position, which is consistent with both PW13 Soh and the [AP]’s evidence at trial, is that the SGD $95,000 was the subject of the charge DAC-905203-2021, and corroborated by Exhibit P34 that was signed by PW13 Soh on behalf of her friend, Lydia.

His intention in committing the offences was not to defraud OCBC Bank of the sum in each transaction. He had carried out the fraud in the hope that it would tide him over a tight cash flow situation. He had every intention to repay OCBC Bank when, as he had hoped, the company’s fortunes turned around. Unfortunately it did not, and he had to plug more and more leaks to his collapsing wall of debt as the company succumbed to the financial turmoil swirling around him. </em><b><em>His motivation was to stave off what he thought was temporary insolvency so that his company could survive and his employees could remain in their jobs. I stress that to the extent that the court below considered that this factor does not relieve him of his culpability, it is absolutely correct. However this situation is vastly different from one where the perpetrator commits an offence for direct financial gain or to repay gambling debts. And it is to that category of cases that we must turn to compare against the sentence in the present case.</em></b><b>”</b> (emphasis added)</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_484_1" id="Ftn_484">[note: 484]</a></sup>See <em>Wong Kai Chuen Philip v PP [1990] 2 SLR (R) 361 at [18] , PP v Fernando Payagala Waduga Malitha Mumar <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/52453-M.xml')">[2007] SGHC 23</a> (“Fernando Payagala”) at [47]).</em></p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_485_1" id="Ftn_485">[note: 485]</a></sup>See <em>Fernando Payagala at [74].</em></p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_486_1" id="Ftn_486">[note: 486]</a></sup>See <em>PP v Raveen Balakrishnan <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22604-SSP.xml')">[2018] 5 SLR 799</a></em>.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_487_1" id="Ftn_487">[note: 487]</a></sup>See <em>Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16232-SSP-M.xml')">[2014] 2 SLR 998</a> (“Shouffee”) at [41].</em></p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_488_1" id="Ftn_488">[note: 488]</a></sup>See <em>Shouffee at [47].</em></p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_489_1" id="Ftn_489">[note: 489]</a></sup>See <em>Shouffee at [56].</em></p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_490_1" id="Ftn_490">[note: 490]</a></sup>See <em>Shouffee at [53].</em></p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_491_1" id="Ftn_491">[note: 491]</a></sup>Reproduced in ANNEX A of the Prosecution’s Reply to Defence Mitigation Plea dated 7 February 2023.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_492_1" id="Ftn_492">[note: 492]</a></sup>See paragraph 31(d)(ii) of this GD above.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_493_1" id="Ftn_493">[note: 493]</a></sup>See paragraphs 26(b) and 26(d) and paragraphs 27(a) and 27(c) of this GD above.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_494_1" id="Ftn_494">[note: 494]</a></sup>Reproduced in ANNEX A of the Prosecution’s Reply to Defence Mitigation Plea dated 7 February 2023.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_495_1" id="Ftn_495">[note: 495]</a></sup>See the dictionary definitions of sophistication: “the quality in a machine or system of being clever and complicated in the way that it works or is presented” (Oxford dictionary); “a way of thinking, system or machine that is complicated or made with great skill” (Cambridge dictionary).</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_496_1" id="Ftn_496">[note: 496]</a></sup>See unreported cases of <em>PP v Ng Cheng Kwee &amp; PP v Lee Lai Leng</em> cited by the defence.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_497_1" id="Ftn_497">[note: 497]</a></sup>The only mention of sophistication in PW13 Soh’s case was a bare assertion that “there is little room to claim that there was sophistication involved in the scheme of things” in paragraph [20] of the defence mitigation.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_498_1" id="Ftn_498">[note: 498]</a></sup>See paragraphs 26(b)(iv) and 31(e) of this GD above.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_499_1" id="Ftn_499">[note: 499]</a></sup>Paragraphs [8], [11] and [12] of the defence mitigation (suggestion that PW1 Tam’s evidence of the long-term and short-term loans do not make sense), and paragraphs [21] to [22] (suggestion that PW13 Soh was somehow responsible for the payments to her friends or inducement of her friends) of the defence mitigation,</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_500_1" id="Ftn_500">[note: 500]</a></sup>See paragraph under “PW1 TAM’S CASE AGAINST THE AP” of this GD above.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_501_1" id="Ftn_501">[note: 501]</a></sup>See paragraphs 26(c) and 27(b) of this GD above.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_502_1" id="Ftn_502">[note: 502]</a></sup>See <em>Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1993] 2 SLR(R) 0406.xml')">[1993] 2 SLR(R) 406</a> at [11] to [12].</em></p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_503_1" id="Ftn_503">[note: 503]</a></sup>See <em>Edwin s/o Suse Nathan v PP <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 1139.xml')">[2013] 4 SLR 1139</a> at [24].</em></p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_504_1" id="Ftn_504">[note: 504]</a></sup>See <em>Ong Chee Eng v PP <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 3 SLR 0776.xml')">[2012] 3 SLR 776</a> at [33]</em>, citing <em>Luong Thi Trang Hoang Kathleen v PP <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 1 SLR 0707.xml')">[2010] 1 SLR 707</a> at [21].</em></p></div></content></html>
