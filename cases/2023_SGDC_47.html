He got to know one “Ah Siao” over Telegram in November 2019. “Ah Siao” became the Accused’s regular supplier of ketamine and “ecstasy” from then on. Over time, the Accused also purchased “Erimin-5” and “ice”, which are street names for nimetazepam and methamphetamine respectively, from “Ah Siao”.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused initially purchased small amounts of drugs from “Ah Siao” about once every fortnight, but his drug orders increased in quantity and frequency over time. In June 2020, “Ah Siao” offered the Accused a $300 discount per drug order in exchange for collecting and safekeeping drugs on his behalf. The Accused agreed as he wanted to purchase drugs at a discount. From June 2020 until the Accused’s first arrest on 2 November 2020, the Accused would collect “ice”, “ecstasy” or ketamine from various locations on “Ah Siao”’s instructions. The Accused would safekeep the drugs and await “Ah Siao”’s instructions. When “Ah Siao” asked for the drugs, the Accused would place them in a discreet location, knowing that they would be collected by “Ah Siao”’s other runners for eventual sale or distribution. The Accused would inform “Ah Siao” of where he had left the drugs.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between June 2020 and end September 2020, “Ah Siao” gave the Accused a $300 discount per drug order whenever the Accused collected drugs on his behalf. During this period, the Accused typically collected about 50g to 100g of “ice”, 50 to 100 tablets of “ecstasy” or 20g to 30g of ketamine. From end September 2020 onwards, “Ah Siao” would ask the Accused to collect drugs even when the Accused had not ordered any drugs. The Accused nevertheless agreed. Between end September 2020 and 2 November 2020, the Accused collected about 500g to 1kg of “ice”, 100 to 200 tablets of “ecstasy” or 50g of ketamine on “Ah Siao”’s behalf each time. “Ah Siao” paid the Accused $500 for each collection during this period.</a></p><a id="p1_9"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Facts Pertaining to DAC 904885/2021 – Trafficking in Methamphetamine</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the night of 31 October 2020, the Accused agreed to collect 1kg of “ice” on “Ah Siao”’s behalf at Northstar @ AMK, located at 7030 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5, Singapore (“Northstar”). The Accused knew that “ice” was methamphetamine. He arrived at Northstar at about 11.20pm. On “Ah Siao”’s instructions, the Accused collected a red plastic bag containing a white plastic package near a rubbish bin on the ninth floor. The Accused then headed home to Block 484 Segar Road, #XXX, Singapore.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1 November 2020, at about 12.50am, the Accused opened the white plastic package that he had collected. It contained a large transparent plastic packet (“the Large Packet”), which in turn contained some crystalline substance. The Accused knew that the crystalline substance was “ice”. On “Ah Siao”’s instructions, the Accused repacked the “ice” in the Large Packet into eight smaller packets as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_11"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_11-p2_a">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four packets each containing 125g of “ice”;</a></p><a id="p1_11-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_11-p2_b">b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two packets each containing 150g of “ice”;</a></p><a id="p1_11-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_11-p2_c">c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One packet containing 100g of “ice”; and</a></p><a id="p1_11-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_11-p2_d">d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One packet containing 88g of “ice”.</a></p><a id="p1_11-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused informed “Ah Siao” at about 2.11am that there was a shortfall of about 14g of “ice”. Later that day, the Accused repacked the “ice” further and placed five of the eight smaller packets of “ice” at a different location each. “Ah Siao” paid the Accused $600 for collecting the “ice” in the Large Packet and depositing the five smaller packets of “ice” at various locations.</a></p><a id="p1_12"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 2 November 2020, at about 5.30pm, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) arrested the Accused near Block 449, Clementi Avenue 3, Singapore for drug offences. They then escorted the Accused to his home. At about 5.55pm, CNB officers searched the Accused and his bedroom. Among other items in the Accused’s bedroom, CNB officers recovered a white plastic package (later marked exhibit “A1”) containing three packets of crystalline substance (later marked exhibit “A1A” collectively). The mandatory death penalty notice was served on the Accused at about 6.55pm.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon analysis by the Illicit Drugs Laboratory of the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”), the exhibit marked “A1A” was found to be three packets containing not less than 315.1g of crystalline substance, which was analysed and found to contain not less than 214.2g of methamphetamine. Methamphetamine is a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA. At all material times, the Accused knew that he possessed exhibits “A1” and “A1A”. Exhibit “A1” was the white plastic package that he had collected at Northstar on 31 October 2020 while exhibit “A1A” contained the leftover “ice” from the Large Packet. The Accused also knew that exhibit “A1A” contained “ice”.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused was in possession of exhibit “A1A” for the purpose of trafficking.

As the Accused was suspected to have committed drug offences, he was asked to provide two bottles of his urine. The urine samples were subsequently sent to the HSA on 22 July 2021 for analysis. Upon analysis, the HSA issued two certificates under section 16 of the MDA stating that the two urine samples were analysed and found to contain norketamine.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norketamine is a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA.

He would place some ketamine in a line on a flat surface and snort the ketamine either directly or with a straw. He snorted about 1g of ketamine every two days, or about 3g to 5g of ketamine per week.

He responded by punching Mr Ong’s face repeatedly, knowing himself to be likely to cause grievous hurt. Although Mr Ong tried to shove and punch the Accused in return, he mostly failed to land any blows on the Accused. At one point, Mr Ong grabbed the Accused to stop the Accused from punching him further.

Upon hearing this, the Accused punched Mr Ong’s face and chest repeatedly. Mr Ong did not retaliate. When the Accused eventually calmed down, he told Mr Ong that he could not afford to encounter the police. He also offered to pay Mr Ong not to pursue the matter.

Given the net weight of methamphetamine trafficked at 214.2 grams, the prescribed punishment was a minimum term of imprisonment of 20 years and a maximum imprisonment term of 30 years or imprisonment for life. The offence also carried mandatory caning of 15 strokes. It was just 35.8 grams short of 250 grams – the weight of methamphetamine if trafficked in, which would have been punishable by death. As observed by the High Court in the case of <em>Vasentha d/o Joseph</em> v <em>Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18022-SSP.xml')">[2015] 5 SLR 122</a> at [19], the quantity of drugs trafficked in, served as a reliable indicator of the seriousness of the offence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50">50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Correspondingly, there was a high degree of harm caused by the Accused’s act of trafficking. As stated in the same passage in <em>Vasentha</em>, the net weight of drugs trafficked had a direct correlation with the degree of harm caused to society<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51">51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused’s level of culpability was high. Net weight of drugs aside, he played a significant role in the distribution of drugs. By the time of his arrest, the Accused was already deep in the business of trafficking. He was arrested on 2 November 2020 but the facts revealed that from June 2020, he had been an active participant in “Ah Siao”’s trafficking network - collecting “ice”, “ecstasy” or ketamine from various locations on “Ah Siao”’s instructions, safekeeping them before placing them in discreet locations for collection by other runners for sale or distribution<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a>.

At the time of his arrest, the Accused was even collecting large amounts of “ice” and re-packing them into smaller packets of various amounts for distribution<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> in his home; he was not merely involved in its distribution.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52">52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seriousness of the offence of drug trafficking was an important consideration in determining if rehabilitation remained the dominant sentencing consideration for the Accused. On this note, Defence Counsel was right in pointing out that RTC had been imposed in cases where youthful offenders had committed very serious offences such as rape<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a>, robbery<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> and even drug trafficking<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>. I was not oblivious to that fact. However, the seriousness of the offence was not the only factor to be considered; it was but one aspect of a total and holistic consideration of all circumstances of the case in order to arrive at a final determination of what the dominant sentencing consideration ought to be in each particular case.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Accused’s Recalcitrance</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53">53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Accused had stopped offending upon his first arrest on 2 November 2020 and after being charged in court, the case might have taken on a different complexion.</a></p><a id="p1_53"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a><a id="p1_54">54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been duly recognised that young offenders should be given a second chance because of their “<em>youthful folly and inexperience</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a>.

While he was on the run, he continued to possess illegal drugs<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> and committed further offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57">57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As pointed out by the Prosecution<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a>, the Accused’s offending spanned more than 2.5 years, on various occasions, from 21 September 2019<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> to 1 April 2022<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>. He had to be arrested on two further occasions before he was finally remanded until the date of sentence. In my mind, youthful folly, inexperience and/or the failure on the part of a young offender to realise the full consequences of his or her actions, even if accepted in respect of the Accused’s initial offending, could not excuse his conduct in the period of time where he persisted in committing multiple offences whilst court proceedings were on-going.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58">58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same vein, even if this court could accept that the Accused was manipulated by “Ah Sio” and/or “Ah Siao”’s threats to kill himself played on the Accused’s mind and led to him continuing to work for “Ah Sio” even though he wanted to stop doing so before he was caught<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a>, the fact of that would only have moderated Accused’s culpability in respect of the trafficking offence but would again, be of little value in explaining Accused’s lingering association with drugs after the first arrest. In any case, other than the Accused’s assertion based on a few messages between “Ah Sio “and the Accused, there was no evidence before the court that the Accused had been so manipulated by “Ah Sio” that he had no choice but to commit the offence of drug trafficking.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Accused’s Mental Condition</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59">59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature and gravity of Accused's mental condition was over-stated by Defence Counsel. The first IMH report dated 30 November 2020 did speak of the Accused having Substance Use Disorder (SUD), and a history of Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD) which according to Dr Koh Wun Wu Kenneth “<em>adversely affected his judgment when he first started dealing in drugs for his supplier as he had catastrophic and blinkered cognitive distortions</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a> However, in a subsequent report dated 3 November 2022 in response to the queries of the Investigation Officer, Dr Wu clarified that the Accused’s SUD and PDD “<em>did not affect or control the Accused’s offending impulses, his knowledge of the legal rightness or wrongness of his actions and his awareness of the moral rightness of wrongness of his actions when he committed the drug trafficking offence</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60">60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, whilst the Accused may have had some challenges in terms of his mental health, the assessment of his condition by Dr Wu put the Accused’s mental state in perspective. Despite the disorders, it was clear that the Accused knew right and wrong, and the right from wrong of his actions at the material time. Further as of 2 November 2020, the Accused was already recovering from his PDD and that his symptoms if any, were minimal<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Overall Assessment </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61">61&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused's capacity for rehabilitation was not so demonstrably high that it would not be overshadowed by the need for deterrence. On the evidence before me, there was nothing exceptional about the surrounding circumstances of this case or the degree of remorse shown by the Accused, or the level of familial support that would be available to the Accused strong as it may be, so as to justify maintaining an overriding focus on the Accused’s rehabilitation despite the serious nature of the offences he had committed and the circumstances of the case. As evident from the RT report, the Accused presented attitudes supportive of criminal behaviour. His persistent offending also revealed his disregard for consequences. Despite a pledge of support from his family, there was a consistent account by both the Accused and his mother that his relationship with his family was distant. Since July 2021, the Accused had stayed away from his family even though he still cared for his mother<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62">62&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the reasons elaborated above, I found that deterrence had come to the fore as the dominant sentencing consideration in this case; not rehabilitation.
