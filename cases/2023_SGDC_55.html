He had applied for a non-user status for the motorcycle on 31 May 2021. The vehicle was under lay-up status from 1 June 2021 to 30 September 2021. The place of garage was declared as at Block 59 Marine Terrace Singapore 440059. There was no valid vehicle licence (road tax) in force during the lay-up period.</a></p><a id="p1_5"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 23 June 2021 at about 1.15pm, along Paya Lebar Road near lamp post no.69, a Senior Enforcement Officer from Enforcement Division, Land Transport Authority stopped the motorcycle for checks. Upon checking, it was discovered that the accused had used a non-user motorcycle without a vehicle licence (road tax) and insurance coverage in force. In view of the motorcycle’s lay-up status, there was no valid vehicle licence (road tax) in force when the accused used the motorcycle on 23 June 2021.</a></p><a id="p1_6"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The insurance policy for the motorcycle under FWD Singapore Pte Ltd was valid for the period from 30 May 2021 to 30 May 2022. The insurance company had confirmed that the policy was invalid on 23 June 2021 as the motorcycle was used while under a non-user status. Hence, there was no policy of insurance or security with respect to third-party risks that had complied with the requirements of the MVA when the defendant used the motorcycle 23 June 2021.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentencing</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Prescribed Penalties</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prescribed penalty for an offence under s 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (“MVA”) is fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or to both. S 3(3) of the MVA provides that a person convicted of an offence under this section shall be disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence under the RTA for a period of 12 months from the date of the conviction or to a longer period of disqualification unless there are special reasons not to make the order.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Antecedents</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused was untraced.</a></p><a id="p1_9"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution sought a fine of $600 as well as the mandatory 12 months’ disqualification order for all classes of vehicles for the charge under s 3(1) of the MVA.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigation</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his oral plea in mitigation, the accused claimed that during his appeal his Investigation Officer told him that his licence would not be disqualified.</a></p><a id="p1_11"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision on sentence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The usual sentence for a first offender for an offence under s 3(1) of the MVA is a fine ranging from $600 to $800 and the mandatory disqualification for a period of 12 months from the date of the conviction or to a longer period of disqualification unless there are special reasons not to make the order.</a></p><a id="p1_12"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of “special reasons” was considered by the High Court in the cases of <em>Muhammad Faizal bin Rahim v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/13294-SSP-M.xml')">[2012] 1 SLR 116</a> and <em>Prathib s/o M Balan v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21700-SSP.xml')">[2018] 3 SLR 1066</a>. The High Court held that the phrase “special reasons” has a narrow meaning. Only reasons connected to the offence and not reasons related to the offender are to be considered. The fact that an offender requires the driving licence to earn a living is not considered as a special reason.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, no special reasons relating to the offence were provided by the accused. The accused merely stated that his Investigation Officer told him during his appeal that his licence would not be disqualified. Accordingly, I found that there were no special reasons before me not to impose the mandatory disqualification order pursuant to s 3(3) of the MVA.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, as the accused had pleaded guilty to the under s 3(1) of the MVA at the first mention and the fine proposed by the Prosecution was within the normal tariff, I imposed a fine $600 in default one day’s imprisonment and disqualified him from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 12 months from the date of his conviction.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a></div></content></html>
