The said cheque was dishonoured upon presentation. On 20 September 2019, a director of Aspario, one Huang Junjie (also known as “Jason”), transferred $1,000 to the Plaintiff’s representative’s bank account.

They conduct negotiations and enter contracts on behalf of their principals, thereby relieving the principals of the time, effort and expertise required to undertake the transactions by themselves. In law, agency has therefore been described as a relationship which exists where one person has the authority or capacity to create legal relations between his principal and a third party (<em>LC Fowler &amp; Sons Ltd v St Stephen’s College Board of Governors</em> [1991] 3 NZLR 304 at 306).</a></p><a id="p1_27"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agency relationship is established by consent (<em>Garnac Grain Co Inc v HMF Faure and Fairclough Ltd</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/English/65489-E-M.xml')">[1968] AC 1130</a> at 1137). Ordinarily, the scope of contracts that the agent is entitled to transact on behalf of the principal would have been consented to by the principal.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agents, however, sometimes go rogue. They commit their principals to contracts for which they are not authorised. Agents can do so for various reasons, sometimes to advance their own interest, and at other times out of sheer negligence. By the time the principal discovers the contract, the contract may well have been finalised, and sometimes, executed. When the third party (whom I will refer to for convenience as the “contractor”) seeks to enforce the contract against the principal, it is not surprising to find the principal attempt to disavow the actions of the agent, refusing to be bound by a contract for which the agent had no authority to endorse on its behalf.</a></p><a id="p1_29"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As between the contractor and the principal, the court is tasked to decide which of the two seemingly innocent parties should suffer the wrongdoing of the agent. The doctrine of apparent authority is often invoked to resolve such disputes.</a></p><a id="p1_30"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparent authority is the authority of the agent as it “appears” to others (<em>Hely-Hutchinson v Brayhead Ltd and another</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/English/9129-E-M.xml')">[1967] 3 WLR 1408</a> (“<em>Hely-Hutchinson</em>”) at 1416). Such appearance must emanate from a representation made by the principal. Representations can take the form of words or conduct. Express communication is not essential. Representations can be (and are often) implied from conduct (<em>Freeman and Lockyer (a firm) v Buckhurst Park Properties (Mangal) and Another</em> [1964] 1 All ER 630 (“<em>Freeman</em>”) at 644-645). Such conduct can include acquiescence (<em>Viet Hai Petroleum Corp v Ng Jun Quan and another and another matter</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19040-SSP.xml')">[2016] 3 SLR 887</a> (“<em>Viet Hai</em>”) at [33]-[34] and <em>Freeman</em> at 641). It can even extend to inactivity (<em>Viet Hai</em> at [33]-[34] and <em>Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas Pacific Carriers</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('http://classic.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinosrch.cgi?results=200;query=au/cases/cth/HCA/2004/35.html')">[2004] HCA 35</a> (“<em>Pacific Carriers</em>”) at [31], [34], [40]-[43]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the wide ambit of conduct that can constitute representation, it has been observed that the word “representation” probably carries “too specific connotations”, and the word “manifestation” might be a better word to describe such conduct (<em>Chitty on Contracts</em>, vol 2 (Thomson Reuters, 33<sup>rd</sup> Ed, 2018) (“<em>Chitty on Contracts</em>”) at para 31-056 and footnote 337). But to maintain consistency of jurisprudential terminology, I would use the word “representation” in this judgment.</a></p><a id="p1_32"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal’s conduct must be considered as a whole to determine whether it had made any representation to the contractor (<em>Viet Hai</em> at [33]). If the principal is found to have represented that the agent was authorised to transact, the agent could be held to have the apparent authority to bind the principal.</a></p><a id="p1_33"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The classic test for determining apparent authority can be found in the oft-cited landmark decision of <em>Freeman</em>. In that case, one of the directors of the defendant-company’s board of directors employed a firm of architects and surveyors to apply for planning permission in respect of a property owned by the company. Having performed the contracted work but not received payment of their fees, the firm of architects and surveyors sued the company. The English Court of Appeal held that while the director had no actual authority to engage the firm, he had the apparent authority to do so. Such authority emanated from the fact that the director was, with the knowledge of the board, acting throughout as if he were himself the owner of the property, appearing on television and behaving as such, and acting as though he was the managing director of the company. Such knowledge and acquiescence of the director’s actions was sufficient to clothe the director with the apparent authority to transact for the company (<em>per</em> Willmar LJ at 636, Pearson LJ at 614 and Diplock LJ at 648). The act of engaging the firm of architects and surveyors to do what they did was held to have fallen within the ordinary ambit of the authority of a managing director. In arriving at his decision, Diplock LJ summarised the four conditions that must be satisfied to entitle the contractor to enforce against a company a contract entered into on behalf of the company by an agent who had no actual authority to do so (at 646):</a></p><a id="p1_34"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34"></a><a id="p1_34-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that a representation that the agent had the authority to enter on behalf of the company into a contract of the kind sought to be enforced was made to the contractor;</a></p><a id="p1_34-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_34-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that such representation was made by a person or persons who had “actual” authority to manage the business of the company either generally or in respect of those matters to which the contract relates;</a></p><a id="p1_34-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_34-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he (the contractor) was induced by such representation to enter into the contract, i.e. that he in fact relied on it; and</a></p><a id="p1_34-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_34-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that under its memorandum or articles of association the company was not deprived of the capacity either to enter into a contract of the kind sought to be enforced or to delegate authority to enter into a contract of that kind to the agent.</a></p><a id="p1_34-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This test has been endorsed and applied in many subsequent decisions. In Singapore, this test was most recently endorsed and applied in the High Court decision of <em>B High House International Pte Ltd v MCDP Phoenix Services Pte Ltd and another</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29200-SSP.xml')">[2023] SGHC 12</a> (“<em>B High House</em>”) at [142]. I note in parenthesis that the fourth condition has been watered down by abolishment of the statutory requirement to include clauses that would determine the capacity of the company to transact (see Tan Cheng Han <em>SC</em>, <em>The Law of Agency</em> (Singapore Academy of Law, 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition, 2017) (“<em>The Law of Agency</em>”) at [05.091]). I shall refer to the classic formulation as the “<em>Freeman</em> Formulation”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to rationalise the <em>Freeman</em> Formulation is to say that the principal should be held responsible for the contract signed by the agent because he was at fault for holding out the agent to have authority to transact on behalf of the company.</a></p><a id="p1_36"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my survey of the jurisprudence, however, I noticed that it is not uncommon for courts to consider whether the <em>contractor</em> was <em>at fault</em> for relying on the principal’s representation, even though this does not expressly feature in the <em>Freeman</em> Formulation. The <em>Freeman</em> Formulation only requires the contractor to have relied on the representation.

This is notwithstanding the fact the manager’s actual authority was limited to the mortgage arm of the company’s business. What happened in that case was that the manager convinced his mortgage customer to fork out A$4 million for an investment. The manager fraudulently applied the money and subsequently became bankrupt. The customer sued the company for recovery. While it was undisputed that the company did not sanction the fraud, and that its principal scope of business was in mortgages, the court found it significant that the company had, on its website which the customer saw before making his investment, prominently showed its name and described itself an institution that provides mortgage loans and an established fund manager. While the fund management business was provided by a different arm of the business, the website did not specify that the office in which the rogue manager resided was an independent business. In fact, the name of fund management arm of the business, “Morgan Brooks Group” was displayed on the signboard in the foyer of the building and on the entry to the office where the rogue manager resided. Inside his office, the customer observed brochures, office letterhead and business cards bearing the name “Morgan Brooks Group”. Again, there was no signage in the office to inform the customer that the mortgage arm stood as an independent business. All of these led the court to conclude that the company held out the rogue manager as having apparent authority to enter into an investment contract. Accordingly, the company was bound by the investment contract. <em>Heperu</em>, though reversed on a different point on appeal, was cited approvingly by the Singapore High Court in <em>Viet Hai</em> at [35].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48">48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Gurtner</em>, a decision that was followed by the court in <em>Heperu</em>, also involved a situation where a person vested with the title “aviation manager” entered into a contract that bound that company, even though the contract was not sanctioned by the company. The contract was for air taxi services. Unfortunately, a plane performing the air taxi service crashed. The passengers sued the company for damages. The company disclaimed liability, submitting that the manager was acting for himself, and not the company, when he contracted to provide air taxi services. On the facts, it was found that the manager knew the company did not have the requisite permits and licenses to perform air taxi services. He also knew the company did not permit him to do so. He was a part-time employee. His job was to teach the company’s employees to fly and supervise the maintenance of several aircraft owned by the company. Behind the company’s back, the manager entered multiple transactions for air taxi services over several months. Despite all these, the English Court of Appeal held that the company was bound by the contract. The court found that the company had represented that the manager was authorised to enter into those contracts by causing or permitting the employee to act as an aviation manager at the airport where he had suitable aircraft under his control and by permitting him so to act without any express limitation on his apparent authority (at 379). The placing of the name “Cleanacres Aviation” over the door of the office also gave the impression that the services were lawful (at 378).</a></p><a id="p1_48"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a><a id="p1_49">49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>The Raffaella</em>, a bank employee issued a guarantee in favour of the claimant promising to make irrevocable payment if a vessel did not arrive at the contractually designated port on certain terms. The guarantee was signed only by the employee, who was designated as a “manager” of its documentary credits department. It also carried the bank’s stamp. However, the manager did not have actual authority to sign the guarantee. He also concealed the issuance of the guarantee from his superiors. The claimant sued the bank to enforce the guarantee. The English Court of Appeal held that the manager had the apparent authority to sign the guarantee because of his “manager” title. It was reasonable to expect a “manager” of a documentary credits department to have the authority to issue such guarantees. In so holding, the court considered the expert’s evidence was that it was general practice, or at the very least “not unusual”, for a manager of a merchant bank to commit to undertakings of this nature as the sole signatory (at 412, 417 and 422). The court also found that there was no way the claimant could know for certain what the bank’s signing requirements were.</a></p><a id="p1_49"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a><a id="p1_50">50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Pacific Carriers</em> is also a case that involved a “manager” of the documentary credits department that signed off documents which the court held was binding on the bank. In that case, the manager signed two letters of indemnity in the space reserved for “Banker’s signature”. She also affixed the bank’s stamp. The letters of indemnity were signed without actual authority. The department she was in did not have the authority to issue indemnities. The manager’s duties included supervising the day-to-day handling of import/export letters of credit, the day-to-day handling of import/export collections, and the staff of the documentary credit department. The issuance of indemnities and guarantees was the function of the guarantee loan department, and not the documentary credit department. Further, guarantees and indemnities were to be signed under a power of attorney. An internal bank instruction, provided also to agents and correspondents, dealt with authorisation to sign documents. All commercial bills of exchange and certificates of deposit were to be signed by two persons, one of whom had to be an “A” signatory. Other correspondence or documents to bind the bank had to bear two signatures. The manager was an ordinary signatory, not an “A” signatory. In penning her signature, the manager was seeking to verify the letter of indemnity. The bank contended that they were not bound by the letters of indemnity. The High Court of Australia disagreed.</a></p><a id="p1_50"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a><a id="p1_51">51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court held that the bank failed to establish appropriate internal procedures to protect itself from unauthorised conduct. Issuing a letter of indemnity was a transaction forming part of its ordinary business. The court also placed importance on the affixation of a stamp designed for use on letters of credit. The manager was given the stamp without any instructions as to how she should use it. There were no procedures within the bank under which she was to seek legal advice about the manner and form of the bank’s signature. She was placed in a position to sign and stamp the documents, without any internal check upon their final form, and without qualification or limitation of the capacity in which the bank was participating in the transaction (at [31], [34], [40]-[43]).</a></p><a id="p1_51"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a><a id="p1_52">52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I come to the case of <em>First Energy</em>. The case is unique for its holding that the senior manager, while having no authority to approve a credit facility for the bank in which he was employed and having made known the same to the claimant, was clothed with the apparent authority to <em>communicate</em> that the bank’s head office had approved the agreements in question. In that case, the claimant sought financing from the defendant bank, which had its head office in London and a branch office in Manchester. The claimant negotiated with the senior manager of the bank’s Manchester office, who had authority to sanction large credit transactions and sign facility letters. However, at an advanced stage of the negotiations, the manager told the claimant that he had no authority to sanction a credit facility for the amount asked for. The manager offered three interim hire purchase facilities which the claimant signed. The bank’s senior management however decided not to be involved in the claimant’s business. The claimant sued the bank to enforce the facility agreements. The English Court of Appeal held that not holding the bank liable would “frustrate the reasonable expectations of the parties” (at 1411). Steyn LJ held that the idea that the claimant should have checked with the managing director in London on whether the bank had approved the transactions seemed unreal and would defeat the reasonable expectations of the parties (at 1423). Evans LJ held that it would be commercial nonsense if every bank customer had to ensure whether the senior manager had authority to sign a letter (at 1425).</a></p><a id="p1_52"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a><a id="p1_53">53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Locally, <em>First Energy</em> was followed in <em>Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd v Jurong Engineering Ltd and others</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2000] 1 SLR(R) 0204.xml')">[2000] 1 SLR(R) 204</a> (“<em>HSBC</em>”). Tay Yong Kwang JC (as he then was) found the holding in <em>First Energy</em> to apply squarely to the case before him. In that case, he found that by placing an employee in the position of “General Manager of Finance and Administration”, the company had held out him out as having “the usual authority to sign and send letters on behalf of the [company]”. And given that the company had also acquiesced the employee’s past conduct of making representations to the claimants on behalf of the company on matters concerning the company’s subsidiary’s credit facilities, he found that the employee had apparent authority to communicate that the necessary authority and approval had been obtained from the company for him to make an offer to compromise outstanding debts owing to the company (at [71]).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Cases where Manager held to have no apparent authority to contract</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54">54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the apparent authority of a manager is not a foregone conclusion in every case. In fact, it is far from so. There are various cases where the court refused to find apparent authority in managers. The Court of Appeal decision of <em>Skandinaviska</em> is one such case. In that case, the finance manager of a company perpetuated fraud on various banks. Purporting to act on behalf of the company, the manager requested the banks to offer various credit facilities to the company. He then accepted the credit facilities in the company’s name and gave the banks forged resolutions of the company’s board of directors purportedly documenting the company’s acceptance of the credit facilities. The sums defrauded were huge, amounting to around $45m. The court declined to bind the company to those facilities. It held that the title “finance manager” did not connote the possession of any specific authority. The employee was a finance manager of one company in a large corporate group, a position that would carry with it less general authority than the position of a general manager. Its authority was also not well known to the commercial world. Further, the senior management of the company was also within the easy reach of the banks (at [51]-[53]).</a></p><a id="p1_54"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a><a id="p1_55">55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of <em>Armagas</em> is another instance where the court refused to find apparent authority. In that case, the employee, designated as chartering manager (and vice-president of transportation) received a bribe to enter into three-year charterparty. The bribe was given because the company was only prepared to accept a one-year charterparty. The company returned the ship after one year. The counterparty sued the company for breach of contract. The English Court of Appeal held that the employee did not have apparent authority to enter into the contract. The claimant knew he had no authority to sign a three-year charter. But relying on information conveyed by the broker, they believed the employee had obtained the necessary approval from his superiors. There was no representation by the company that the employee had authority to either conclude the transaction or communicate the approval of the board. Further, the charter had extraordinary features. First, a secrecy provision, second, minimum charter rates, and third, an option to cancel given to the claimant. The court found that these features should have put the claimant on inquiry. While the employee was entrusted on two previous occasions with the task of informing the claimant that the board approval had been obtained with in respect of transactions, they were very different from the present transaction. They involved a two-month charterparty with an option to purchase and a 30-month charterparty. The present transaction involved not only a three-year charterparty, but the inclusion of extraordinary terms (at 815 and 830).</a></p><a id="p1_55"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a><a id="p1_56">56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in <em>British Bank of the Middle East v Sun Life Assurance Co of Canada (UK) Ltd</em> [1983] BCLC 78 (“<em>Sun Life Assurance</em>”), the House of Lords held that, in the context of an insurance company, a branch manager of that company had no authority to approve an undertaking made by another employee for the company to pay money to a bank on the happening of certain events. The undertaking was issued initially by a unit manager in favour of the bank. The bank, unsure of his authority, sought conformation from the company’s general manger. It received such confirmation however from the “general manager” of one of its branch offices. When the company refused to honour the undertaking, the bank sued to recover payment. The court held that the bank was wrong to rely on the branch manager’s confirmation. The branch manager had no authority to sign any contract of any kind on behalf of the company (at 86). This was because it was commonplace amongst insurance companies to place limitations on the authority of branch managers. I note however that the outcome in <em>Sun Life Assurance</em> has been described as “harsh” for persons who quite reasonably have no knowledge of the practice within insurance companies (FMB Reynolds in “The Ultimate Apparent Authority” (1994) 110 LQR 21 at 22; see also <em>Chitty on Contracts</em> at p 40, footnote 360).</a></p><a id="p1_56"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">My views</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a><a id="p1_57">57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have discussed the case law at some length to show that it is possible for a manager to have apparent authority to transact on behalf of a company. The lengthy discussion is also in part necessitated by the complexity of the law in this field. Indeed, more than fifty years ago, Diplock LJ remarked that state of the law on apparent authority is a topic on which there were “confusing and, it may be, conflicting judgments of the Court of Appeal” (<em>Freeman</em> at 643). He further remarked that this branch of the law has developed “pragmatically rather than logically”. Despite his attempt to “restate it on a rational basis”, subsequent cases have sometimes shown a preference to approach the issue pragmatically. As Lord Neuberger observed some fifty years later, the cases on apparent authority are not “easy to reconcile in every respect” and that the law in this field “struggles to reconcile principle and predictability with commercial reality and fairness” (<em>Thanakharn</em> at [41] and [70]).</a></p><a id="p1_57"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a><a id="p1_58">58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant submitted that a manager does not have the apparent authority to contract on behalf of a company. For the above reasons stated, I disagree with this submission. It is apparent from the authorities that a manager can possess apparent authority to bind the company to contracts.</a></p><a id="p1_58"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a><a id="p1_59">59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant cited the following passage in the District Court decision of <em>Pure Group (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Siong Ann Engineering Pte Ltd</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26612-SSP.xml')">[2021] SGDC 212</a> (“<em>Pure Group</em>”) to buttress its submission (at [87]):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Second, in relation to actual implied authority, as the senior project manager, I do not think that entering into fresh contracts on the Plaintiff’s behalf is incidental to his job, or that it can be implied to be part of his job. The authorities I have referred to earlier at [81(e)] makes it clear that even a director has no apparent authority to transact on behalf of his company. It follows that a director would equally not ordinarily have any actual implied authority to transact on his company’s behalf. If that is so, then I do not see how a senior project manager such as Mr Tan who is not a director of the Plaintiff and in fact is not even the Plaintiff’s employee (as he had been seconded from the Plaintiff’s Malaysian sister company) could possess actual implied authority to enter into contracts on the Plaintiff’s behalf.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60">60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the above holding was made in relation to actual implied authority and not apparent authority. In this regard, the court emphasised that the employee who purportedly entered the contract on the company’s behalf was not an employee of that company but a secondee from a sister company. In any event, insofar that the Defendant is submitting that the reasoning is equally applicable to apparent authority, I would respectfully disagree as that goes against the weight of the authorities discussed above. The authorities make clear that managers can have apparent authority to contract for the company. None of these authorities were considered in <em>Pure Group</em>. In fact, the High Court in <em>Viet Hai</em> observed the contrary, that managers can have the apparent authority to contract for the company (citing <em>Heperu</em>). I also note that the <em>Pure Group</em> was reversed on appeal in <em>Siong Ann Engineering Pte Ltd v Pure Group (Singapore) Pte Ltd</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27348-SSP.xml')">[2022] SGHC 73</a>. For all these reasons, I am of the view that the case is of limited precedential value at least insofar as the present case is concerned.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61">61&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Precedents aside, perhaps another way to look at the matter is to consider a hypothetical situation that is often encountered in our daily lives. It is not uncommon for customers of a grocery or departmental store to be served by its manager. Ordinarily, customers looking to make a purchase would have no qualms transacting with the manager. The customer often relies on the apparent authority of the manager to complete the transaction. But if we take the Defendant’s submission to its logical conclusion, customers can no longer seek comfort in relying on the apparent authority of managers, even for the most routine and mundane transactions. The effect of the Defendant’s submission is that customers would have to independently verify the manager’s authority with the company’s senior management or board of directors. Such an outcome in my view defies commercial logic. It defeats the very purpose of employing agents to ensure the smooth running of a company’s daily operations.</a></p><a id="p1_61"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a><a id="p1_62">62&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I raise the hypothetical not because it has a direct bearing to the present case, but simply to illustrate that we live in an imperfect world where the hustle and bustle of commerce does not always afford us with the luxury of conducting due diligence into the scope of authority of the persons with whom we transact. A balance must be struck between efficiency and diligence. Life would be unbearable if parties are made to conduct extensive due diligence for every single transaction they enter into, regardless of its nature and quantum. It is therefore not only natural but reasonable for parties to often transact based on the authority that the agent appears to have. Whether that impression is legitimately formed or misconceived is a question of judgment. It is necessarily shaped by the factual matrix of each case and cannot be reduced to a rigid formula.</a></p><a id="p1_62"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a><a id="p1_63">63&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the above reasons stated, I hold that a manager can possess apparent authority to bind a company to contracts. Whether such authority arises is a question of fact that should be determined on a case-by-case basis (see also <em>The Raffaella</em> at 417). To quote the trial judge in <em>The Raffaella</em> (at 410), in determining what is usually or ordinarily expected to be within the scope of an employee, the court should consider all material circumstances including but not limited to:</a></p><a id="p1_63"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63"></a><a id="p1_63-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the kind of business carried on by the principal;</a></p><a id="p1_63-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_63-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the role of the employee; and</a></p><a id="p1_63-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_63-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current business practices.</a></p><a id="p1_63-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_64">64&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the above list of factors, I would add that the quantum and significance of the transaction could also be a relevant consideration. The larger the transaction, the more prudent the contractor may need to be when evaluating the agent’s apparent authority. Indeed, it has been observed that it may be reasonable to expect the contractor to verify the agent’s authority where the transaction is “a complex one involving a large sum and where the agent’s authority is known to be limited” (<em>The Law of Agency</em> at [05.054]). In my view, the massive size of the credit facilities in <em>Skandinaviska</em> was perhaps partly the reason why the court said the banks could have verified the finance manager’s authority with the senior management. Conversely, for routine and inconsequential transactions, it may not always be commercially sensible for contractors to verify the agent’s authority, particularly if doing so would incur business costs that are incommensurate with the transaction.</a></p><a id="p1_64"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a><a id="p1_65">65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another factor that may require consideration is whether the contract is abnormal in the context of the principal’s business practices and the prevailing market practices. In <em>Armagas</em>, Stephenson LJ held that abnormality is always an important circumstance, and in that case, it was “decisive”. He held that the employee did was so clearly and extravagantly unusual for a man in his position that it should not only have put the contractor on inquiry but also it fell outside of his authority (at 830).</a></p><a id="p1_65"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a><a id="p1_66">66&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparent authority can also arise from a course of dealing. For instance, in <em>Pharmed Medicare Private Ltd v Univar Ltd</em> [2002] All ER 31, the court held that a company was bound by purchase orders placed by an employee who had previously placed orders that were honoured.</a></p><a id="p1_66"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a><a id="p1_67">67&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, I am of the view that the following non-exhaustive list of factors may be considered when assessing whether a manager is sufficiently clothed with apparent authority to contract for the employer:</a></p><a id="p1_67"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67"></a><a id="p1_67-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the nature of the business carried on by the principal;</a></p><a id="p1_67-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_67-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the role of the employee;</a></p><a id="p1_67-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_67-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the current business practices;</a></p><a id="p1_67-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_67-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the quantum and significance of the transaction;</a></p><a id="p1_67-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_67-p2_e">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the abnormality (if any) of the transaction; and</a></p><a id="p1_67-p2_e"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_e"></a><a id="p1_67-p2_f">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the course of dealings (if any) between the parties.</a></p><a id="p1_67-p2_f"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67-p2_f"></a><a id="p1_68">68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this legal backdrop in mind, I turn to consider whether the manager in the present case had apparent authority to bind the Defendant to the contract with the Plaintiff.</a></p><a id="p1_68"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether Ms Leong had apparent authority to contract for the Defendant</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a><a id="p1_69">69&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant contended that the sole representation made by the Defendant as to the scope of Ms Leong’s authority was the business card which stated that Ms Leong was a “Manager” of the Defendant. I am unable to agree with this submission. The business card goes beyond representing that Ms Leong was a Manager of the Defendant. The business card represented that the Defendant was a company that specialises in the following works:</a></p><a id="p1_69"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Electrical Works, Carpentry Works, LED Lighting, Data, Voice, CCTV, Security System, Fibre Optique [<em>sic</em>], Service &amp; Maintenance, Renovation, 3D Interior Drawing, Data Centre, Painting Works, Ceiling / Partition Works</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a><a id="">I will refer to this collectively as the “Works”.</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_70">70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This informs a reasonable person standing in the shoes of the Plaintiff that Ms Leong has the authority to manage the Works. It is undisputed that at least some of the Works require construction-related skillsets, such as electrical works and partition works. After all, the Defendant is a company that specialises in renovation works.</a></p><a id="p1_70"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a><a id="p1_71">71&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It cannot be seriously disputed that such works are labour intensive. The utilisation of skilled labour to carry out such works falls within the ordinary scope of the Defendant’s business. Since Ms Leong appears to have been authorised to manage the Works, it is not surprising that she would have been perceived to be authorised to deploy labour to carry out the Works.</a></p><a id="p1_71"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a><a id="p1_72">72&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts of this case are analogous to that in <em>Heperu</em> and <em>Gurtner</em>. In both these cases, the company held out the employee in question as its manager. Beyond that, the companies gave third parties the impression of what their businesses entailed. In the case of <em>Heperu</em>, the company referred to the “Morgan Brooks Group” as an “established Fund Manager within the Banking and Finance industry”. The court found that this gave the claimant the impression that the employee was authorised to enter into contracts for the investment of funds, even though his actual authority was confined to mortgage contracts. In <em>Gurtner</em>, the court found that the company, by permitting the employee to have aircraft under his control without express limitations, represented to the claimants that he was authorised to use the aircraft for air taxi services.</a></p><a id="p1_72"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a><a id="p1_73">73&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In similar vein, the High Court observed in <em>Sigma Cable Co (Pte) Ltd v NEI Parsons Ltd</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1992] 2 SLR(R) 0403.xml')">[1992] 2 SLR(R) 403</a> (“<em>Sigma Cable</em>”) that the decision to purchase from suppliers and the price to be paid are matters within the scope of duties of the manager or other persons specially authorised by the management of the company (at [34]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74">74&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the Defendant held out Ms Leong as a Manager who was authorised to manage the Works. Contracting for the supply of workers to carry out such works fell within the ordinary scope of her office.</a></p><a id="p1_74"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a><a id="p1_75">75&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to address the various arguments raised by the Defendant.</a></p><a id="p1_75"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a><a id="p1_76">76&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Defendant argued that the hiring skilled foreign workers in the construction field was not incidental to Ms Leong’s job, given that the Defendant is a renovation company with no need for construction workers. I am unable to agree this submission as it is not borne out in evidence.</a></p><a id="p1_76"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76"></a><a id="p1_76-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant failed to prove that the contracted workers were meant to perform works that fell outside of the Works mentioned in the business card. On the contrary, the evidence led shows that the contracted workers could well have performed the tasks falling within the scope of the Works. In this regard, Mr Foong’s evidence was that Ms Leong requested for the manpower to move materials and perform miscellaneous work.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a> Ms Leong’s evidence was that the workers also performed “hacking” works.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> It cannot be seriously disputed that renovation works could entail hacking works.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, the Defendant’s business card itself suggests that it does construction-related work. The business card bears a logo that reads “BCA Registered Contractor”. It cannot be disputed that “BCA” stands for the Building and Construction Authority. Indeed, the Defendant’s name “ST Powa Construction Engineering Pte Ltd”, which was printed on the business card, suggests that construction works are part of its business.</a></p><a id="p1_76-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_77">77&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Defendant submitted that it was not reasonable for the Plaintiff to solely rely on Ms Leong’s signature, since it was not accompanied by the Defendant’s company stamp. The Defendant’s Mr Khing testified that the company stamp was kept by him as only he could authorise transactions. The Defendant pointed to a term in the Plaintiff’s quotation form that requires the contract to be signed and stamped. But as I mentioned to counsel for the Defendant in his oral submissions, that is a requirement imposed by the Plaintiff, not the Defendant, which the Plaintiff has evidently decided to waive in this instance. When queried whether there are any authorities or principle that puts the contractor on notice or on inquiry when the agent signs a contract without a company stamp, he said he was unable to find any. Instead, he submitted that it is common practice for contracts to bear the company stamp. But the Defendant led no evidence to prove that this is indeed common practice.</a></p><a id="p1_77"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a><a id="p1_78">78&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant was also unable to identify any relevant legal authority to make good this proposition. On the contrary, it has been said that rubber stamps are not a common feature in modern day business transactions that are often made over electronic mediums. In <em>Wilh. Wilhelmsen Investments Pty Ltd v SSS Holdings Pty Ltd</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('http://classic.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinosrch.cgi?results=200;query=au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2019/32.html')">[2019] NSWCA 32</a>, the New South Wales Court of Appeal held that:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Modern day business communications, including those for the purchase of goods, are often less formal and unaccompanied by seals and other formalities … They are often made via the medium of email, with electronic signatures and scanned documents attached. They emanate from specific and identifiable email addresses. The language used is often informal and familiar, having regard to previous communications between the individuals sending and receiving them.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79">79&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore High Court in <em>Sigma Cable</em> also observed that a generic rubber stamp did not amount to a representation that the employee who used it had the authority to bind the company, insofar as they are “commonly kept by clerical or secretarial staff and are used everyday” (at [41]).</a></p><a id="p1_79"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a><a id="p1_80">80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant also submitted that the Plaintiff had the opportunity to verify Ms Leong’s authority. Undoubtedly, they did. But to my mind, the real question is whether the Plaintiff <em>should have</em> taken steps to verify Ms Leong’s authority. As I mentioned above, contractors are not always required to take such steps. In many of the cases discussed above, courts have allowed contractors to rely on the agent’s apparent authority, even though the contractor did not verify the agent’s authority with the company’s senior management. In the present case, I do not think the Plaintiff should be faulted for having relied on the representations made by the Defendant as to Ms Leong’s authority. This is not like the case of <em>Armagas</em> where what the employee did was so extravagant that it put the contractor on inquiry as to his authority to contract. The contract that Ms Leong signed appears to be within the ordinary scope of the Defendant’s business. The quantum of the contract is not extraordinary. It is a basic supply of labour contract, at $10 per man hour. While the invoiced sum amounted to $25,130, which is not an insignificant figure, there is no evidence to suggest that the Plaintiff was aware at the time of the contract that the Defendant would eventually incur that many man-hours to produce a bill of this size. As the author of <em>The Law of Agency</em> observed, agency law “does not require a third party to make inquiries where there is nothing to indicate that an agent is acting outside the scope of the agent’s usual authority” (at [05.072]).</a></p><a id="p1_80"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a><a id="p1_81">81&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Defendant sought to rely on Mr Khing’s evidence that Ms Leong was only an “<em>ad hoc</em>” employee who did not possess the authority to contract on his behalf, and her role was to introduce potential renovation customers to the Defendant, and from that point onwards Mr Khing would decide whether to enter into a contract. With respect, while this may well be the arrangement between the Defendant and Ms Leong, this is more relevant to the assessment of Ms Leong’s actual authority. Apparent authority focuses on what Ms Leong’s authority <em>appears</em> to third parties. The distinction between actual and apparent authority was explained by Diplock LJ as follows (<em>Freeman</em> at 644):</a></p><a id="p1_81"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">An ”actual” authority is a legal relationship between principal and agent created by a consensual agreement to which they alone are parties. Its scope is to be ascertained by applying ordinary principles of construction of contracts, including any proper implications from the express words used, the usages of the trade, or the course of business between parties. To this agreement the contractor is a stranger; he may be totally ignorant of the existence of any authority on the part of the agent. Nevertheless, if the agent does enter into a contract pursuant to the “actual” authority, it does create contractual rights and liabilities between the principal and the contractor. …</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">An “apparent” or “ostensible” authority, on the other hand, is a legal relationship between the principal and the contractor created by a representation, made by the principal to the contractor, … acted on by the contractor, that the agent has authority to enter on behalf of the principal into a contract of a kind within the scope of the “apparent” authority, so as to render the principal liable to perform any obligations imposed on him by such a contract. To the relationship so created the agent is a stranger. He need not be (although he generally is) aware of the existence of the representation. The representation, when acted on by the contractor by entering into a contract with the agent, operates as an estoppel, preventing the principal from asserting that he is not bound by the contract. It is irrelevant whether the agent had actual authority to enter into the contract.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a><a id="p1_82">82&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, whether Ms Leong was an <em>ad hoc</em> or part-time employee of the Defendant is besides the point (see for instance, <em>Gurtner</em>). The fact of the matter is that he has chosen to designate Ms Leong as a Manager and printed the same on the Defendant’s business card, which was held out to third parties including the Plaintiff. It follows from this that he has conveyed to the Plaintiff that Ms Leong would have the usual authority of a “Manager”. If his intention was to confine her authority to introducing clients to the Defendant, he could have used a more specific designation. It is not apparent to me that the “Manager” title was necessary to perform the limited task of introducing renovation customers to the Defendant.</a></p><a id="p1_82"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a><a id="p1_83">83&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, the allegation that the Defendant had only authorised Ms Leong to introduce renovation customers stands at odds with the evidence. Mr Low’s evidence was that, prior to this contract, he had assisted the Defendant with the recruitment of workers at the request of Ms Leong. He further testified that Ms Leong was his only point of contact for such engagements. In his dealings with Ms Leong, he had the impression that Ms Leong was the person in charge of the Defendant’s operations. All of these was not challenged by the Defendant when Mr Low took the stand. The Defendant accepts that Mr Low had assisted the Defendant with the recruitment of workers, albeit electrical workers.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a> If the Defendant accepts Mr Low’s evidence as correct, it stands to reason that Ms Leong was indeed authorised to enter into contracts for the supply of labour on behalf of the Defendant. Indeed, Ms Leong testified that she had previously engaged Mr Low for foreign workers on behalf of the Defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> The Defendant’s decision to designate Ms Leong as a Manager would have to be viewed in this context.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84">84&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a related point raised by the Defendant which merits some discussion. The Defendant submitted that <em>Viet Hai</em>, a case relied on by the Plaintiff, is distinguishable because in that case the representation was affirmed by the completion of the first transaction, whereas in this case, the Defendant did not affirm the contract by making payment.</a></p><a id="p1_84"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a><a id="p1_85">85&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the completion of prior transactions is relevant to assessing apparent authority, it is not a necessary condition. Courts have found apparent authority in the absence of prior transactions (see cases discussed at [47]-[53] above). In fact, in <em>Viet Hai</em>, the court found the employee’s title as “Chief Operations Officer” to be sufficient representation as to the authority to bind the company. That the first transaction concluded successfully merely <em>affirmed</em> that representation (at [38]). I should also add that it is not clear to me that the present contract should be viewed as though the parties were two strangers dealing for the first time. The Plaintiff was after all introduced to Ms Leong by Mr Low, with whom in his capacity as a recruitment agent, had prior dealings. While Mr Low did not expressly say that he had conveyed these prior dealings to Mr Foong when he was introducing Ms Leong to him, he did tell Mr Foong that Ms Leong was the person who made the request for labour and told Mr Foong to contact her. It was in these circumstances that Mr Foong formed the impression that Ms Leong was the person in-charge of hiring these workers.</a></p><a id="p1_85"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a><a id="p1_86">86&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these reasons, I find that Ms Leong had the apparent authority to bind the Defendant to the contract with the Plaintiff.</a></p><a id="p1_86"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the contract is void for illegality</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a><a id="p1_87">87&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant also submitted that the contract should be void for illegality under the EFMR.</a></p><a id="p1_87"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a><a id="p1_88">88&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant submitted that the statutory regulation prohibits employers from permitting foreign employees to be employed by or contracted to another business to do work. In this regard, the Defendant cited paragraph 4 of the Fourth Schedule, Part V, of the EFMR, which states:</a></p><a id="p1_88"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to paragraph 6, the employer shall not permit the foreign employee to be employed by or contracted to any other person or business to do work for that person or business.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a><a id="p1_89">89&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as the Defendant itself conceded, paragraph 4 is subject to paragraph 6 of the said regulation, which reads:</a></p><a id="p1_89"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Notwithstanding paragraph 4, an employer may, with the consent of the foreign employee, enter into a contract for the supply of labour with an eligible third party engaged in the construction industry, in relation to a foreign employee to whom the regulatory conditions in this Part and the conditions in Part VI apply.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a><a id="p1_90">90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 6 provides an exception to the rule in paragraph 4. It allows the employer to enter into a contract for the supply of labour with “an eligible third party”.</a></p><a id="p1_90"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a><a id="p1_91">91&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No evidence was led by either party on whether the Defendant was an “eligible third party”. Indeed, the Defendant itself takes the view that it is “unclear” whether the Defendant is an “eligible third party”. As I highlighted to counsel for the Defendant in his oral submissions, the paucity of evidence on this issue was brought about by the Defendant’s failure to put illegality into issue in its Defence. Consequently, the Plaintiff had no notice of this allegation and led no evidence to refute the same. It seems to me that the Plaintiff is prejudiced by the Defendant’s failure to plead this issue. Had the Defendant done so, the Plaintiff could well have led evidence to prove that the Defendant was an “eligible third party”. That the Defendant itself is unable to confirm whether it is an “eligible third party” and in fact led no evidence to prove that it was not such a party leaves open the possibility that it was such a party, in which case the exception in paragraph 6 could well have been applicable.</a></p><a id="p1_91"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a><a id="p1_92">92&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counsel for the Defendant explained that the issue was not pleaded because the Defendant only “discovered that the work permits of the workers during the course of drafting his AEIC”. I find no merit in this argument. As I pointed out to counsel for the Defendant during his oral submissions, it was open to the Defendant to apply to amend its pleadings before trial, if it was serious about pursuing this line of argument. This would have put the Plaintiff on notice of this issue and given them an opportunity to address this in evidence.</a></p><a id="p1_92"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a><a id="p1_93">93&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant sought to overcome its failure to plead this issue by reference to the case of <em>Koon Seng Construction Pte Ltd v Chenab Contractor Pte Ltd and another</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 1 SLR(R) 0375.xml')">[2008] 1 SLR(R) 375</a>. The court in that case held that the court is at liberty to invoke the doctrine of illegality, on its own motion, even when it is not pleaded, if illegality is <em>plain</em> from the evidence (at [31]). But as I mentioned to counsel for the Defendant in his oral submissions, this principle does not apply in the present case since evidence of the alleged illegality is far from plain.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94">94&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am fortified in my view by the recent decision of <em>Rio Christofle v Tan Chun Chuen Malcolm</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29503-SSP.xml')">[2023] SGHC 66</a>, where the High Court similarly held that the court must be satisfied that “all the relevant facts are before it and it can see clearly from them that the contract had an illegal object” (at [50], citing <em>Edler v Auerbach</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/English/61357-E-M.xml')">[1950] 1 KB 359</a> at 371 and <em>Ting Siew May v Boon Lay Choo and another</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 3 SLR 0609.xml')">[2014] 3 SLR 609</a> at [29]).

The Defendant submits that the Plaintiff should not be allowed to rely on the timecards.</a></p><a id="p1_98"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a><a id="p1_99">99&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff took issue with the Defendant not having pleaded this “defence”. I should say at the outset that I disagree with the Plaintiff’s submission. It is trite that the claimant bears the burden of proving at least a <em>prima facie</em> case even if the defendant elects no case to answer (<em>Viet Hai</em> at [15]-[18]). The Plaintiff bears the burden of proving that it had provided the services for which it is now claiming.</a></p><a id="p1_99"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a><a id="p1_100">100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant’s case is essentially that the Plaintiff failed to discharge that burden. I am unable to agree with this submission. Mr Foong’s sole point of contact for this contract was Ms Leong, who testified that the Plaintiff did provide the workers from 1 June 2019 to 15 July 2019.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a> She further testified that Shariff signed off the timecards from 1 June 2019 to 15 June 2019, whereas she signed off the timecards from 16 June 2019 to 15 July 2019.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> At no point in time, even during this trial, did Ms Leong challenge the veracity of the timecards. The authenticity of the timecards was also not challenged. According to her communications with Shariff, the only complaint Shariff had was that some of the workers were not good enough.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> While Shariff was not called to give evidence, Ms Leong’s testimony should be given some weight as, according to her, she was “also running this project as the person in charge at the Bukit Timah site”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> In my view, the Plaintiff has established at least a <em>prima facie</em> case, upon which the burden shifts to the Defendant to lead rebuttal evidence. The Defendant did not do so.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101">101&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also seems to me that the timecards are in any event admissible under the “business records” exception to the hearsay rule pursuant to s 32(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, Rev Ed 1997). However, since neither party made submissions on this issue, I would not make a specific finding on the applicability of this provision. Suffice to say, Ms Leong, with whom the Plaintiff liaised, likely had personal knowledge of the supply of workers.</a></p><a id="p1_101"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a><a id="p1_102">102&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the above reasons stated, I allow the Plaintiff’s claim.
