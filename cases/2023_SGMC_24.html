On the one hand, the amendment may be required to enable the real questions in controversy between the correct parties to be determined in a single forum. On the other hand, the amendment can effectively permit the applicant to prosecute a claim which would otherwise have been time-barred if it were brought as a new action. This is why the law only permits these amendments under limited circumstances. One such circumstance is when the amendment is to correct the name of a party, if there was a genuine mistake and there was no reasonable doubt that the respondent was always the party intended to be sued. This is so even if the effect of the amendment is to substitute a new party into the proceedings.</a></p><a id="p1_1"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is the scope of an amendment to correct the name of a party? If the applicant first discontinues a claim against the wrong party, and <em>subsequently</em> seeks to add the correct party as a defendant to the suit, would this be considered a correction of the name of a party? This is the main issue in the present application. Having considered the case law and submissions, I find that at its heart, such an application to add the correct party as defendant is the final step in a broader effort to <em>correct</em> the wrongly added party and replace it with the proper defendant. This falls within the exception in which an amendment ought to be allowed, even after the expiry of the limitation period. I thus allowed the application. These are the reasons for my decision.</a></p><a id="p1_2"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background to the suit</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present suit arises from an industrial accident. The plaintiff is a construction worker. The first and second defendants are companies incorporated in Singapore. The first defendant was the plaintiff’s employer at the time of the accident and supplied labour at a construction worksite known as “Yishun Street 44, Contingency works – Contract No. D/453/17” (“the Worksite”), where the plaintiff was deployed. The second defendant was the main contractor at the Worksite.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff was purportedly under the supervision of one Mr Xue Hongbing (“Mr Xue”) at the Worksite. Mr Xue was employed by Weida Development Pte Ltd (“Weida Development”), another company incorporated in Singapore, which also provided labour at the Worksite.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 21 January 2019, the plaintiff was instructed to dismantle a metal formwork at the Worksite. To do so, the plaintiff stood on a scaffolding frame structure beside the metal formwork to remove the metal clips on the formwork. One of the metal clips was difficult to remove, thus the plaintiff forced it open using both his hands. As he did so, the metal clip suddenly opened. The plaintiff lost his balance and fell backwards from the scaffolding frame onto the ground.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a> On the same day, the plaintiff was seen at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, diagnosed with lumbar contusion, and given seven days of medical leave. At a subsequent follow-up at a private clinic, he was further diagnosed to have suffered soft tissue injury to the lower back region with residual disabilities, such as a reduction in the range of movements of the back.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff therefore brought Magistrate Court Suit No 6621 of 2020, alleging negligence and breach of statutory duties by the defendants as his employers and/or persons who had control and management of the Worksite.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a> The suit was initially brought only against the first and second defendants.

As such, the plaintiff had to avail himself of one of the exceptions under O 20 r 5(3)-(5) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC 2014”), which he could not.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the course of oral submissions, counsel for the first and second defendants, Ms Chee, suggested in passing that the applicable limitation period could be that under s 24A(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Act, which refers to the expiration of three years from the “earliest date on which the claimant has the knowledge required for bringing an action for damages in respect of the relevant injury”. As the plaintiff’s counsel, Mr Nagarajah S Maniam (“Mr Nagarajah”), claimed that the plaintiff only knew that Mr Xue was the plaintiff’s supervisor at the Worksite at the time of the 9 March 2021 Email, the limitation period could start running from that date instead.</a></p><a id="p1_11"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In oral reply submissions, Mr Nagarajah jumped on the bandwagon and changed his position from that set out in the supporting affidavits and written submissions. He asserted that s 24A(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Act should apply, given that the plaintiff’s knowledge of the correct defendant only accrued on 9 March 2021. The limitation period had therefore <em>not</em> expired at the time of filing the present summons on 14 September 2022, and the application should be made and decided under O 20 r 5(1) ROC 2014, in which case the Court had wider discretion to allow amendments.</a></p><a id="p1_12"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having considered the plaintiff’s shift in position, I was of the view that the issue as to which provision of the Act governed had a fundamental bearing on the present application. I therefore gave directions for the plaintiff to file a further affidavit on the issue of limitation, and in particular, to include the factual basis underpinning the applicable limitation period, bearing in mind s 24A(2), (4) and (6) of the Act. I directed Weida Development to file a reply affidavit in relation to the same issue, and for both the plaintiff and Weida Development to file further written submissions on the issue of whether s 24A(2)(<em>a</em>) or (<em>b</em>) of the Act applied, with reference to case law.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues to be determined </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues to be determined in the present case are as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_14-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which provision of the Act governs the present proceedings, and had the relevant period of limitation expired?</a></p><a id="p1_14-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_14-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the relevant limitation period had expired, do any of the exceptions in O 20 r 5(3)-(5) apply, such that an amendment can still be allowed?</a></p><a id="p1_14-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now examine each issue in turn.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 1: Which provision of the Act governs the present proceedings, and had the relevant limitation period expired? </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff confirmed that he had changed his position and was relying on s 24A(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Act, because he was only made aware of Weida Development by way of the 9 March 2021 Email.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weida Development argued that the starting point was s 24A(2)(<em>a</em>) of the Act, which dictated that the claim would have been time-barred by 21 January 2022, three years after the accident occurred. It then contended that even if s 24A(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Act applied, the limitation period would still have expired. Its main arguments were as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_17"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_17-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the latest possible date that the plaintiff acquired <em>actual knowledge</em> of Weida Development’s identity must be 3 November 2020, when the first and second defendants filed and served their defence, referring to Mr Xue of Weida <em>Development</em> (see also, the summary of procedural history at [7] above).<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, the plaintiff should have had <em>constructive knowledge</em> about Weida Development’s identity from around 19 February 2019, because he could have made enquiries with his supervisors at the Worksite or with his employers.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having considered the parties’ positions, I find that even if the plaintiff only knew about Weida Development on a date after the accident, and s 24(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Act applied, the limitation period would still have expired by the time of the present application.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starting point is that the onus is on the <em>plaintiff</em> to prove that the date on which he had the requisite knowledge was a date within the prescribed period (of three years) preceding the date of this application (see <em>Prosperland Pte Ltd v Civic Construction Pte Ltd and others</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2004] 4 SLR(R) 0129.xml')">[2004] 4 SLR(R) 129</a> (“<em>Prosperland</em>”) at [9]). In the present case, I agree with Weida Development that the plaintiff has failed to discharge this burden of proof.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first observation is that it had been the plaintiff’s consistent position – up until the middle of the hearing on 30 January 2023 – that s 24A(2)(<em>a</em>) of the Act applied. Consequently, the plaintiff had accepted that at the time of filing the present application, the limitation period would have expired as it was more than three years from the accident. It was only during the oral submissions on 30 January 2023, when the possibility of the alternative s 24A(2)(<em>b</em>) was mooted by Ms Chee, that Mr Nagarajah had an about-turn in his position. When asked about why the change in position was made so late in the day, this was attributed to an oversight by the solicitor who filed an earlier affidavit. While the plaintiff is entitled to change his position, this must be substantiated by full facts explaining the change in position, and legal submissions on the issue. As I will go on to explain, both were absent in the present case.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Nagarajah asserts that the first time the plaintiff had <em>actual knowledge</em> of Weida Development was on 9 March 2021, but Weida Development correctly pointed out that this is patently untrue. At a very early stage of proceedings, paragraph 3 of the Defence filed by the first and second defendants on 3 November 2020 already set out that the Plaintiff was “instructed by <b><em>one Xue Hongbing, who was employed by Weida Development Pte Ltd</em></b>, to dismantle the metal formworks at the Worksite” [emphasis added in bold and italics]. I therefore agree with Weida Development that the latest date that actual knowledge accrued to the plaintiff must have been 3 November 2020.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, as counsel for Weida Development, Ms Ng Kai Ling (“Ms Ng”), pointed out, the date of actual knowledge alone (3 November 2020) is not dispositive of the issue because the present application (filed on 14 September 2022) would have been within three years of that date. However, “knowledge” as defined in s 24A(6) is not confined to actual knowledge. It also includes what “<em>might</em> have existed had the plaintiff, <em>acting reasonably, acquired knowledge from the facts ascertainable by him</em> or which he could have acquired <em>with the help of such expert advice</em> which it was reasonable for him to obtain” [emphasis added]. In other words, ““knowledge” includes <em>constructive</em> knowledge (see s 24A(6) of the Act and <em>Prosperland</em> at [11]).</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The further affidavit filed on behalf of the plaintiff did not set out any factual background whatsoever about why the plaintiff could not have reasonably been expected to have acquired knowledge of Weida Development at a far earlier point in time than 3 November 2020. There was also no assistance rendered on the interplay between s 24(2)(<em>b</em>), s 24A(4) and s 24A(6) of the Act save for a vague assertion that the plaintiff’s awareness of Weida Development arose only on 9 March 2021 “and is supported by Section 24A(2)(b) and 24A(4)(b) and (6) of The Act”.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Ms Ng’s submissions that the plaintiff must reasonably have been expected to acquire knowledge of Weida Development long before 14 September 2019 (three years before the present application was filed).</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_24-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the plaintiff could have asked Mr Wu Gang, the site supervisor, or Mr Xue, whom he alleges to be his supervisor at the Worksite, about any other parties involved in the accident.

The plaintiff asserts, without explanation, that O 20 r 5(3) applies because this application is “more akin to amending the name of a party, even though the effect was to substitute a new party”.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counsel for Weida Development, Ms Ng, makes two arguments:</a></p><a id="p1_31"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_31-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, she argues that because the Notice of Discontinuance had already been filed, O 20 r 5(3) cannot apply because there is no basis for amending the name of Weida Engineering when the proceedings against it have already discontinued.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a> In oral submissions, Ms Ng contended that this was therefore not an application for <em>substitution</em> of a party, but <em>addition</em> of a party.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, she claims that O 20 r 5(3) of the ROC 2014 is meant to apply to the situation where “what is sought is a mere correction of nomenclature”.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a> She cites the case of <em>Thu Aung Zaw v Ku Swee Boon (trading as Norb Creative Studio)</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22295-SSP.xml')">[2018] 4 SLR 1260</a> (“<em>Thu Aung Zaw</em>”). This was an appeal against a District Court’s decision to allow the amendment of the name of the summary judgment creditor in the summary judgment. The High Court, in dismissing the appeal, found that the amendment fell within O 20 r 5(3) because the summary judgment creditor had made a genuine mistake in suing under the name of his sole proprietorship, instead of his name personally, and the summary judgment debtor was never misled by this. Weida Development argued that the present case can be distinguished because the plaintiff’s application goes beyond a mere change in nomenclature. Weida Engineering and Weida Development are two separate entities with different UEN numbers and different directors. In oral submissions, Ms Ng stated that corrections to nomenclature would mean, for example, typographical errors to the name of the defendant.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will deal with the second argument first. In my view, this argument cannot be accepted because it is an unduly restrictive reading of O 20 r 5(3). It ignores the fact that the provision specifically provides that there can be the correction of the name of a party “notwithstanding that it is alleged that the effect of the amendment will be to <em>substitute a new party</em>” [emphasis added]. If only changes to nomenclature or typographical errors could be considered corrections, this would render the phrase otiose. I note that even in <em>Thu Aung Zaw</em> itself, the amendment was not just a correction of nomenclature or typographical error, but a substantive change from a sole proprietorship to the name of the sole proprietor.</a></p><a id="p1_32"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first argument is an interesting one. As far as I am aware, this issue has not been dealt with directly in the local case law. The argument is intuitively attractive – logically, if the suit against Weida Engineering had already been discontinued, there is nothing left to “correct”. However, on closer analysis, this argument cannot be correct.</a></p><a id="p1_33"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To explain this, it is useful to consider the High Court decision in <em>Lee Bee Eng (formerly trading as AFCO East Development) v Cheng William</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25904-SSP.xml')">[2021] 3 SLR 968</a> (“<em>Lee Bee Eng</em>”). In that case, the plaintiff was the sole proprietor of AFCO East Development (“the Sole Proprietorship”). The Sole Proprietorship was later incorporated as a private limited company, AFCO East Development Pte Ltd (“the Company”). The suit was initially brought in the name of the Company. The defendant’s main argument was that the Company had no standing to bring the suit, as the contract in question was between the Sole Proprietorship and himself, not the Company. The defendant filed a summons to strike out the claim of the Company and seek security for costs. In response, the Company filed an application to have the sole proprietor added as a plaintiff. Both summonses were heard before the Assistant Registrar (“the AR”), who ordered that the sole proprietor be added as a plaintiff, and the Company and its claims against the defendant be struck out.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendant appealed. On appeal, the defendant argued the AR did not have the power to add the sole proprietor as proceedings had already concluded when the Company and its claims were struck out. He contended that the power to order joinders only existed when there remained “something to be done” in the matter, but there was nothing left to be done after the striking out. Accordingly, the AR’s power of joinder no longer existed (<em>Lee Bee Eng</em> at [16]).</a></p><a id="p1_35"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee Seiu Kin J rejected this argument and found that the AR’s power of joinder was not extinguished by the order to strike out the Company and its claims (at [35]). Two of the reasons for this is relevant to the present application.</a></p><a id="p1_36"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Lee J held that the provision on joinder was to be read “with a view towards saving and enabling rather than destroying and disabling.” In particular, he stated that “[a]t its heart, adding another party to the action was the <em>final step in the broader effort to substitute [the Company] with [the sole proprietor] as the proper plaintiff</em>” [emphasis added] (at [36]).</a></p><a id="p1_37"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Lee J found that adopting the defendant’s argument would lead to an absurd result. He explained this as follows (at [38]):</a></p><a id="p1_38"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Taking her argument to its logical extension, the defendant would have had no cause for complaint if the AR had simply added Ms Lee to the action <em>before</em> striking out AFCO as a party. Indeed, this was exactly Mr Sia’s defence – the AR had added Ms Lee to the action while AFCO was still a party to the proceedings. The power of joinder therefore subsisted at the time of its exercise. Though its simplicity is attractive, this series of arguments cannot be accepted. <b>The court’s power of joinder should not depend on whether striking out was done before or after the party addition. The availability of this power should abide by the provision’s core principle – to save rather than destroy.</b></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in italics in original; emphasis added in bold]</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although <em>Lee Bee Eng</em> was in the context of joinder under O 15 r 6 ROC 2014, I find that the principles are equally applicable in the present context under O 20 r 5(3).</a></p><a id="p1_39"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a><a id="p1_40">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reason at [37] above relates to the <em>purpose</em> of the provision and the <em>substance</em> of the application for joinder. In the present context, the purpose of allowing amendments, even after the limitation period has expired, is for the correct parties to be part of the proceedings, so that the real questions in controversy between the correct parties can be determined (see <em>Lim Yong Swan</em> at [15], citing <em>The Virginia Rhea</em> [1983-1984] SLR(R) 639 at [5]).</a></p><a id="p1_40"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a><a id="p1_41">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, it is evident from the procedural history set out in [7] above that what the plaintiff’s solicitors had attempted to do from 4 May 2021 (when they filed MC/SUM 2146/2021, the first summons for amendment) to date is to add Weida <em>Development</em> as the correct party to the suit. Unfortunately, there were multiple lapses which resulted in errors made in the process, with the wrong defendant, Weida <em>Engineering</em>, added to the proceedings. Eventually, the plaintiff’s solicitors took the step of first filing a Notice of Discontinuance against Weida Engineering, before filing the present summons to add Weida Development. They could have filed a single application to remove the mis-joined party, Weida Engineering, and add the correct party, Weida Development. For reasons not made known to the Court, they did not do so but chose a more circuitous route.</a></p><a id="p1_41"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a><a id="p1_42">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Ms Ng that <em>viewed on its own</em>, the present application is to <em>add</em> Weida Development as a party to the suit. But that is not the end of it. Viewed in the context of the procedural history, <em>at its heart</em>, the present summons to add Weida Development to the action was the “final step in the broader effort” to <em>correct</em> the wrongly added Weida Engineering and substitute the proper defendant, Weida Development (<em>Lee Bee Eng</em> at [36]). This is so that the correct parties to the action can be added to enable all issues to be ventilated at the same forum.</a></p><a id="p1_42"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a><a id="p1_43">43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason in <em>Lee Bee Eng</em> (set out at [38] above) is equally applicable by analogy to the present case and follows from the analysis above. Weida Development’s argument leads to the absurd result that if the plaintiff’s solicitors had applied in the usual way for directly to remove the mis-joined party, Weida Engineering, and add the correct party, Weida Development, in the same sitting, the plaintiff would presumably have no cause for complaint. But the fact that in the present case, the Notice of Discontinuance was filed against Weida Engineering, <em>before</em>, rather than <em>at the same time as</em>, the present summons to add Weida Development cannot be the sole reason for why O 20 r 5(3) does not apply. Indeed, I am fortified in my view by the High Court’s observation in <em>Lee Bee Eng</em> at [31] that the same result on the facts of that case could have been achieved by invoking O 20 r 5(3) of the ROC 2014.</a></p><a id="p1_43"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a><a id="p1_44">44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore find that the present case is, at its heart a correction of the name of a party that falls within O 20 r 5(3) ROC 2014. It can therefore be distinguished from cases concerned purely with the addition of new parties, such as the following cases in which the exception in O 20 r 5(3) would not apply:</a></p><a id="p1_44"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44"></a><a id="p1_44-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Mer Vue</em>, the appellant was the management corporation of a condominium, which sought to bring proceedings against the developer for building defects.

After the expiry of the limitation period, the appellant wanted to amend the F&amp;BPs to add 113 further subsidiary proprietors. The Court of Appeal found that the amendment sought constituted an <em>addition</em> of 113 subsidiary proprietors, who were substantive parties to the action (at [19] and [23]), and disallowed the amendment.</a></p><a id="p1_44-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_44-p2_a_1">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Abdul Gaffer bin Fathil v Chua Kwang Yong</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1994] 3 SLR(R) 1056.xml')">[1994] 3 SLR(R) 1056</a>, the respondent suffered injuries in a road traffic accident while driving his employer’s vehicle.

Judgment in Default of Appearance was entered against the appellant, but the appellant applied to set aside the default judgment on the ground that the claim against him was time barred at the time he was joined as a defendant.

This first was in the Defence filed by the first and second defendant on 3 November 2020. The second was a reminder from Ms Chee in the 9 March 2021 Email, stating the same and asking for confirmation whether Weida <em>Development</em> would be added as a defendant. MC/SUM 2146/2021, filed on 4 May 2021, was evidently in response to these two notices. Unfortunately, the draft amended Writ of Summons and Statement of Claim attached to the summons reflected Weida <em>Engineering</em>, with its UEN number, as the third defendant to be added. The fact this was a genuine mistake is perhaps most evident at paragraphs 7 to 9 of the supporting affidavit of the plaintiff’s solicitor, Ms Seetha Lkshmi P.S.

The cover letter was addressed to “Weida <b><em>Development</em></b> Pte Ltd”, as well as its auditor. In the cover letter, the plaintiff’s solicitors referred to its earlier service of the amended pleadings on 27 May 2021, noted that no Memorandum of Appearance had been entered yet, and gave notice that if they did not hear from Weida Development by 22 June 2021, they would be proceeding to file interlocutory judgement against “M/s Weida <em>Development</em> Pte Ltd”. <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, on 15 July 2021, the Judgment was obtained against Weida Engineering, the plaintiff’s solicitors served the Judgment, purportedly on Weida Development.

Mr Nagarajah stated during oral submissions that there was no reasonable doubt caused that Weida Development was the proper defendant. He pointed to the involvement of Mr Wu Bing, the director of Weida Development, as set out in various documents connected with the construction project at the Worksite.</a></p><a id="p1_51"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a><a id="p1_52">52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Ng’s argument is, however, that Mr Wu Bing was misled into thinking that Weida Development was not the party sued, because the name stated in the court papers served was Weida <em>Engineering</em>. Mr Wu Bing had therefore assumed, legitimately and reasonably, that the plaintiff’s solicitors were sending correspondence to Weida Development which was in fact meant for Weida Engineering. The only step he took was therefore to inform Mr Wang Shunguo, the director of Weida Engineering, about the court documents.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53">53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fulfil the second condition, there must already be asserted in the pleadings a set of allegations which reasonably identify the party being sued, and it is merely a matter of correction to “make explicit what is implicit” (<em>Lim Yong Swan</em> at [19]).</a></p><a id="p1_53"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a><a id="p1_54">54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having considered the circumstances of the case, I find that “in truth and in substance” (see <em>Lim Yong Swan</em> at [16]), Weida Development had been under no illusions as to who the actual defendant ought to be, even though the wrong defendant was initially named.</a></p><a id="p1_54"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a><a id="p1_55">55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Statement of Claim was clear that the worksite at which the accident happened was “Yishun Street 44, Contingency works – Contract No. D/453/17”. This was stated to be, among other things, the third defendant’s premises which it controlled. It further contained details that the third defendant was negligent and breached its duty owed to the plaintiff as employers and/or those in control and management of the worksite.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a> Weida Development would clearly have known that it had supplied labour, including Mr Wu Gang and Mr Xue, to the very premises where the accident took place.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56">56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, based on the evidence before me, Mr Wu Bing could not have been unaware of Weida Development’s involvement in the accident:</a></p><a id="p1_56"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56"></a><a id="p1_56-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Mr Wu Bing signed off on the contract involving a sub-contractor, M/s Teck Hwee Construction Pte Ltd, for the Worksite. The contract was stated to be prepared (among others) by Mr Wu Gang, the site manager of Weida Development.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a> Mr Wu Bing also signed off as director on the “Impact/Risk Assessment Form” dated 1 August 2018 in relation to the Worksite. Mr Wu Gang signed off as site manager, while Mr Xue signed off as “Rebar supervisor”. Among other things, the risk assessment form involved the identification of hazards during formwork dismantling, such as falling from height, and the proper risk control measures that should be taken.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Mr Wu Bing stated that after the accident, he “personally had many discussions with the director of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, [Mr Lu]”. He also forwarded an incident report prepared by the second defendant to Mr Lu as he wanted to discuss the accident with Mr Lu.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, at least two letters in respect of the proceedings, containing court documents, were addressed to Weida Development and one even to Mr Wu Bing personally (see [49] above). Ms Ng pointed out during oral submissions that based on ACRA records, Weida Development had moved out of the Oxley Bizhub address by the time of service of the letters, to the Hougang address. However, I note that (i) Weida Development still had a site office at Oxley Bizhub and (ii) in any event, it appeared that the 15 July 2021 letter could have been posted to the Hougang address (see [49(c)] and Footnote 28 above). In the circumstances, I find it unreasonable for Mr Wu Bing to turn a blind eye towards the entire sequence of events, and simply assume that the accident at <em>that particular worksite</em> involving <em>this particular plaintiff</em> on <em>that particular date</em>, could have been meant for Weida Engineering (which had nothing to do with the accident). He should at least have made enquiries on the letters with the plaintiff’s solicitors.</a></p><a id="p1_56-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_57">57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the foregoing, there could not have been any reasonable doubt as to the identity of Weida Development as the correct defendant from the very beginning. Adding Weida Development is simply the last step in an unnecessarily arduous process to make explicit what has always been implicit.</a></p><a id="p1_57"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Is it just to allow the amendment? </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a><a id="p1_58">58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I consider whether it is just to allow the amendments in all the circumstances. The plaintiff asserts that Weida Development is an essential party to the plaintiff’s action and that it would be in the interest of justice for it to be added and/or substituted as a defendant in this action.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a> Weida Development does not expressly address this point.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59">59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It cannot seriously be disputed that allowing the amendment to add Weida Development as a defendant is necessary to complete the process of substituting the correct party into the proceedings. This would ensure that the plaintiff would be able to pursue his claim against the proper parties, such that all matters relating to the plaintiff’s claim can be effectively ventilated at the same forum, and effectually and completely determined. I thus find that it is in the interest of justice to allow the amendment.</a></p><a id="p1_59"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a><a id="p1_60">60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so deciding, I am cognisant that the prejudice to Weida Development lay mainly in the late stage in which the application was brought – more than three and a half years after the accident. However, I am of the view that any prejudice caused by the delay can be compensated by way of costs, which I will hear parties on.</a></p><a id="p1_60"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a><a id="p1_61">61&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I am satisfied that justice lies in favour of allowing the amendment so that the real questions in controversy between the correct parties can be determined in a single forum. From the beginning, the plaintiff made a genuine mistake by adding the wrong party, and there could have been no reasonable doubt that Weida Development was the correct defendant intended to be sued. The plaintiff’s application to add it as defendant is the final step in a broader effort to correct the wrongly added party and replace it with the proper defendant.</a></p><a id="p1_61"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a><a id="p1_62">62&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore make the following orders:</a></p><a id="p1_62"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_62"></a><a id="p1_62-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave is granted to the plaintiff to amend the Writ of Summons (Amendment No. 1) and Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1) to include Weida Development as a defendant to these proceedings as shown in the draft Writ of Summons (Amendment No 2) and Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) attached to the summons, without prejudice to any defences that the Weida Development may raise;</a></p><a id="p1_62-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_62-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_62-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff is to serve the Writ of Summons (Amendment No. 2) and Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 2) to all defendants (including Weida Development) within 14 days from the date of the Court order;</a></p><a id="p1_62-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_62-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_62-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first and second defendants are given leave to amend the Defence (Amendment No 1) and file and serve an amended Defence (Amendment No 2), if any, on the plaintiff within 14 days after the service of the amended Writ of Summons (Amendment No 2) and Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2);</a></p><a id="p1_62-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_62-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_62-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weida Development is to file and serve the Defence, if any, on the plaintiff within 14 days after the service of the amended Writ of Summons (Amendment No 2) and Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2); and</a></p><a id="p1_62-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_62-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_62-p2_e">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff is to file a Reply, if any,&nbsp;within 14 days thereafter.</a></p><a id="p1_62-p2_e"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62-p2_e"></a><a id="p1_63">63&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now hear parties on costs.</a></p><a id="p1_63"> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"></a><p class="Footnote"><a id="p1_63"><sup></sup></a><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a>Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) at paras 1-4; Defence (Amendment No 1) at para 3.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>Defence (Amendment No 1) at para 4; Skeletal submissions of the plaintiff dated 27 January 2023 at p 3 para 2.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) at para 6.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) at pp 9-12.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_5_1" id="Ftn_5">[note: 5]</a></sup>Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) at paras 9-13.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_6_1" id="Ftn_6">[note: 6]</a></sup>Defence at para 3.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_7_1" id="Ftn_7">[note: 7]</a></sup>Affidavit of of Seetha Lkshmi P.S.
