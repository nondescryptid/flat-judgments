Consider a young man with a life ahead of him, and dreams to boot. He was (and still is) young. He has (perhaps complacently) never taken concrete steps to pursue those dreams – not at least, any that would produce credible documentation of the sort one would expect in a court of law. One horrific accident later, he finds himself with multiple fractures, massive scars, and one kidney short. His dreams are dashed. His life now is a series of compromises he makes with a new, dimmer reality. Undoubtedly, he has lost something intangible. But he cannot articulate that loss in the law’s language, much less provide evidence of the sort that the law may demand. How does the law provide a remedy, if at all? How would the loss of a dream be priced, if priced at all?</a></p><a id="p1_1"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These would be the sort of questions implicated in an inquiry for a young plaintiff’s loss of earning capacity. The law in that regard, proved to be somewhat unclear – what is the legal test to be used when determining a young plaintiff’s loss of earning capacity? And beyond that, it was uncertain what was the correct quantification <em>methodology</em> to use in a claim for loss of earning capacity as well. Having had the opportunity to survey the authorities, I offer a modest rationalisation of the law and give my reasons below.</a></p><a id="p1_2"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff, a polytechnic student at the time, was involved in a car accident on 28 September 2015.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a> There were multiple, horrific injuries requiring extensive surgical intervention.

A Memorandum of Agreement was filed by the parties on 24 September 2023.

For example, the Courts have frequently referred to the <em>Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases</em> (Academy Publishing, 2010) (“<b>the </b><b><em>Guidelines</em></b>”) as a starting point when assessing the proper quantum of damages to be awarded. But the <em>Guidelines</em> are outdated, being more than a decade old. The same goes for certain case authorities, some dating back to the 1990s.

All injuries sustained by the claimant are considered holistically to determine whether the aggregate award is reasonable and neither excessive nor inadequate: <em>Lua Bee Kiang</em> at [16]. This exercise is guided by at least two considerations. One is to avoid overcompensation, with the Court taking into account any “overlapping” injuries that either (i) together resulted in pain that would not have been differentially felt by the claimant or (ii) together gave rise to only a single disability: <em>Lua Bee Kiang</em> at [17].

The retroperitoneal space houses organs like the kidney and the ureter, and it is unsurprising to see such devastating trauma to the kidney be accompanied by injuries to the areas surrounding the kidney. Indeed, Dr Raj Kumar Menon (“<b>Dr Menon</b>”)’s report referred to the haematoma in the same breath as the kidney injuries, describing the retroperitoneal haematoma as being part of the “severe injuries to his liver and right kidney and active bleeding and clot formation”.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a> So understood, the haematoma is intrinsically tied to the other kidney-related injuries.

The kidney-related injuries required dialysis. The haematoma required laparotomies. They should be treated differently, and a separate award should be given for each, so went the argument. But Mr Tan forgets that all these procedures (separate as they may be), were in relation to injuries to the same part of the body. They relate to the kidney, the loss of function in the kidney, and the associated trauma to the areas surrounding the kidney. These injuries may have been treated with different procedures (as medical necessity required), but were still fundamentally linked. In any case, the Defendant’s counsel, Mr Narayanan Ramasamy (“<b>Mr Ramasamy</b>”), made the point that the laparotomy was <em>not</em> for the haematoma alone. A laparotomy is a surgical incision to reach the internal organs and would conceivably have been part of the broader surgical procedure to treat (amongst other things) the kidney too. This means that there was <em>no separate treatment procedure</em> for the haematoma <em>alone</em>.

On that authority, the Defendant invited me to award a similar quantum of damages. I decline that invitation. There was a marked difference in severity between the injuries in <em>Woon Yok M</em>oy and the present case. Just looking at the kidney-related injuries, <em>Woon Yok May</em> only involved a retroperitoneal haematoma (and no information was given about the size or severity of the haematoma in the Practitioner’s Library). The present case involves a <em>large</em> retroperitoneal haematoma, and a shattered kidney that had to be removed. It is just not clear whether <em>Woon Yok Moy</em> involved sufficiently analogous facts.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant’s second argument concerned the Plaintiff’s efforts to go for yearly review of the kidney injuries.

So understood, it seems that there was a complex cocktail of reasons why the Plaintiff did not pursue medical reviews with more diligence.

Accepting that the liver lacerations here were not as severe as the liver damage in that case, Mr Tan proposed $100,000 – about “half”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a> of what the <em>Andrea De Cruz</em> award would be valued at by today’s standards. Neither Mr Ramasamy’s nor Mr Tan’s proposals are persuasive. $10,000 appears to be too low a sum. The present case involved a complex liver laceration with serious blood loss resulting. A mere $4,000 uplift from <em>Woon Yok Moy</em>’s $6,000 award would be too little, especially considering that <em>Woon Yok Moy</em> involved nothing more than a liver contusion which did not require extensive/separate treatment (see <em>Practitioner</em>’s <em>Library</em> at p 507). But equally, $100,000 seems excessive. No explanation was given for why “half” of the <em>Andrea De Cruz</em> award would be fair. This appears to be a largely impressionistic submission on Mr Tan’s part. It fails to account for the fact that the liver had largely recovered. Dr Glenn Bonney (“<b>Dr Bonney</b>”), the only hepatobiliary surgeon to tender a specialist report, stated that the plaintiff “should [not] have any ill effect to his liver as a result of this injury”, observing that the plaintiff had “normal liver function on blood tests” and a “normal ultrasound scan doppler of this liver”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> The damages for a liver with no residual disabilities simply cannot be compared to that awarded for a total failure of the liver, much less be estimated at half of the latter.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The authorities being unsatisfactory (and I should add that my own consultation of the <em>Practitioner’s Library</em> proved to be fruitless), and the submissions being unpersuasive, I take a practical approach to determining the appropriate damage for the liver lacerations. The award has to be between $10,000 and $100,000 (at least, based on my reasoning above at [24]). The award also has to be lower than $87,000, since the liver lacerations were objectively less severe than the kidney injuries. All in, given the severity of the injuries, the invasiveness of the surgical procedures, but also the full recovery of the liver and the absence of any residual disabilities, I find that $20,000 would be a fair sum to award. I should add that there is no need to account for inflation in this award, as this is not an award rationalised from old precedents/authorities, but deduced from the facts of this case itself.</a></p><a id="p1_25"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Diaphragmatic injury on the right hemi-diaphragm and right vocal cord paresis</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Kumar identified a diaphragmatic injury on the right hemi-diaphragm in his report.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a> Both parties agreed that $10,000 was a fair sum to award for this injury.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> I accept this joint proposal.

There were some residual disabilities in the form of reduced range of motions in the wrist. But none of this resulted in a “great loss of function” (<em>Guidelines</em> at p 36F(a)). The plaintiff was, by and large, “managing daily activities well”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a> and there was simply no suggestion that he had <em>lost</em> the use of the wrist in any serious way.

Mr Tan’s justification for classifying the fractures in the highest band of severity under the <em>Guidelines</em> was that this involved multiple fractures. Only the highest band in the <em>Guidelines</em> could supposedly account for the number of fractures. This is not true. There were other bands of severity such as those at <em>Guidelines</em> pages 37F(c) or 37F(d) that were intended to address multiple (albeit less severe) fractures. The <em>Guidelines</em> at page 37F(c), for example, covers “moderate fractures of the distal radius <em>and</em>/or ulna” (emphasis mine).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were not “moderately severe fractures of the distal radius or ulna” either.

And neither could the permanent disabilities (a reduction in the right wrist’s range of motion) be said to be significant. Save for the pronation of the wrist, the other measures of a writ’s range of motion (such as dorsiflexion, palmar-flexion, ulnar deviation, radial deviation, and supination) did not have significant issues. How exactly was “significance” of the reduction in range of motion medically measured? Both Dr Ng Yau Hong (“<b>Dr Ng</b>”) and Dr James Lee Chong Hwa (“<b>Dr Lee</b>”) agreed that one viable way to assess the wrist’s range of motion was to compare the ranges of motion between the injured wrist and its non-injured counterpart.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> When the difference in ranges of motion between the two are about “10 degrees or so”, the injured wrist’s reduction in range of motion could be said to be medically significant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> As of 30 July 2020 (Dr Lee’s last examination of the plaintiff), the plaintiff’s wrist was only experiencing medically significant restrictions in pronating.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="">That said, I took the view that taken in their <em>totality</em>, the difficulties with wrist movement were not so high as to warrant placing the fractures in the “moderately severe” category. Indeed, when the <em>Guidelines</em> speaks of “significant” permanent disability in relation to wrist injuries, it appears to be distinguishing the various bands of severity by how much <em>functionality</em> of the wrist has been compromised. Hence, “severe” injuries are described as involving “<em>great</em> loss of function”; “moderately severe” injuries, as “<em>considerable</em> loss of function”; and “moderate” injuries as those where the plaintiff is “<em>able to regain</em> substantial function of his wrist”.

True also, is that the fractures there were “surgically fixed with metal plate”, similar to the treatment given in the present case. Moreover, the plaintiff in <em>Balbir</em> was “unlikely to suffer permanent disability or osteoarthritis”, suggesting that <em>Balbir</em> was a case with far less severe injuries than the present case. And yet, the plaintiff in <em>Balbir</em> was awarded some $18,000 for these upper limb fractures. To me, this seemed odd and disproportionate. $18,000 – $18,000 by 1996 standards no less – is an incredible amount of money and at odds with the ordinary range of damages described in the <em>Guidelines</em>. <em>Balbir</em>’s award therefore has to be rationalised in one of two ways: either (a) the <em>Practitioner’s Library</em> did not contain sufficient details about the case – perhaps the fractures were excruciating and horrific, necessitating a highly invasive (possibly dangerous) surgery which warranted higher damages; or (b) the decision was simply an outlier that did not follow the general trends compiled in the <em>Guidelines</em>. If it is the former, I am simply unable to use <em>Balbir</em> meaningfully since the facts of that case are not before me.

I do not think there is a straightforward relationship between how often someone goes to seek treatment, and how severe the PTSD is. There might be good reasons why somebody does not pursue follow-up treatment for his PTSD.

id="p1_57">57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scars speak for themselves. There were twenty scars, spread across the Plaintiff’s body ranging in length from 1cm to 30cm. Significantly, Dr Jane Lim (“<b>Dr Jane</b>”), the plastic surgeon who attended to the Plaintiff, stated that the scars are rated to be “25% of whole-body impairment”.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_109" id="Ftn_109_1"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a> There was no doubt in my mind that this was an injury which warranted $14,000 of damages, the higher end of the range stated in the <em>Guidelines</em> at p 57A(a). And separate from the number and size of the scars, the lower limb scars are “prominent”. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_110" id="Ftn_110_1"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58">58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I am fully aware that there was no invasive surgical procedure used to manage the scars in the present case. Cases such as <em>Valuina v Lim Chee Beng</em> (Unreported; DC Suit No. 374 of 2007 (“<b><em>Valuina</em></b>”) cited in the <em>Practitioner’s Library</em> at p 852) and <em>Nick Loh Sze Chiang (formerly known as Loh Ziqiang (Luo Ziqiang)) v Poa Hui Shan, Ivy (A minor)</em> (Unreported; Suit No. 189 of 2013 (“<b><em>Nick Loh</em></b>”) cited in the <em>Practitioner’s Library</em> at p 905) made awards of $15,000 and $12,000 for multiple scars, some of which required skin-grafting. Notwithstanding that the present case did not involve any invasive surgical intervention, I am prepared to award $14,000 for these scars, if only because the <em>extent</em> of body impairment is high (25% whole-body impairment). And it does not appear that the Plaintiff can have some of these scars surgically treated either. Dr Jane clarified that, at least for the lower limb scars, the surgical risks far outweigh the benefits.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_111" id="Ftn_111_1"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a> In my view, these factors put the present case in the same bracket as precedents like <em>Valuina</em> and <em>Nick Loh</em>, but for different reasons.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59">59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fairness to Mr Ramasamy, he candidly revised his initial submission of $8,000 to $10,000 when I raised these factors to him at the hearing. He justified his proposal with two arguments, but I am unable to accept either of them.</a></p><a id="p1_59"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59"></a><a id="p1_59-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first argument was that “the scars are minor”, there being “no specific evidence about the scars being itchy or unsightly”.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_112" id="Ftn_112_1"><sup>[note: 112]</sup></a> The scars are not minor. The laparotomy scar alone is 30cm long, that being just one of the twenty scars on the Plaintiff’s body. The scars are indeed unsightly, judging by their size and location on the body.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second argument was that the cost of treating these scars had in some sense been accounted for by the future medical expenses<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_113" id="Ftn_113_1"><sup>[note: 113]</sup></a> which the Defendant had already agreed to foot.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_114" id="Ftn_114_1"><sup>[note: 114]</sup></a></span> That misses the point. Future medical expenses are an entirely separate head of claim from pain and suffering. They address different consequential losses arising from a given physical injury. If Mr Ramasamy’s suggestion was that the unsightliness (<em>ie</em> pain and suffering arising) from the scars could be remedied with “other sources of treatment”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_115" id="Ftn_115_1"><sup>[note: 115]</sup></a></span> that did not hold water either. There was simply not enough evidence as to the efficacy of these other treatment procedures, conservative or otherwise. I was not prepared to assume in the absence of further medical evidence, and drew conclusions based on what was before me – undisputed medical reports documenting extensive medical scarring across a significant portion of the body, that have not faded with time.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60">60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, on the range stated in the <em>Guidelines</em> at p 57A(a) ($5,000 - $15,000), this was an appropriate case for an award of $14,000. Adjusting for inflation, again with reference to the MAS Inflation Calculator, I award $17,000.</a></p><a id="p1_60"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Further adjustments </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a><a id="p1_61">61&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foregoing analysis completes stage one of the analysis. As alluded to earlier (see [33] above), the present case is a suitable one for an uplift at the second stage of the analysis. I apply this uplift having regard to three main factors.</a></p><a id="p1_61"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a><a id="p1_62">62&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Plaintiff was a young, 19-year-old man at the time of the accident. For those injuries which involve long-term medical disabilities/consequences, the Plaintiff will necessarily live with them for longer, and his suffering will accordingly be greater. These include:</a></p><a id="p1_62"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_62"></a><a id="p1_62-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The constant monitoring and lifestyle adjustments that the Plaintiff will have to make for his kidney-related injuries (see [19] above);</a></p><a id="p1_62-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_62-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_62-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The constant pain experience in the right wrist from the surgical implants (see [41(c)] above), the continued risk of implants giving rise to complications (see [43] above), and the permanent restriction in range of motion in his wrists (see [41(b)] above);</a></p><a id="p1_62-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_62-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_62-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The permanent restriction in range of motion in his right ankle (see [48] above); and</a></p><a id="p1_62-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_62-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_62-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unsightliness of the multiple scars on his body, and in particular on his right lower limb (see [57] above).</a></p><a id="p1_62-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62-p2_d"></a><a id="">A separate adjustment is warranted to address the longer time horizon over which the Plaintiff will experience the aforementioned disabilities/consequences.</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_63">63&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Plaintiff suffered an intestinal obstruction which (as explained above at [33]) could not be fairly captured under any <em>particular</em> head of injury. The intestinal obstruction was the result of emergency trauma surgery, and that surgery was done in relation to <em>all</em> of the abdominal injuries (the kidney, liver, and diaphragmatic injuries). It similarly could not be regarded as a <em>separate</em> injury in its own right, in that it was inextricably linked to the treatment of the same abdominal injuries. An upward adjustment was warranted for this medical complication, especially considering that the Plaintiff had to be re-admitted to treat the intestinal obstruction, and spent three days in the wards before being discharged (see [33] above)</a></p><a id="p1_63"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a><a id="p1_64">64&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, and in opposition to the two points mentioned above, all the abdominal injuries necessarily had to be treated at the same time, at least when the patient first presented at the hospital. The internal organs were accessed by the same procedure (a laparotomy), and one could expect that there was some amount of overlap in the pain and suffering (at least between the various abdominal injuries) during the initial surgery. Follow-up procedures (such as the abdominal washout and change of vacuum dressings) were also related to multiple heads of injuries (<em>ie</em> the abdominal injuries). Again, the pain and suffering experienced by the Plaintiff could be said to have been shared between these heads of injuries. This merited a downward adjustment to prevent overcompensation.</a></p><a id="p1_64"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a><a id="p1_65">65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taken in their totality, I find that a moderate uplift of $10,000 would best balance the three competing considerations above. For completeness, I have also considered the precedents cited by parties (primarily those that were discussed above at stage one of the analysis ([12] – [60])) and none of the authorities suggest to me that the aggregate award here is either excessive or inadequate (see <em>Lua Bee Kiang</em> at [18]).</a></p><a id="p1_65"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Loss of Earning Capacity </p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Clarifying the precise nature of the Plaintiff’s claim </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a><a id="p1_66">66&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before embarking on the analysis proper, I make three observations about the Plaintiff’s claim for loss of earning capacity.</a></p><a id="p1_66"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66"></a><a id="p1_66-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a claim for <em>loss of earning capacity</em>, not loss of future earnings.

Though the parties did not make any explicit distinction between the two, the tenor of their submissions (both oral and written) appear to address <em>post-trial</em> loss of earning capacity. In any case, our Courts do <em>not</em> recognise claims for pre-trial loss of earning capacity (<em>Yap Boon Fong Yvonne v Wong Kok Mun Alvin and another and another appeal</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22455-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGCA 80</a> (“<b><em>Yvonne Yap</em></b>”) at [42]). I can only assume that the Plaintiff is fully aware of this since he was the one that brought <em>Yvonne Yap</em> to my attention.

He is saying that his ambitions have been dashed and with that, an alternate future has been snatched from him. But that sort of claim – an identifiably different head of loss – would have to be analysed in a completely different way. One would have to scrutinise whether the Defendant’s breach (on a balance of probabilities) <em>caused</em> the loss of a chance to become a pilot/soldier: <em>Tembusu Growth Fund Ltd v ACTAtek, Inc and others</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22293-SSP.xml')">[2018] 4 SLR 1213</a> (“<b><em>Tembusu Growth</em></b>”) at [127]. Following that, the court would have to assess whether the chance lost was “real or substantial” (<em>Tembusu Growth</em> at [128]). Only then, could the Court be satisfied of the loss of chance and grant something as compensation. This, unfortunately, was <em>not</em> the Plaintiff’s pleaded case. Likewise, saying that the Plaintiff’s graduation was delayed does not, in itself, suggest a loss of the sort compensable under a claim for LEC. If anything, it seems to be a quibble with the lost year of income. That, as Mr Ramasamy rightly pointed out in his submissions, was already compensated for in the agreed claim for pre-trial loss of earnings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_123" id="Ftn_123_1"><sup>[note: 123]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69">69&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But consider this. The Plaintiff will almost certainly never be able to take up jobs requiring great physical labour. He will not be able to participate in industries or occupations that call on the strength of his legs and the stamina of his body. And one of those occupations may <em>well</em> be a job as a soldier or as a pilot. His loss, if framed <em>not as a loss of opportunity</em> (to secure a better paying job), but <em>as a reduction in the range of jobs available</em> to him, sounds exactly like the sort of competitive disadvantage described above at [67(c)]. Consider also, the true effect of a delayed graduation. It goes beyond just lost income. It represents lost workplace experience too. The Plaintiff, by virtue of starting work one year later, has one less year of workplace experience than he otherwise would have had. This necessarily has implications for his employability and employment prospects – again the sort of competitive disadvantage that a claim for LEC comfortably addresses. Framing the Plaintiff’s losses in this manner would be a complete answer to the Defendant’s quibble with the <em>manner</em> that the Plaintiff has sought to characterise his losses.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_124" id="Ftn_124_1"><sup>[note: 124]</sup></a> And so framed, the Plaintiff’s lived experience may be mapped onto, and expressed in the language of LEC.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The applicable test when plaintiffs without incomes at the time of the accident claim for LEC </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70">70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, however, usually not enough to simply identify the competitive disadvantage that was occasioned by a defendant’s breach.

Only then, would the Court be able to assess and quantify the “present value of the risk of the <em>financial damage</em> which the plaintiff will suffer <em>if that risk materialises</em>” (<em>Samuel Chai</em> at [36], citing <em>Moeliker</em> at 17; emphasis mine).</a></p><a id="p1_71"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a><a id="p1_72">72&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, for plaintiffs who remain employed in their pre-accident job after the accident, they are called to prove that there is a “substantial or real risk” that they will lose this pre-accident job (<em>Samuel Chai</em> at [36]); only then would such plaintiffs be thrust into the open labour market, and only then would any weakening of their competitive position in that market occasion financial damage to him: <em>Rakibul</em> at [74]. Put another way, these plaintiffs are <em>protected</em> from the risk of financial damage because of their employment status at the time of the assessment: <em>Smith</em> at 8. Taking this “protection” into account, the Court requires that plaintiffs prove that there is an <em>actual</em> risk of the competitive disadvantage manifesting as financial damage <em>ie</em> a real risk that the plaintiff might lose his pre-accident job.</a></p><a id="p1_72"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a><a id="p1_73">73&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other plaintiffs, however, do <em>not</em> have the benefit of such protection. They are either already in the open labour market or have taken up lower paying jobs by the time of assessment. For these plaintiffs, it would make no sense for the law to insist that they prove that there is a risk of losing their pre-accident job – they have <em>already</em> lost it, or have <em>none</em> to lose. And more importantly, the Court need not account for anything that protects them from the financial damage of being prevented from competing for their pre-accident job (see <em>Rakibul</em> at [78] and [85]). Accordingly (and unsurprisingly), the legal test applicable to such plaintiffs is much more straightforward. The two-step approach in <em>Samuel Chai</em> does not apply. There is no need for the first step of proving a real risk that the plaintiff would lose their pre-accident job in the future. For plaintiffs who take up a less well-paying job <em>post-accident</em>, they need only show that they had been prevented from competing in the market for their pre-accident job: <em>Lua Bee Kiang</em> at [50]. And where a given plaintiff is unemployed at the time of assessment, all that remains is for a court to evaluate “whether there is a real risk that the plaintiff will be at a disadvantage in the open employment market because of the injury sustained in the accident”: <em>Pamela Jane</em> at [139]. Proof of these, presumably, demonstrates that the plaintiff would suffer a competitive disadvantage that would thereby occasion financial damage to him.</a></p><a id="p1_73"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a><a id="p1_74">74&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn then to the situations “where there is no available evidence of the plaintiff’s earnings to enable the court to properly calculate future earnings.”: <em>Teo Sing Keng and another v Sim Ban Kiat</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1994] 1 SLR(R) 0340.xml')">[1994] 1 SLR(R) 340</a> (“<b><em>Teo Sing Keng</em></b>”) at [40(b)]. Typically, these are young plaintiffs like the ones in <em>Quek Yen Fei (CA)</em> or <em>Fadhil</em>; students, like the plaintiff in <em>Michael Clark</em>; or perhaps a mix of both, like the plaintiffs in <em>Ilyas</em> or <em>Eugene Lim</em>. Whatever form they take, these plaintiffs tend to have “no earnings on which to base an assessment for loss of future earnings”: <em>Teo Sing Keng</em> at [40(b)]. In practice, the law has always accepted that such plaintiffs are, in principle, candidates for an LEC award, even as it regarded them as a perhaps special category of plaintiffs where LEC is concerned.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75">75&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, candidacy for LEC damages does not mean entitlement to the same. For these plaintiffs, there may be no way to arithmetically estimate a proper award for loss of future earnings (“<b>LFE</b>”). But as <em>Samuel Chai</em> cautioned at [20], “lack of sufficient evidence proving loss of future earnings […] cannot, by itself, <em>convert</em> a claim for loss of future earnings into a claim for loss of earning capacity [and] failure to prove loss of future earnings [should not] lead to an <b><em>award</em></b> for loss of earning capacity” (emphasis in bold italics, mine; see also <em>Samuel Chai</em> at [22]). Entitlement to an LEC award must still be proven independently.</a></p><a id="p1_75"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a><a id="p1_76">76&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, there does not appear to have been any clearly articulated test for determining that entitlement. Having surveyed the authorities, I would offer the following as my best rationalisation of the law as it stands.</a></p><a id="p1_76"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a><a id="p1_77">77&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, when the plaintiff has <em>not</em> commenced work at the time of assessment of damages, he would neither be protected from financial damage for the time being (<em>ala Samuel Chai</em>’s plaintiff), nor would he necessarily be exposed to the vagaries of the open labour market just yet (<em>ala Pamela Jane</em>’s plaintiff). In such situations, the approach seems to just involve a general inquiry into whether the plaintiff’s “employability”/ “employment prospects”/ “future job prospects” have been diminished: <em>Winston Tan</em> at [38] – [40], and <em>Ilyas</em> at [37]. There is no need to account for the possibility that financial damage might be averted, or the possibility that he might otherwise be protected from the financial damage occasioned by his competitive disadvantage. The plaintiff has been handicapped before he even enters the labour market. And when he starts looking for a job – as he most certainly will at some point – he will <em>indubitably</em> experience that competitive disadvantage. It is only a matter of time before financial damage is occasioned from the competitive disadvantage.</a></p><a id="p1_77"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a><a id="p1_78">78&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, when the plaintiff <em>has</em> commenced work at the time of assessment of damages, there may be multiple bases on which an LEC claim could be founded. The starting point would be whether the plaintiff was, at the time of the accident, engaged in a line of work that broadly corresponds to his pre-accident <em>potential</em>.</a></p><a id="p1_78"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_78"></a><a id="p1_78-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the plaintiff proves that, at the time of the assessment, he has been forced to work at a job <em>below</em> his pre-accident potential, then he would obviously be entitled to damages for LEC, without more. This is because there is unequivocal evidence that his competitive position has been weakened – the plaintiff is earning less than what he should be earning. And it is abundantly clear that financial damage has resulted from that weakened position. That was exactly the experience in <em>Koh Chai Kwang v Teo Ai Ling (by her next friend, Chua Wee Bee)</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 3 SLR 0610.xml')">[2011] 3 SLR 610</a> (“<b><em>Teo Ai Ling (CA)</em></b>”). The plaintiff there was a bright student, who would otherwise have passed her polytechnic course and graduated with a diploma had it not been for the accident. Her failure to obtain a diploma was entirely attributable to the cognitive injuries arising from the accident. She ended up as a data entry clerk earning $800 a month, with nothing but her ‘O’ Level qualifications. Unsurprisingly, the Court of Appeal found that the plaintiff there was entitled to an LEC award:</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, the [plaintiff in <em>Teo Ai Ling (CA)</em>], if not for the accident, would have probably completed the Diploma and started work, whether in the food business or the civil service or any other job. All she has now is her “O” level certificate. Further, there is evidence, and indeed even without such evidence common sense will also tell us, that a polytechnic graduate will command a higher wage than an “O” level holder within most occupations.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">[…]</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;… we are we are recognising that, at the <em>minimum</em>, [her] competitive position in the labour market is weakened by her failure to obtain the Diploma...</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_78-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the plaintiff is thankfully engaged in a line of work that corresponds to his pre-accident potential, the court would assess whether the plaintiff has <em>nonetheless</em> experienced some sort of weakening of his competitive position. The <em>type</em> of competitive disadvantage examined here is different from that examined under the situations described at [77] above. The disadvantage here tends to relate to the plaintiff’s work performance as someone <em>already employed</em>, as opposed to say, his attractiveness as a <em>prospective employee</em>. As such, a nursing student who successfully went on to become a nurse despite his accident, was compensated for the anticipated “difficulties in career advancement due to his whiplash-related syndromes” and the “permanent disabilities […] which can interfere with his work performance”: <em>Michael Clark</em> at [77] and [82]. And similarly, an electronic/computer engineering student who successfully went on to become a sales engineer despite his accident, was compensated for the risk that his “administrative or desk-bound job [would] require greater physical input in the future” and the risk that he could “lose the opportunity for advancement”: <em>Eugene Lim</em> at [43].</a></p><a id="p1_78-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_78-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_78-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separately, irrespective of whether the plaintiff is earning above or below his pre-accident potential, the plaintiff may well be able to claim for <em>further</em> loss of earning capacity on the basis that he will also be at a disadvantage in competing for the job he is employed in at the time of assessment, and suffer <em>further</em> financial damage as a result. “In principle, it is difficult to see why such a plaintiff should not be able to do so. Such a claim would be entirely consistent with the established premise that an award for LEC is meant to compensate an injured plaintiff for the financial damage which he will suffer in future because of any competitive disadvantage caused by his injuries. It is trite that the general aim of tortious damages is to restore the plaintiff to the position that he would have been had the accident not occurred. If the plaintiff’s injuries would cause him further financial damage because of the disadvantage he will suffer in competing for his post-accident job, there is no reason in principle to impose an absolute bar against such claims”: <em>Rakibul</em> at [88].</a></p><a id="p1_78-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_78-p2_c"></a><a id="">I should clarify that this type of claim for <em>further</em> loss of earning capacity is quite different from the sort described at [78(b)] above. Those types of claims address the continuing difficulties that the plaintiff would experience at his job, given that he is handicapped at the time of employment. This may include an inability to take on greater responsibilities at work, an inability to work at as high a level of intensity as one might otherwise have been able to, and the diminishment of career advancement prospects. They are examples of competitive disadvantage of the sort experienced by those who are disabled and <em>already employed.</em> The <em>further</em> claims for loss of earning capacity envisaged in <em>Rakibul</em> are premised on the view that the plaintiff would have more difficulty than an able-bodied person of comparable skill in seeking employment. It is the sort of competitive disadvantage experienced by those who are <em>prospective employees</em>.</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a><a id="">As such, if such a claim for <em>further</em> loss of earning capacity is brought, I would agree with the suggestion in <em>Rakibul</em> that the two-step test in <em>Samuel Chai</em> would apply. “The plaintiff must first show a real risk of losing his post-accident job such that he may have to re-enter the open labour market for such jobs in future. Otherwise, if there is no such risk, he would be protected from any further financial damage.”: <em>Rakibul</em> at [89].</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_79">79&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is clear from the foregoing, at least part of the analysis would depend on determining the sort of job that the plaintiff would have been employed in, but for the accident. This inquiry obviously engages a high level of speculation, and the speculative nature of this assessment would doubtlessly be amplified the younger the plaintiff is (see also <em>Teo Ai Ling (CA)</em> at [45]). Unsurprisingly, the authorities do not offer a neat legal test for this. But I would imagine that the inquiry is a fact-sensitive one, having regard to common-sensical factors, considered in a common-sensical way. Borrowing from how the authorities have attempted to answer this question in other contexts (<em>eg</em> in determining the appropriate multiplicand for LFE claims brought by young plaintiffs), I would suggest that the following non-exhaustive factors may be usefully considered in the assessment:</a></p><a id="p1_79"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_79"></a><a id="p1_79-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>the plaintiff’s education level at the time of the accident</b>: <em>Quek Yen Fei Kenneth v Yeo Chye Huat</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19106-SSP.xml')">[2016] 3 SLR 1106</a> (“<b><em>Quek Yen Fei (HC)</em></b>”) at [89] (secondary 3 dropout); <em>Ilyas</em> at [7] and [37] (engineering student at UC Berkeley);</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_79-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>the plaintiff’s educational trajectory had the accident not occurred</b>: <em>Teo Ai Ling (CA)</em> at [44] – [45] (would have otherwise completed polytechnic course); <em>Lai Chi Kay v Lee Kuo Shin</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1981-1982] SLR(R) 0071.xml')">[1981 – 1982] SLR(R) 71</a> (would have otherwise completed university medical course); <em>Eugene Lim</em> at [39] (would not have otherwise attended university anyway); <em>Danial Syafiq bin Mahbob v Amin Juman bin Abdul Jabbar and another (Mohammed Faizal bin Ismail, third party)</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23905-SSP.xml')">[2019] SGHC 282</a> at [57] (would have otherwise obtained a diploma in electrical engineering); <em>Lee Wei Kong (by his litigation representative Lee Swee Chit) v Ng Siok Tong</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2012] SGCA 0004.xml')">[2012] SGCA 4</a> (“<b><em>Lee Wei Kong</em></b>”) at [35] and [37] (would have otherwise graduated from junior college and had more than even chance of obtaining a university degree);</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_79-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>the plaintiff’s previous employment history</b>: <em>Quek Yen Fei (HC)</em> at [85];</a></p><a id="p1_79-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_79-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_79-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>the plaintiff’s demonstrated interest in a particular line of work</b>: <em>Eugene Lim</em> at [41]; <em>Lee Wei Kong</em> at [37]; and</a></p><a id="p1_79-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_79-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_79-p2_e">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>the presence of injuries from any prior unrelated accidents</b>: <em>Quek Yen Fei (HC)</em> at [90]</a></p><a id="p1_79-p2_e"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79-p2_e"></a><a id="p1_80">80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the principles I have stated at [67] and [70] - [79] above can be distilled as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_80"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80"></a><a id="p1_80-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weakening of a plaintiff’s competitive position in the open labour market is the lodestone of loss for any LEC claim.

The Plaintiff was training to be an engineer all along. That was what he did at the Institute of Technical Education (“<b>ITE</b>”), and also the case when he joined the “Common Engineering Program” upon enrolment at Republic Polytechnic.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_131" id="Ftn_131_1"><sup>[note: 131]</sup></a> Indeed, he graduated from ITE with a certificate in electrical engineering.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_132" id="Ftn_132_1"><sup>[note: 132]</sup></a></span> Beyond this, the Plaintiff appears to have been a largely average student prior to the accident.

It was therefore clear to me that, at least on a balance of probabilities, an average student studying to be an engineer (such as the Plaintiff), would have found employment as an engineer, accident or not.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84">84&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff’s main argument in this regard, was that he had never harboured particular ambitions to be an engineer.

I have no difficulties accepting that the Plaintiff will never be a pilot or a soldier either. He is one kidney short, and has difficulty doing strenuous activities – I cannot see how he could possibly contemplate such physically taxing vocations. However, I have difficulties accepting that the Plaintiff could even have <em>qualified</em> for these jobs in the first place. Quite separate from the fact that this sort of argument should really have been framed as a claim in <em>loss of chance</em> (see [68] above), the Plaintiff did not produce any credible evidence of his prospects at becoming a soldier or a pilot. Joining the National Cadet Corps as a co-curricular activity in secondary school says little about his <em>eligibility</em> to join the armed forces. This is particularly so, given that the Plaintiff’s expressed desires were to join <em>elite</em> vocations within the military (<em>eg</em> the Guards or Commandos), and to serve in <em>leadership</em> capacities (<em>ie</em> as a specialist or as an officer).<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_139" id="Ftn_139_1"><sup>[note: 139]</sup></a> It was just not clear what were the eligibility requirements for these jobs (the screenshots from the Singapore Armed Forces website that the Plaintiff produced were not helpful),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_140" id="Ftn_140_1"><sup>[note: 140]</sup></a></span> and whether the Plaintiff was on track to fulfilling them prior to the accident.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86">86&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This difficulty was even more pronounced when it came to the Plaintiff’s aviation ambitions.

It is clear that he has suffered a competitive disadvantage, in that the portfolio of work that he can reasonably handle has been reduced by his injuries.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89">89&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separately, I am of the view the Plaintiff has also suffered a <em>further</em> loss of earning capacity in that there is a real risk of him losing his job, and that he will, because of the injuries, be at a disadvantage in the open employment market (see [78(c)] above). I fully accept that there is no evidence of SGLabs being dissatisfied with the Plaintiff’s performance, or any indication that they find it too difficult to accommodate this disabilities and injuries.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_149" id="Ftn_149_1"><sup>[note: 149]</sup></a> If anything, SGLabs hired the Plaintiff knowing full well about his disabilities,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_150" id="Ftn_150_1"><sup>[note: 150]</sup></a></span> and has retained him past his probationary period.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_151" id="Ftn_151_1"><sup>[note: 151]</sup></a></span> In that sense, one could be forgiven for assuming that there is no real risk of the Plaintiff losing his job.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90">90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the truth is, an employer is always entitled to change his/her mind. And though the employer does not express any reservations about employing the Plaintiff <em>now</em>, that state of affairs may change in the future. The key question then, is not so much whether the employer is <em>presently</em> dissatisfied/uncomfortable employing the Plaintiff, but what is the probability that the employer would terminate the Plaintiff’s employment <em>at some point</em>, on account of his disabilities. That is the true test. That is what the Court of Appeal meant when it articulated the test in <em>Samuel Chai</em>:</a></p><a id="p1_90"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;… an award for loss of earning capacity (in the context where the plaintiff is currently employed) can only be awarded <em>if there is substantial or real risk</em> that the plaintiff could lose his or her present job <b><em>at some time before the estimated end of his or her working life</em></b> and that the plaintiff will, because of the injuries, be at a disadvantage in the open employment market.

Like her, he cannot perform the full range of responsibilities that may arise from his job. The plaintiff in <em>Samuel Chai</em> could not “work long hours, attend to patients in wards, and physically assist patients”: <em>Samuel Chai</em> at [37]. He, similarly, cannot carry heavy machinery or “go to the field for a prolonged number of months”.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_152" id="Ftn_152_1"><sup>[note: 152]</sup></a> Like <em>Samuel Chai’s</em> plaintiff, he cannot count on job security from long years of employment either. The plaintiff in <em>Samuel Chai</em> was a “fairly new employee” and “not a long-standing part-time employee” at both of the physiotherapy practices that she worked at: <em>Samuel Chai</em> at [37]. The Plaintiff here, similarly, was a relatively new hire who had just passed his probationary period. Taking these facts into consideration, the Court of Appeal in <em>Samuel Chai</em> took the view that there was “clearly some degree of uncertainty” about the plaintiff’s employment, and that she had a real risk of losing her job: <em>Samuel Chai</em> at [37]. That same conclusion, in my view, is warranted by the present case as well.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92">92&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then, would be the disadvantage suffered if the Plaintiff was compelled to re-enter the labour market? Clearly, he is far less attractive as a potential hire than an able-bodied person of similar skill and ability.

The question then turns to quantum – how will the Plaintiff’s entitlement to damages for LEC be quantified?</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The proper quantum to award for the Plaintiff’s loss of earning capacity </p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The proper methodology for quantifying loss of earning capacity</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93">93&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditionally, LEC awards have been quantified “in the round” using a “rough and ready” approach (“<b>R&amp;R approach</b>”): <em>Pamela Jane</em> at [141]. That means Courts ordinarily award a global sum after taking into account factors such as the plaintiff’s age, his skills, the nature of his disability, whether he is capable of undertaking only one type of work or whether he is capable of undertaking other types of work as well: <em>Pamela Jane</em> at [141]. LFE awards on the other hand, have traditionally been derived using a multiplier/multiplicand approach (“<b>M&amp;M approach</b>”): <em>Teo Ai Ling (CA)</em> at [37]. As the Court of Appeal explained in <em>Quek Yen Fei (CA)</em> at [42], “[the] multiplicand represents the quantum of loss that the claimant is expected to suffer at periodic intervals in the future [while the] multiplier is the mathematical tool used to calculate the lump-sum present value of the stream of future periodic losses across the period of future loss of the claimant”. Ordinarily, the difference in earnings between the plaintiff’s pre-accident and post-accident income would form the basis of the multiplicand: <em>Lee Wei Kong</em> at [29].</a></p><a id="p1_93"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a><a id="p1_94">94&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That distinction – the usage of the R&amp;R approach in LEC awards; and the M&amp;M approach in LFE awards – was thought to be settled law, with the Court of Appeal in <em>Pamela Jane</em> explicitly pronouncing that:</a></p><a id="p1_94"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">141&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making awards for loss of future earning capacity, it is not appropriate to use any of the formulas commonly employed to calculate awards for loss of future earnings, such as the multiplicand and multiplier method […] The court must take a “rough and ready” approach (see [<em>Michael Clark</em>] at [91]) and calculate the loss of earning capacity “in the round” (see <em>Smith</em> at 8), ultimately arriving at a figure that it considers reasonable in the particular circumstances to compensate the particular plaintiff for the disadvantage which he faces in the open employment market due to his disabilities…</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a><a id="">This echoed the Court of Appeal’s earlier statements in <em>Chang Ah Lek v Lim Ah Koon</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1998] 3 SLR(R) 0551.xml')">[1998] 3 SLR(R) 551</a> (“<b><em>Chang Ah Lek</em></b>”) at [27], and the approach taken in cases like <em>Teo Ai Ling (CA)</em> (see [53] – [54]) and <em>Samuel Chai</em> (see [38]). It similarly echoed Prakash J’s (as she then was) observations in <em>Michael Clark</em> that the use of the M&amp;M approach in quantifying LEC awards was “not very satisfactory as it makes the award akin to an award for loss of future earnings”: <em>Michael Clark</em> at [91].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95">95&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in seeming contradiction with its earlier pronouncements in <em>Pamela Jane</em>, the Court of Appeal in <em>Quek Yen Fei (CA)</em> later applied the M&amp;M approach to a claim for <em>LEC</em>. There is no discussion in <em>Quek Yen Fei (CA)</em> about the appropriateness of using the M&amp;M approach in quantifying an LEC claim. There is no such discussion in <em>Quek Yen Fei (HC)</em> either. If anything, the Court of Appeal seems to have accepted the High Court’s use of the M&amp;M approach, making only a small adjustment to the multiplier to be applied: <em>Quek Yen Fei (CA)</em> at [100]. As such, there now stands a decision of the apex court specifically applying and seemingly approving the use of the M&amp;M approach in quantifying LEC awards.</a></p><a id="p1_95"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a><a id="p1_96">96&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, I was invited to (politely) disregard <em>Quek Yen Fei (CA)</em> as an “anomalous” authority that “conflated loss of earning capacity with loss of future earnings”.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_156" id="Ftn_156_1"><sup>[note: 156]</sup></a> It was suggested that I follow in the footsteps of fellow State Courts deputy registrars – at least two, at last count – that had explicitly declined to adopt the M&amp;M approach.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_157" id="Ftn_157_1"><sup>[note: 157]</sup></a></span> Indeed, my own survey of the authorities suggests that <em>Quek Yen Fei (CA)</em> has received somewhat lukewarm reception at the High Court as well. Though cited in <em>Yeo Chee Siong v Salpac (S) Pte Ltd and another</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21066-SSP.xml')">[2017] SGHC 304</a> ((“<b><em>Yeo Chee Siong</em></b>”) at [33]), its M&amp;M approach was ultimately ignored in favour of <em>Michael Clark</em>’s R&amp;R approach when the LEC award was quantified (see <em>Yeo Chee Siong</em> at [42]). In <em>Tan Hun Boon v Rui Feng Travel Pte Ltd and another</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21360-SSP.xml')">[2018] 3 SLR 244</a> (“<b><em>Tan Hun Boon</em></b>”), there was some suggestion that the High Court was applying <em>Quek Yen Fei (CA)</em>’s M&amp;M approach (see [130]). Ultimately however, the High Court in <em>Tan Hun Boon</em> did not identify an LEC multiplicand, and granted an award of $150,000 – a round figure precisely of the sort that is derived from an R&amp;R approach. And in <em>Ng Lay Peng v Gain City Engineering &amp; Consultancy Pte Ltd (Ng Peng Boon, third party) (AXA Insurance Singapore Pte Ltd, intervener)</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24288-SSP.xml')">[2020] 3 SLR 271</a> (“<b><em>Ng Lay Peng</em></b>”), <em>Quek Yen Fei (CA)</em> was disregarded altogether. Neither <em>Quek Yen Fei (CA)</em>, nor its M&amp;M approach to LEC were mentioned at all. Again, the LEC award was derived with the R&amp;R approach, and calculated “in the round” (see <em>Ng Lay Peng</em> at [150]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97">97&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all its apparent unpopularity, <em>Quek Yen Fei (CA)</em> remains good law. It is a standing authority from the Court of Appeal that has not been reconsidered or otherwise doubted by our apex court. If anything, its approach was applied (albeit in a slightly different manner) by the Court of Appeal recently in <em>Yvonne Yap</em> (at [72]). I am bound by the decision and will not jettison <em>stare decisis</em> on account of any disagreements I may have with the decision. As it happens, I do <em>not</em> disagree with <em>Quek Yen Fei (CA)</em>. I am of the view that it can be rationalised and woven into the juristic tapestry of the law on LEC. I am of the view that the M&amp;M approach, if suitably adapted, <em>can</em> be a meaningful tool in the court’s arsenal when it comes to quantifying LEC claims. And ultimately, I am of the view that practical justice – a theme I will return to later on – can be achieved without sacrificing conceptual or doctrinal hygiene.</a></p><a id="p1_97"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a><a id="p1_98">98&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the use of the M&amp;M approach in the context of quantifying LEC claims for three reasons. They are reasons rooted in principle, precedent, and policy.</a></p><a id="p1_98"> <p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principle </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a><a id="p1_99">99&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quantification method should only be adopted if it is capable of gauging the particular loss that it seeks to measure. The loss here, in the LEC context, is the weakening of a plaintiff’s competitive position: <em>Pamela Jane</em> at [140]. This loss, it should be appreciated, may be experienced as a <em>one-off</em> event (<em>eg</em> when a plaintiff is fired and thrust into the open labour market, having to compete with more able-bodied candidates for a job), or as a <em>continuing</em> disability (<em>eg</em> when a plaintiff’s injuries place him at a continuing disadvantage compared to his peers in competing for performance related salary increments/promotions). If one had assumed that competitive disadvantages could <em>only</em> be experienced as discrete/one-off events, I would understand the discomfort with quantifying that loss through the M&amp;M approach. An M&amp;M approach inherently contemplates a “<em>period</em> of future loss” and assumes that there is a “stream of future periodic losses” (<em>Quek Yen Fei (CA)</em> at [42]). In that sense, it would be conceptually incorrect to use the M&amp;M approach in quantifying what might otherwise be a one-time loss.</a></p><a id="p1_99"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a><a id="p1_100">100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the law now recognises that LEC <em>can</em> be experienced as a continuing disadvantage. A high-school dropout, amputated below the knee, may face <em>enduring</em> difficulties in any sort of manual work that he might be employed to do (<em>eg Quek Yen Fei (HC)</em> at [89]). A human resource consultant may well experience fatigue and have difficulties concentrating for the <em>rest</em> of his working life (<em>eg Tan Hun Boon</em> at [138] and [142]). A labourer, afflicted with a stiff back from a fractured vertebrae, would have <em>continuing</em> difficulties in lifting heavy loads, as may be expected in his line of work (<em>Mutyalu Eswarudu v Lucky Joint Construction Pte Ltd</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26647-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGDC 202</a> (“<b><em>Mutyalu</em></b>”) at [50] and [56]). And these sorts of losses, stretched and experienced over a long time frame, would be precisely the sort of losses that an M&amp;M approach is designed to address.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101">101&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So understood, an M&amp;M approach would be well-suited to address at least <em>one</em> variant of the mischief targeted by LEC claims. I recognise that there is some artificiality in saying that somebody would <em>actually</em> suffer <em>periodic</em> losses of say, $100, on account of his continuing competitive disadvantages. But I am prepared to treat this as a necessary myth, no more (and no less) a legal fiction than the suggestion that a <em>lump sum</em> of $10,000 is an <em>actual</em> reflection of the competitive disadvantage suffered by a given plaintiff.</a></p><a id="p1_101"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a><a id="p1_102">102&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, this – acknowledging the potential applicability of the M&amp;M approach to LEC claims – does no violence to the conceptual distinction between LEC and LFE either. The loss addressed is <em>still</em> the one that lies at the heart of LEC claims (<em>ie</em> the weakening of a plaintiff’s competitive position). If anything, the M&amp;M approach, in deriving a proper multiplicand, is more than capable of taking into consideration the various factual circumstances that affect the extent of a plaintiff’s weakened position (to be explained later). The loss addressed is <em>not</em> the sort of “real assessable loss proved by evidence” (described in <em>Samuel Chai</em> at [12]) that is rightfully framed as an LFE claim. And the M&amp;M approach does <em>not</em> simply “compensate for the difference between the [plaintiff’s] post-accident and pre-accident income or rate of income” (as described in <em>Samuel Chai</em> at [20]).</a></p><a id="p1_102"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a><a id="p1_103">103&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, although the M&amp;M approach’s roots are in LFE claims, that sort of nostalgia should not preclude its in-principle applicability to LEC claims. Sure, using the M&amp;M approach in LEC claims may make the award “akin to an award for [LFE]”. But to that, I would only suggest that using French culinary techniques does not mean one is preparing French cuisine.</a></p><a id="p1_103"> <p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Precedent </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a><a id="p1_104">104&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also defend the use of the M&amp;M approach in LEC claims by addressing two broad categories of authorities. The first is a pair of authorities that have explicitly referenced, doubted and ultimately declined to apply <em>Quek Yen Fei (CA)</em>’s M&amp;M approach in LEC cases. The other is a group of authorities that have explicitly endorsed the R&amp;R approach, to the seeming exclusion of the M&amp;M approach.</a></p><a id="p1_104"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a><a id="p1_105">105&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first category of cases, strong reservations were expressed about <em>Quek Yen Fei (CA)</em> and its M&amp;M approach: <em>Fadhli</em> and <em>Lai Mok @ Lee Peng Sung v SBS Transit Ltd and another</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24766-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGDC 151</a> (“<b><em>Lai Mok</em></b><em>”</em>). The nub of the discomfort was that <em>Quek Yen Fei (CA)</em> did not offer any “practical principles or guidance as to how the [M&amp;M approach] ought to be applied in the assessment of LEC”: <em>Lai Mok</em> at [47] (see also <em>Fadhli</em> at [74]). And beyond that, as the learned DR in <em>Fadhli</em> pointed out, “the multiplicand in [<em>Quek Yen Fei</em>] appears to have been derived in a manner virtually indistinguishable from the [R&amp;R approach] advanced in <em>Samuel Chai</em> and [<em>Pamela Jane</em>]”: <em>Fadhli</em> at [75].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106">106&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognise that there is no explicit guidance on how to derive the multiplicand in a principled fashion. And there is much force in the observation that deriving the multiplicand under the M&amp;M approach effectively utilises the same heuristics as the R&amp;R approach. But if the difficulty is with identifying the relevant factors for consideration, a solution might simply be to infer/distil them from the facts of the case (and of course, if necessary, to have that corrected on appeal). And if the difficulty is with the <em>qualitative</em> manner in which the multiplicand seems to have been derived, one could equally say the same about the R&amp;R approach – a methodology that <em>Lai Mok</em> and <em>Fadhli</em> had no issues applying. More pertinently, neither of these authorities offer a reason in <em>principle</em>, for rejecting <em>Quek Yen Fei (CA)</em>’s M&amp;M approach. As stated earlier, a <em>continuing</em> competitive disadvantage may well be better estimated with an M&amp;M approach, a methodology which inherently addresses continuing losses, experienced over a certain time horizon.</a></p><a id="p1_106"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a><a id="p1_107">107&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second category of cases are the authorities that have seemingly endorsed the R&amp;R approach <em>over</em> the M&amp;M approach.

Those were simply not cases discussing the appropriateness of the M&amp;M approach or the preferability of the R&amp;R approach. <em>Samuel Chai</em> was concerned with a larger conceptual issue – the distinction between LFE and LEC – and the parts cited by <em>Pamela Jane</em> (<em>Samuel Chai</em> at [15]) were really just part of a broader survey of the English authorities to clarify the distinction between LFE and LEC (see <em>Samuel Chai</em> at [10] – [15]). <em>Chang Ah Leck</em> was concerned with whether LEC ought to have been granted at all and whether the judge below had properly assessed the evidence in rejecting the LFE claim (see <em>Chang Ah Leck</em> at [30] – [31]).

Her honour had effectively made an LFE award but couched it in the language of LEC. The analysis was centred on the difference in pre-accident and post-accident income. The analysis was focused on the sort of loss that is addressed in LFE awards. The analysis was not directed at the loss which LEC awards are supposed to target (“the weakness in the round”). And so it was no surprise that a wholesale adoption of the M&amp;M approach <em>directed towards LFE-type losses</em>, was criticised. Notably, the Court of Appeal did not foreclose the possibility of the M&amp;M approach being used if it <em>properly</em> addressed the sort of losses contemplated in LEC awards.</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_110">110&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is <em>Pamela Jane</em> (see [94] above). There, the Court of Appeal cited <em>Michael Clark</em> and <em>Smith</em> for the proposition that “the court must take [an R&amp;R approach] and calculate loss of earning capacity “in the round””: <em>Pamela Jane</em> at [141]. It then cited <em>Samuel Chai</em> and <em>Moeliker</em> as authority for the proposition that it is “not <b><em>appropriate</em></b> to use any of the formulas commonly employed to calculate awards for loss of future earnings such as the [M&amp;M approach]”: <em>Pamela Jane</em> at [141] (emphasis mine).

That makes perfect sense. An M&amp;M approach may appear to offer a misleadingly tidy solution to what is clearly a fact-sensitive inquiry. Embedded in it, is a certain kind of mathematical heuristic that seems suspiciously neat, and apt to produce only spurious precision. The potential arrogance of such an arithmetic approach may have been what unsettled the English Court of Appeal. This would be supported, albeit obliquely, by Scarman LJ’s opinion in <em>Smith</em> itself:</a></p><a id="p1_112"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is clearly inappropriate, when assessing this element of loss to attempt to calculate any annual sum or to apply to any annual sum so many years' purchase.

When it described the M&amp;M approach as “inappropriate”, it must be a criticism of the <em>pitfalls</em> of the M&amp;M approach, and not a complete rejection of the same; a caution, rather than a prohibition.</a></p><a id="p1_113"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a><a id="p1_114">114&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, in my view, would be the reading that best reconciles the Court of Appeal’s use of the M&amp;M approach in <em>Quek Yen Fei</em> (see [95] above), alongside its previous statements that seemingly disapprove of its usage in the LEC context.</a></p><a id="p1_114"> <p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Policy </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a><a id="p1_115">115&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, something ought to be said of the broader policy of the courts when it comes to matters of lost future earnings (whether it be future earnings or future earning capacity). The law has always recognised that in some cases, a plaintiff may not be able to provide sufficient evidence of his loss to establish a claim for LFE. That, of course, is no <em>excuse</em> or <em>justification</em> for an award of LEC (see <em>Samuel Chai</em> at [20] and [22]), but has often been the <em>occasion</em> for the Court to consider an award for LEC. This represents the law’s dynamism, and readiness to ensure that all loss – even if incapable of <em>precise</em> quantification – is addressed meaningfully. Being somewhat ineffable, LEC has been quantified with a correspondingly loose (and possibly imprecise) methodology – the R&amp;R approach. But that is practical justice. And more importantly, that does not represent a pedantic attachment to an (admittedly) impressionistic methodology.</a></p><a id="p1_115"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a><a id="p1_116">116&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being so, I cannot see why LEC awards <em>must</em> be quantified with the R&amp;R approach, to the exclusion of any other methodology. So long as the M&amp;M approach is suitably tailored to address the loss that lies at the heart of LEC claims, I am of the view that the law’s impulse for practical justice can be supported without sullying conceptual correctness. This brings me to the <em>manner</em> in which the M&amp;M approach may be used in quantifying an LEC award.</a></p><a id="p1_116"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">How the M&amp;M approach may be used in claims for loss of earning capacity </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a><a id="p1_117">117&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, the authorities suggest that there are two ways in which the M&amp;M approach may be used when quantifying claims for loss of earning capacity:</a></p><a id="p1_117"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117"></a><a id="p1_117-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the multiplier/multiplicand method may be used to confirm the reasonableness of a figure derived using the R&amp;R approach.</a></p><a id="p1_117-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_117-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, where the particular competitive disadvantage is experienced on a <em>continuing</em> basis, the M&amp;M approach may be used to <em>directly</em> quantify the LEC award.</a></p><a id="p1_117-p2_b"> <p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Situation 1: Confirmatory use of the M&amp;M approach</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_118">118&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is relatively uncontroversial that a court, having arrived at a provisional figure for a LEC award using the R&amp;R approach, may then apply the multiplier/multiplicand method to ascertain the reasonableness of this provisional figure.</a></p><a id="p1_118"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a><a id="p1_119">119&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Winston Tan</em>, the High Court observed (at [45]):</a></p><a id="p1_119"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the court [could], merely for the purpose of doing a very rough check, determine if the amount that was assessed “in the round” was within a reasonable range (i.e. neither manifestly inadequate nor too excessive). That check could be achieved by computing what that lump sum amount to be awarded would have in effect produced, if it was distributed as a stream of income per month in the future over the period of the working life of the plaintiff, assuming a certain rate of interest to be used as a discount rate for the computation. The result from such a simple mathematical computation or annuity analysis provides, in my view, a useful parameter to make a very rough check on whether or not the assessment of the lump sum “in the round” so to speak, could have gone simply too far wrong either way. I believe it would help avoid an overly excessive or manifestly inadequate estimate of a ball-park figure by the court for the loss of earning capacity assessed primarily on the relevant facts and circumstances of the case.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a><a id="p1_120">120&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, in <em>Winston Tan</em>, the High Court arrived at a provisional figure of $100,000 for LEC after making an assessment “in the round” (at [49]). It then went on to confirm the reasonableness of this amount using the multiplier/multiplicand approach. Working backwards, the High Court calculated that an award of $100,000 would equate to an award of approximately $530.30 a month (the multiplicand) over 35 years (the multiplier) based on a discount interest rate of 5.33% per annum. The High Court was satisfied that this was reasonable and ultimately made an award of $100,000 for LEC.</a></p><a id="p1_120"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a><a id="p1_121">121&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal used the multiplier/multiplicand method in a similar, albeit not identical, way in <em>Yvonne Yap</em>. The Court of Appeal accepted the factual findings made by the High Court, but observed that the LEC award had been made without “[providing] any specific reasons” (at [72]). The Court of Appeal confirmed the reasonableness of this figure by applying the multiplier/multiplicand method (at [72]-[75]). Unlike the High Court in <em>Winston Tan</em>, the Court of Appeal in <em>Yvonne Yap</em> did not work backwards from the figure of $80,000 but set about to determine afresh an appropriate multiplier and multiplicand. It alighted on an (annual) multiplicand of $5,733 and a multiplier of 15 years and observed that the ensuing aggregate sum of $85,995 was “close to” the amount awarded by the High Court: <em>Yvonne Yap</em> at [75]. The Court of Appeal thus upheld the High Court’s award of $80,000 for LEC.</a></p><a id="p1_121"> <p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Situation 2: Direct quantification of continuing competitive disadvantage</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a><a id="p1_122">122&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond its use in a <em>confirmatory</em> sense, the M&amp;M approach may also be used to <em>directly</em> quantify an award for loss of earning capacity. As alluded to earlier (see [100] above), there are species of competitive disadvantages that may be experienced on a continuing basis by the plaintiff. These could be <em>directly</em> quantified by a methodology that contemplates future loss being experienced over a certain time horizon. In these situations, the multiplicand would be a proxy for the <em>extent</em> of loss; and the multiplier, a proxy for the <em>period</em> for which that loss might be experienced. Determining the multiplicand would be a fact sensitive exercise (as suggested by the approach taken in <em>Quek Yen Fei (CA)</em> at [109]) and the multiplier would simply be the “remaining working life of the claimant but for the accident”: <em>Quek Yen Fei (CA)</em> at [92]. It would be useful, at this point, to illustrate the approach by reference to the authorities that have thus far applied the M&amp;M approach to LEC claims.</a></p><a id="p1_122"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a><a id="p1_123">123&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Quek Yen Fei (HC)</em> (and the appeal arising from it) involved a plaintiff who suffered serious injuries from a road traffic accident. His right leg had to be amputated below the knee as it was severely manged, and he suffered a fracture to his right collarbone as well. At the time of the accident, he was a Secondary Three dropout who had been shuttling between various part-time jobs prior to National Service enlistment. He had also fractured both his wrists in a prior unrelated accident. These facts suggested to the Judge that the plaintiff was likely, accident or not, to have been employed for manual work: <em>Quek Yen Fei (HC)</em> at [89]. Therefore, the physical injuries would <em>directly</em> impact his ability to carry out such manual work and he would have been “likely to receive a lower income than an able-bodied person doing the same job”: <em>Quek Yen Fei (HC)</em> at [89]. That said, allowance was also made for the fact that he had <em>already</em> been handicapped in a prior unrelated accident: <em>Quek Yen Fei (HC)</em> at [90]. In other words, the disadvantage he was likely to experience was not <em>entirely</em> attributable to the accident at hand. All this was estimated at a monthly multiplicand of $750.</a></p><a id="p1_123"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a><a id="p1_124">124&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the multiplier, the High Court placed primary emphasis on the fact that the plaintiff was a 24-year-old man at the time of assessment, and relied on <em>Teo Seng Kiat v Goh Hwa Teck</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2003] 1 SLR(R) 0333.xml')">[2003] 1 SLR(R) 333</a> (“<b><em>Teo Seng Kiat</em></b>”) where a multiplier of 18 years was applied to a 28-year-old man. This multiplier was, according to the court in <em>Teo Seng Kiat</em>, “the current trend in relation to “healthy young men””. <em>Quek Yen Fei (HC)</em> accordingly adopted a multiplier of 18 years. On appeal, this figure was increased to 20 years. Having regard to the statutory minimum retirement age of 67 years old, the Court of Appeal concluded that the plaintiff would have a “remaining working life of 43 years”: <em>Quek Yen Fei (CA)</em> at [94]. The Court adopted the annualised discount rates that were used in calculating the LFE multipliers in <em>Lee Wei Kong</em> and in <em>Teo Ai Ling (by her next friend Chua Wee Bee) v Koh Chai Kwang</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 2 SLR 1037.xml')">[2010] 2 SLR 1037</a> (“<b><em>Teo Ai Ling (HC)</em></b>”). Those were cases where the plaintiffs were similarly (a) “young persons who had long remaining working lives of over 40 years at the time of their assessments of damages” and (b) “likely to have worked in Singapore for the remainder of their working lives”: <em>Quek Yen Fei (CA)</em> at [99]. As such, the same annualised discount rate as that used in <em>Lee Wei Kong</em> and in <em>Teo Ai Ling (HC)</em> was used to derive a multiplier of 20 years: <em>Quek Yen Fei (CA)</em> at [100].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125">125&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Mutyalu</em> applied <em>Quek Yen Fei</em>’s M&amp;M approach to directly derive an LEC award of $10,000. Multiplicand wise, the Court valued the competitive disadvantage at $50 per month: <em>Mutyalu</em> at [56]. Though no specific reasons were given for that figure, it may be useful to note that the plaintiff there had been repatriated by the time of the assessment. Back at home, he was working at a farm, drop feeding pellets for 5,000 INR a month (approximately S$100): <em>Mutyalu</em> at [54]. The multiplicand, presumably, was drawn up with reference to the lower average salaries (translating to lower losses in earning capacity) that one could expect in India. And as for the multiplier, a discount rate of 4.8% per annum was applied to the plaintiff’s remaining working life of nearly 34 years. The final sum, working out to be $10,077.49, was rounded down to $10,000.</a></p><a id="p1_125"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a><a id="p1_126">126&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, there is <em>Yvonne Yap</em>. This case, as discussed above, was not strictly one where the LEC award was <em>directly</em> quantified using the M&amp;M approach. The M&amp;M approach was used to <em>confirm</em> the figure that the learned judge had assessed in the proceedings below That said, the Court of Appeal <em>did</em> quantify the LEC award afresh and it would be instructive to examine how that was done. With regard to the multiplicand, the Court of Appeal observed that “mobility and the ability to stand for longer durations would likely be <em>advantageous albeit not crucial or necessary</em>” for her job as a course facilitator: <em>Yvonne Yap</em> at [73] (emphasis mine). Therefore, The plaintiff’s permanent physical incapacity having been assessed at 14%, the Court found it appropriate to peg the multiplicand to half of that. Applying 7% to her last-drawn annual salary of $81,900, the Court derived an annual multiplicand of $5,733: <em>Yvonne Yap</em> at [73]</a></p><a id="p1_126"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a><a id="p1_127">127&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the multiplier, the Court of Appeal in <em>Yvonne Yap</em> recognised that the plaintiff had about 27 years remaining in her working life (assuming she retired at the re-employment age ceiling of 67). After applying the usual discount rate to account for her accelerated receipt of damages, as well as contingencies that would affect the length of her remaining working life, the Court alighted on a final multiplier of 15 years.</a></p><a id="p1_127"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a><a id="p1_128">128&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of these cases involved some sort of continuing competitive disadvantage that would be experienced by the plaintiffs for a certain future period. <em>Quek Yen Fei</em>’s plaintiff would doubtlessly be afflicted by a missing leg for the rest of his working life as a manual labourer. The same goes for <em>Mutyalu’s</em> plaintiff (a physical labourer) and his vertebrae fracture. And <em>Yvonne Yap</em>’s plaintiff would be handicapped in conducing her courses and facilitating them as she was not able stand for long durations or move around freely. That – the <em>continuing</em> nature of the competitive disadvantage that is experienced by these plaintiffs – is the golden thread that runs through the cases that have adopted the M&amp;M approach in quantifying LEC awards.</a></p><a id="p1_128"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a><a id="p1_129">129&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So understood, and having examined the authorities, I am guided by the following principles:</a></p><a id="p1_129"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_129"></a><a id="p1_129-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of years of working life that a plaintiff may have, would ordinarily be derived by deducting the plaintiff’s age at the time of assessment from the statutory retirement age. However, the statutory retirement age is just one factor, and “[owing] to such factors as the particular characteristics of the claimant and the nature of the work concerned, he may be expected to retire before, at or after the statutory retirement age”: <em>Quek Yen Fei (CA)</em> at [92].</a></p><a id="p1_129-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_129-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_129-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the discount for accelerated receipt and mortality risks that curtail the expected period of future loss (<em>Quek Yen Fei (CA)</em> at [43]), the multiplier may well take into account other contingencies such as the fact that someone might not work “in Singapore for the remainder of his working life”: <em>Quek Yen Fei (CA)</em> at [99], citing <em>Poh Huat Heng Corp Pte Ltd v Hafizul Islam Kofil Uddin</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 3 SLR 1003.xml')">[2012] 3 SLR 1003</a> (“<b><em>Poh Huat Heng</em></b>”) at [59].</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_129-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deriving the multiplicand would ultimately be a fact sensitive exercise but regard must always be had to the competitive disadvantage that might <em>actually</em> be experienced by the plaintiff in the future. Someone working as a <em>manual labourer</em> would doubtlessly be affected by an amputated knee (<em>Quek Yen Fei</em>), but that same injury may not have the same impact on a course facilitator who will not rely so heavily on her physical strength in the course of her work. Needless to say, tibia fractures, though an impediment, would perhaps have a limited impact on her actual earning capacity as a course facilitator (<em>Yvonne Yap</em> at [73]).</a></p><a id="p1_129-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_130">130&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in <em>obiter</em>, I would suggest that the M&amp;M approach may also be used to directly quantify a LEC award in situations where LEC overlaps with LFE as a head of damages.

In <em>Samuel Chai</em>, the Court of Appeal expressed the distinction between LFE and LEC in the following way (at [20]):</a></p><a id="p1_131"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… These two heads of damages are meant to compensate for different losses – loss of future earnings compensates for the difference between the post-accident and pre-accident income or rate of income, while loss of earning capacity compensates for the risk or disadvantage, which the plaintiff would suffer in the event that he or she should lose the job that he or she currently holds, in securing an equivalent job in the open employment market. …</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a><a id="p1_132">132&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that there is no <em>necessary</em> overlap between LFE and LEC. Depending on the facts, a plaintiff may well be entitled to separate awards for both. The Court of Appeal specifically addressed this possibility in <em>Samuel Chai</em> at [24]-[25]:</a></p><a id="p1_132"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there is one other general comment which we would make. There is nothing in principle which bars a plaintiff from being entitled to claim for both loss of future earnings and loss of earning capacity, provided that the necessary evidence is present. …</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reiterate again, loss of future earnings and loss of earning capacity compensate different losses. We can best illustrate the point by an example. Suppose an injured person was taken back by his pre-accident employer to do a less demanding job due to his disabilities but at a lower pay. If the employer cannot guarantee how long he will be so employed but will do so as long as possible, it seems to us that the injured victim should be entitled to awards based on both heads of damages.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a><a id="p1_133">133&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, <em>in certain factual situations</em>, LFE and LEC may well overlap in that the losses they seek to address are one and the same. The possibility of such an overlap is illustrated by the cases of <em>Rakibul</em> and <em>Chang Ah Lek</em>.</a></p><a id="p1_133"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a><a id="p1_134">134&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Rakibul</em>, the plaintiff was working in Singapore as a construction worker at the time at the time of the accident. As a result of his injuries, he was working in lower-paying odd jobs and menial jobs in Bangladesh at the time of the assessment. The Deputy Registrar awarded the plaintiff $27,792 for LFE (see [38]-[66]) but, despite finding that he had also satisfied the applicable test for LEC (see [101]-[106]), declined to make an additional LEC award. This was because the LFE award had already compensated the plaintiff for the difference between: (a) his future earnings in the construction industry in Singapore and Bangladesh had he not been injured; and (b) his future earnings now that he was confined to doing lower-paying odd jobs and other menial jobs in Bangladesh. As this represented the full extent of the financial damage the plaintiff might suffer because of his competitive disadvantage in the construction industry, an additional LEC award would lead to overcompensation ([107]-[132]).</a></p><a id="p1_134"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a><a id="p1_135">135&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in <em>Chang Ah Lek</em>, the plaintiff was an ironmonger working as a subcontractor dealing with iron works at the time of the accident. As a result of his injuries, he was working in a lower-paying job as an overseer at the time of the assessment. The Assistant Registrar appeared to award the plaintiff $51,000 for LFE and $17,000 for LEC. The High Court set these awards aside and dealt with the issues afresh. On further appeal, the Court of Appeal commented that, having awarded the plaintiff $51,000 for LFE, the AR was wrong to have also awarded $17,000 for LEC because “[t]his was two awards for the same item of loss” (at [22]).</a></p><a id="p1_135"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a><a id="p1_136">136&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where LFE and LEC overlap, the M&amp;M approach typically used to quantify LFE may also be usefully applied to quantify LEC. This view is consistent with, and may explain, the Court of Appeal’s use of the M&amp;M approach to quantify a LEC award in <em>Quek Yen Fei (CA)</em>. To recap (see [123]), the plaintiff was in National Service at the time of the accident. He had earlier dropped out of school three months into his repeat year for the Secondary Three Normal (Technical) course. In the four years before he commenced his National Service, he had been unable to secure a stable full-time job and shuttled between part-time jobs. The plaintiff was unemployed at the time of the assessment. The Court of Appeal assessed the plaintiff’s entitlement to damages for LFE and LEC in the following way. First, the Court of Appeal determined that a multiplier of 20 years would be appropriate (at [92]-[101]). Second, turning to the appropriate multiplicand, the Court of Appeal rejected the plaintiff’s claim for LFE because it was unclear, from his employment history, whether he could even have obtained employment and continued in such employment. There were therefore insufficient objective facts or evidence to enable a reasonable assessment of LFE (at [102]-[105]). However, the Court of Appeal agreed that the plaintiff was entitled to damages for LEC and determined that a multiplicand of $750 per month would be appropriate for this purpose (at [108]-[112]). The Court of Appeal thus awarded the plaintiff $180,000 for LEC, computed by multiplying the multiplicand of $750 a month by the multiplier of 20 years.</a></p><a id="p1_136"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a><a id="p1_137">137&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Quek Yen Fei</em>, therefore, could be understood as a situation where LFE and LEC would have overlapped had the evidence permitted an assessment of LFE. But for the accident, the plaintiff would likely have been engaged in manual work given his relatively low level of education. However, his injuries had significantly limited his ability to do manual work. Had an award for LFE been possible – <em>ie</em> had the plaintiff been able to demonstrate that he could have obtained employment and continued in such employment – it would have compensated the plaintiff for the difference between: (a) his future earnings in the manual work industry had he not been injured; and (b) his future earnings in the manual work industry now that he was injured. This would have represented the full extent of the financial damage the plaintiff might suffer because of his competitive disadvantage in the manual work industry. Given the overlap between LFE and LEC, it is perhaps unsurprising that the Court of Appeal adopted the multiplier/multiplicand method even when quantifying its award for LEC.</a></p><a id="p1_137"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a><a id="p1_138">138&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn then to the facts of the present case.</a></p><a id="p1_138"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The quantum that the Plaintiff is entitled to</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a><a id="p1_139">139&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated above, the Plaintiff has suffered a loss of earning capacity in two broad senses. The first, is the competitive disadvantage that comes with being unable to take on a full portfolio of responsibilities at work (see [88] above). This, I take to be a continuing disadvantage which is amenable to the M&amp;M approach. The second, is the risk that he would lose his present job and be thrust into the open labour market, having to compete against his more able-bodied peers (see [89] above). This, I do not regard as a continuing disadvantage, in that it would be a discrete event that occasions financial damage only on the contingency that he is thrust into the open labour market. I take each of these in turn.</a></p><a id="p1_139"> <p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Type of Competitive Disadvantage</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a><a id="p1_140">140&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I assess the number of years of working life that the Plaintiff has ahead of him. The Plaintiff is 26 years old at the time of assessment. The re-employment age ceiling (having reference to s 7A(11) of the Retirement and Re-employment Act 1993, the Retirement and Re-employment (Prescribed Re-employment Age) Notification 2022, and s 4(1) of the Retirement Age Act), is now 68 as of 1 July 2022. This means that the plaintiff has 42 years of working life ahead of him.</a></p><a id="p1_140"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a><a id="p1_141">141&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appropriate annualised discount rate would be in the range of that applied in <em>Lee Wei Kong</em> (4.27% per annum; 43 years of remaining working life), <em>Teo Ai Ling (HC)</em> (4.21% per annum; 42 years of remaining working life), and <em>Quek Yen Fei</em> (unspecified discount rate, but in the range of 4.2% - 4.3% per annum; 43 years of remaining working life). These were all young persons with long remaining working lives of over 40 years at the time of assessment. In my view, an average discount rate of 4.25% would be suitable, giving a multiplier of 20.26 for the present case.</a></p><a id="p1_141"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a><a id="p1_142">142&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am of the view that 20.26 should <em>not</em> be the final multiplier. In truth, the Plaintiff will only experience this particular competitive disadvantage for as long as he works at a job that involves some degree of physical labour. In those jobs, he will be handicapped in that he will not be able to handle the full portfolio of work. If he finds a more office-based job, I am not sure that his physical disabilities will necessarily be such an issue. Indeed, Dr Lee (the orthopaedic surgeon that the Plaintiff visited most frequently) took the view that the Plaintiff “should be able to do jobs, which are sedentary in nature and [do] not require carrying heavy objects”, and would only be “affected in jobs/occupations that require carrying of weights, prolonged standing and walking and climbing of stairs, ladders, scaffolds and platforms.”.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_158" id="Ftn_158_1"><sup>[note: 158]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143">143&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The better multiplier, therefore, should be 11. This would take into account the usual discounts given for accelerated receipt of lump-sum damages, and the mortality risks that might cut short the Plaintiff’s remaining working life. It would <em>also</em> take into account the contingency that the Plaintiff finds himself an office-based job – and he has consistently expressed his desire for one (“I am really pushing towards an office-based job”)<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_159" id="Ftn_159_1"><sup>[note: 159]</sup></a> – and the fact that finding such a job would minimise the otherwise continuing competitive disadvantage he would experience at his job. This contingency, it should be borne in mind, is <em>not</em> a hypothetical one. The Plaintiff has graduated (albeit with some difficulty) with a diploma. He is capable and, at least in my limited interaction with him, appears to be a personable man. Those qualities go some way towards his securing of a job more suited for his present condition.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144">144&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am fully aware that this might be experienced as a kind of unfairness – the Plaintiff should not have had to consider his disabilities in his job hunt at all. But these are the cards that the Plaintiff has been dealt. I can only grant awards based on the loss that he might <em>actually</em> experience, and must take into consideration contingencies such as these. In that regard, I simply cannot peg the Plaintiff’s multiplier here to those used in cases like <em>Teo Ai Ling (HC)</em>, <em>Quek Yen Fei (CA)</em> and <em>Lee Wei Kong</em> (other cases with young plaintiffs that had over 40 years of working life ahead of them). These were all cases where the plaintiffs had no further options. Their job prospects were shackled, as it were, to their injuries. There was no chance that <em>Teo Ai Ling</em>’s plaintiff was going to escape her eye injuries, hearing loss, and cognitive injuries by taking on a different job. There was no chance that <em>Lee Wei Kong</em>’s plaintiff would escape the effects of his loss of motor function, residual spasticity, mood instability, blindness in one eye, and cognitive impairments, by taking on a different job. In fact, he <em>did</em> attempt to pivot into a different career. He joined the LaSalle College of the Arts (“<b>LaSalle</b>”) hoping to pursue something he had an interest in, and hoping to become a painter or to work in some adjacent field. Those efforts were in vain. It turned out that he was unlikely to ever succeed as a painter or an art instructor: <em>Lee Wei Kong</em> at [34] and [38]. And for <em>Quek Yen Fei</em>’s plaintiff, his amputated knee would forever haunt him in whatever manual labour he would pick up. These plaintiffs did not have the benefit of a contingency – an escape plan from their circumstances. The Plaintiff does.</a></p><a id="p1_144"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a><a id="p1_145">145&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I am mindful that the approach laid out in <em>Quek Yen Fei (CA)</em>, and to some extent, the observations in <em>Poh Huat Heng</em> at [48] – [56], have been superseded by the introduction of the “Actuarial Tables with Explanatory Notes for use in Personal Injury and Death Claims” (“<b>the Tables</b>”). I have chosen not to use the Tables because they do not account for the contingency that I have described above. In any case, the State Courts Practice Directions 2013 (“<b>the PDs</b>”) clearly state that I am free to depart from the Tables if the “facts of the case and ends of justice” require me to. Of course, the PDs do not “empower” me to deviate from the Tables; but then again, the Tables were never binding on me in the first place.</a></p><a id="p1_145"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a><a id="p1_146">146&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn then to the multiplicand. My starting point is <em>Quek Yen Fei</em>, a case that similarly involved a young plaintiff with no serious income prior to his accident, and the only case to my knowledge where the Court of Appeal has expressly endorsed an <em>LEC</em> multiplicand for such a plaintiff. The monthly multiplicand used there was $750. That comes up to an annual multiplicand of $9,000. I cannot use that figure here. The Plaintiff here is far less impacted by his injuries. The medical evidence suggests that the Plaintiff does <em>not</em> suffer such a serious disability in the work that he does. His tibia fractures are really only perceptible in moments of exertion (see [47] above). For his one <em>permanent</em> disability (the partial restriction in range of motion in his wrist, as described at [41(b)] above), the extent of its impact on his work was never explored at the hearing/in his affidavit evidence-in-chief.</a></p><a id="p1_146"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a><a id="p1_147">147&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond that, and without discounting or demeaning the horrific nature of his injuries, the kidney, diaphragm and lung related injuries do not appear to have any meaningful implications for his ability to work either. Indeed, Dr Leanne Leong (the nephrology expert) only advised the Plaintiff to avoid “strenuous <b>sports</b>” and to “adhere to a low sodium diet […]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_160" id="Ftn_160_1"><sup>[note: 160]</sup></a> She further noted that “apart from that, [the Plaintiff was] expected to be fit to work.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_161" id="Ftn_161_1"><sup>[note: 161]</sup></a></span> Dr Bonney (the hepatobiliary surgeon) was likewise of the opinion that “from the liver point of view there should be no long-term result of this on his occupation”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_162" id="Ftn_162_1"><sup>[note: 162]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148">148&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The better annual multiplicand, therefore, would be $6,000. That would take into account the <em>actual</em> impact that his injuries have on the portfolio of work that he can take up. It would also take into account the <em>actual</em> financial damage that the Plaintiff stands to suffer on account of his reduced ability to work. He is certainly more qualified than <em>Quek Yen Fei</em>’s plaintiff. He stands, on average, to earn a higher salary. And in that sense, he stands to lose more as well. $6,000 would, in my view, be a fair annual multiplicand that accounts for these two distinguishing factors.</a></p><a id="p1_148"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a><a id="p1_149">149&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should make clear that the Plaintiff’s suggestion of $1,000 as a monthly multiplicand (coming up to $12,000 as an annual multiplicand) was excessive and founded on conceptual confusion. Excessive, for the reasons I have stated above; and conceptually unsound, because it seems to be loosely based on the difference between his salary from Angel Manufacturing ($3,500/month), and his salary from SGLabs ($2,400/month):</a></p><a id="p1_149"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_149"></a><a id="p1_149-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Plaintiff’s view is that he <em>would have otherwise earned</em> $3,500/month but is now resigned to earning $2,400/month, he should have framed his claim as one in LFE. There was nothing to stop him from doing so. Young plaintiffs like the Plaintiff have sought – and <em>succeeded</em> – in claims for LFE, notwithstanding that they had no pre-accident income from which to derive an LFE multiplicand: <em>Lee Wei Kong</em> at [33]. That, unfortunately, was not the Plaintiff’s pleaded case.</a></p><a id="p1_149-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_149-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_149-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Plaintiff’s suggestion is that he has <em>already lost</em> $1,100/month from taking up a lower paying job at SGLabs, that is a clearly definable and quantifiable loss. More importantly, it is a loss <em>in the past</em> and should have been claimed as pre-trial loss of income. I note that parties have already agreed on the appropriate award for pre-trial loss of income.</a></p><a id="p1_149-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_149-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_149-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Plaintiff’s suggestion is that I should consider the kind of multiplicand that I might have used in assessing an LFE claim to derive an LEC multiplicand, that would be plainly wrong. I would be committing the same mistake that the Court of Appeal roundly criticised in <em>Chang Ah Lek</em>.</a></p><a id="p1_149-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_150">150&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even taking the Plaintiff’s case at its highest, I can only accept that the <em>factors</em> which go towards deriving an LFE multiplicand <em>for young plaintiffs</em> might be <em>considered</em> in deriving the Plaintiff’s LEC multiplicand. These factors would be found in cases like <em>Peh Diana and another v Tan Miang Lee</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1991] 1 SLR(R) 0022.xml')">[1991] 1 SLR(R) 22</a>, <em>Lai Chi Kay v Lee Kuo Shin</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1981-1982] SLR(R) 0071.xml')">[1981–1982] SLR(R) 71</a> (“<b><em>Lai Chi Kay</em></b>”), <em>Teo Ai Ling (HC)</em> and <em>Lee Wei Kong</em>. Those were all instances where, owing to the nature of the plaintiffs, the multiplicand had to be derived “from scratch”. There was no pre-accident income with which to compare the post-accident income. As such, the Courts used career models (that is, the likely salary from the career that the young plaintiff might have otherwise embarked on) as a heuristic substitute for pre-accident income. For example, <em>Lai Chi Kay</em> used a doctor’s career model to estimate what the medical student-plaintiff might otherwise have earned but for the accident. If such a clear career trajectory cannot be identified, some reasonable estimate such as the average starting salary of a university student, or the average salary of a civil servant was taken instead (see <em>Lee Wei Kong</em> at [39] and <em>Teo Ai Ling (CA)</em> at [32] – [36]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151">151&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here however, there was just no need to rely on any career model. As I found above at [83], the Plaintiff was training to be, and did in fact become an engineer. And beyond that, by the Plaintiff’s own admission, the “median gross starting salary of a post National Service graduate in Engineering Systems and Management in 2018 was about $2,315”.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_163" id="Ftn_163_1"><sup>[note: 163]</sup></a><em>Both</em> of his jobs post-graduation were higher than that.

But when asked if he had a more updated statistic, the Plaintiff simply had no answer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_164" id="Ftn_164_1"><sup>[note: 164]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152">152&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, <em>Lee Wei Kong</em> and <em>Teo Ai Ling (HC)</em> were all cases where the plaintiffs suffered serious injuries that <em>directly affected their ability to work</em>. <em>Lee Wei Kong</em>’s plaintiff could not graduate from junior college. He was barely coping with his studies at LaSalle (an option he took up after the accident derailed his “A” level studies) and there was every indication that LaSalle would be awarding him a Diploma in Arts “out of sympathy”: <em>Lee Wei Kong</em> at [34] and [38]. <em>Teo Ai Ling (HC)</em>’s plaintiff dropped out of mainstream education altogether, resigning herself to a data entry job with her only educational qualifications – an ‘O’ level certificate from an earlier time when she had fuller faculties. The multiplicands used for each of these cases were clearly appropriate given the competitive disadvantage that the plaintiffs would <em>actually</em> face. Compared to that – and <em>only</em> in comparison – the Plaintiff’s competitive disadvantage is relatively mild.</a></p><a id="p1_152"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a><a id="p1_153">153&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking all this together, I find that the Plaintiff’s loss of earning capacity (at least with regard to the first type of competitive disadvantage) would be $6,000 x 11 = $66,000.</a></p><a id="p1_153"> <p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Second Type of Competitive Disadvantage </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a><a id="p1_154">154&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This refers to the risk that the Plaintiff would lose his present job and be thrust into the open labour market, having to compete against his more able-bodied peers (see [89] above). In my view, only a small sum ought to be awarded for this given that it would be a one-time event, and given that the Plaintiff may well be competing for office-based jobs where his disabilities will not pose a serious interference with his work. $4,000, bringing the total LEC award to a round $70,000, ought to suffice.</a></p><a id="p1_154"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a><a id="p1_155">155&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sum, I assess damages at $356,153.1 and will hear parties on costs.
