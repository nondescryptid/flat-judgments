The plaintiff entered it with Ms. Florensia Leovanny Liong (the “<b>1<sup>st</sup> defendant</b>”), Mr Tan Tor Teng Jerome (the “<b>2<sup>nd</sup> defendant</b>”), and Mr Patrick Chong Tah Lick (the “<b>3<sup>rd</sup> defendant</b>”). The joint venture was for the purchase (and subsequent sale) of a property at B30-2 Tower B, South Bay Plaza, Penang, Malaysia (the “<b>Property</b>”). In furtherance to the joint venture, the plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant took a loan from HSBC Bank Malaysia Berhad (“<b>HSBC</b>”) to finance the purchase of the Property (the “<b>HSBC Loan</b>”).</a></p><a id="p1_2"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2016, disagreements emerged between the plaintiff and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. The plaintiff claimed that this eventually led to all four parties agreeing on 4 December 2017 for him to exit the joint venture (the “<b>alleged Exit Agreement</b>”) and for, amongst other things, the three defendants to continue servicing the mortgage of the Property and to reimburse him for his initial outlay for the Property.</a></p><a id="p1_3"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff also claimed that the defendants breached the alleged Exit Agreement by failing to service the HSBC Loan. This led to HSBC auctioning the Property, applying the sales proceeds to the HSBC Loan, and suing the plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant for the balance.</a></p><a id="p1_4"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff sued for an indemnity and/or damages to be assessed.</a></p><a id="p1_5"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the trial on 23 June 2022 and 5 July 2022. Only the plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant attended. They exchanged written closing submissions on 26 August 2022 and made oral reply submissions on 23 September 2022. After considering the evidence and their submissions, I dismissed the plaintiff’s claim against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. I also fixed costs at S$15,000 plus GST and reasonable disbursements to be paid by the plaintiff to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</a></p><a id="p1_6"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants,</a></p><a id="p1_7"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_7-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff sought no order against the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.

In this respect, the plaintiff’s counsel submitted that he had already obtained judgment against the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant for the reimbursement of his initial outlay for the Property, and as such, he was only seeking judgment for the outstanding sum under the HSBC Loan.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a> I acceded to the plaintiff’s request. Pursuant to ROC 2014, O&nbsp;35, r 1(2), I gave final judgment to the plaintiff for the sum of RM637,227.15 with interest fixed at 5.33% to run from the date of writ to judgment. Costs was fixed at S$8,000 (all in) plus GST to be paid by the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant to the plaintiff.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff has appealed against my decision to dismiss his claim against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.

The parties to the oral JV Agreement were the plaintiff and all three defendants. The net effect of the oral JV Agreement was that the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant joined the joint venture and undertook the obligations under the written JV Agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broadly speaking, the net effect of the written JV Agreement and the oral JV Agreement (collectively, the “<b>JV Agreement</b>”) was that all four parties joined the joint venture to invest in the Property. The terms of the joint venture were largely found in the written JV Agreement save for the parties’ respective share in the joint venture. Under the oral JV Agreement, it was agreed that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had a 50% share in the investment and the other parties had a 16.667% share in the investment.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a> I will refer to the terms of the JV Agreement later in my judgment, if necessary.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1 March 2013, the plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant took the HSBC Loan for the purchase of the Property.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a> The parties serviced the HSBC Loan by making payments into a HSBC Account No XXX (the “<b>HSBC Account</b>”).

Suffice to state, the plaintiff sought to leave the joint venture because of this dispute. To that end, the following correspondence, amongst others, was exchanged:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On or around 3 October 2016, the plaintiff sent a letter to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant titled “HANDING OVER OF ITEMS AND DOCUMENTS FOR SOUTHBAY PLAZA B-30-2, TOWER B”. The letter listed various items which the plaintiff wanted to handover to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. The letter also purported to set out the following “<em>T&amp;Cs in relation to the three [defendants] taking over [of the plaintiff’s] shares of the property”</em>:<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">This letter also serves to inform you that we had agreed on 27 Oct on the following T&amp;Cs in relation to the three of you taking over my shares of the property:</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All legal and finance costs related to this will be shared equally by all 4 investors</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall be refunded for whatever money I had paid up for this investment till 3 Oct 2016.</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount to refund me is $17,145.1.

My analysis together with the full text of these emails are set out at [52] below. For now, it suffices to summarise these emails:</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_16-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 27 November 2017, the plaintiff sent an email to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, copying the other two defendants. In that email, the plaintiff referred to an SMS from the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant on the topping up of the HSBC Account. He refused to do so. In support, the plaintiff referred to “<em>the series of events that had taken place over the past years</em>”, his agreement with the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, and asserted that he was “<em>already out of this partnership from that point</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 4 December 2017, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant replied, copying the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants. He confirmed the contents of the plaintiff’s 27 November 2017 email and stated that the plaintiff “<em>will not be liable for any losses or have any share if there is a profit from the sale of this property.

The High Court observed that permitting the application would result in “<em>changing the narrative completely by saying that the oral agreement materialized several months later than the original pleaded date.”</em> This would prejudice the appellant-defendant because he had always ran his defence based on an oral agreement in November 2018:</a></p><a id="p1_36"> </a><p class="Judg-Quote-1"><a id="p1_36"> <b>51</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>I dismiss this application.

This is illustrated from the reliefs the plaintiff sought. Thus, while it might be possible for the plaintiff to sue for damages and an indemnity pursuant to clause 11.1 of the written JV Agreement (a point that the plaintiff did not advance and which I did not decide), he could not for the S$27,309.25 refund. The JV Agreement has no provision to support this claim. Thus, this claim is possible only if the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was a party to the alleged Exit Agreement. And indeed, as the plaintiff’s counsel confirmed, the plaintiff’s entire case was premised on the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant being a party to the alleged Exit Agreement (see [31] above).</a></p><a id="p1_48"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a><a id="p1_49">49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my judgment, however, the most that the plaintiff could establish was that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant accepted that the plaintiff had left the joint venture.

This submission was completely unmeritorious. First, nowhere in the pleadings or evidence was it even suggested that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had the authority (whether actual or ostensible) to enter into agreements for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. Second, nowhere on the face of the 4 December 2017 email was it stated that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was doing so. Indeed, the point was not even advanced in the plaintiff’s written closing submissions.
