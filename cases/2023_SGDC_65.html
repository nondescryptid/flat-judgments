(2008 Revised Edition) (“<b>MDA</b>”) for having in his possession without authorisation a Class A Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA. The particulars of the offence were that on 25 May 2020, at about 1 am, in MacRitchie Reservoir Park, Singapore, he was found with one packet containing not less than 0.34 grams of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.23 grams of methamphetamine.</a></p><a id="p1_1"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the plead guilty mention, the accused was represented by his counsel, Mr Derek Wong, who requested the court to call for a probation suitability report or, alternatively, to impose a sentence of six months’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_2"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution, represented by Deputy Public Prosecutor (“DPP”) Ong Xin Jie, objected to the calling of a probation suitability report, and submitted for the imposition of a sentence of six to nine months’ imprisonment instead.</a></p><a id="p1_3"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having assessed the facts of the case, the authorities cited and the arguments presented by parties, I was of the view that a sentence of six months’ imprisonment was appropriate and I sentenced the accused accordingly.

As the two police officers approached the Mushroom Café which was located within MacRitchie Reservoir Park, they spotted the accused walking out of the café toilet. The two officers then proceeded to conduct a frisk search on the accused. During this search, a small transparent Ziploc bag containing an unknown white powdery crystalline substance fell out of the accused’s pants pocket.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused was subsequently arrested and brought to Police Cantonment Complex for further investigations. The small transparent Ziploc bag containing an unknown white powdery crystalline substance that fell out of the accused’s pocket was seized as a case exhibit. It was sealed in a tamper-proof bag and marked “S-01”.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 29 May 2020, exhibit “S-01” was submitted to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA") for analysis. On 17 June 2020, Dr Zhang Shuhua, an Analyst at the HSA Illicit Drugs Laboratory issued a Certificate No. ID-2032-00876-002 (“Certificate”) under Section 16 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”). The Certificate states that the exhibit “S-01” was found to be one packet containing not less than 0.34 gram of crystalline substance which was pulverized and homogenized into a powdery substance. The powdery substance was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.23 gram of methamphetamine.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Methamphetamine is a Class A Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule of the MDA. The accused is not authorised under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to possess a Controlled Drug. The accused has thereby committed an offence under Section 8(a) of the MDA and punishable under Section 33(1) of the MDA.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused admits to the offence and stands charged accordingly.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prescribed Penalty</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prescribed punishment for an offence under section 8(a) punishable under section 33(1) of the of the MDA is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, or a fine of $20,000, or both.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Antecedents</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused was untraced.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution tendered sentencing submissions urging the court to impose a sentence of between six to nine months’ imprisonment.

The main points put forward by the Defence are summarised below.</a></p><a id="p1_11"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the onset, the Defence highlighted the family and medical circumstances of the accused, including the following considerations:</a></p><a id="p1_12"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_12-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused grew up in a “tumultuous household”, with his parents eventually divorcing, a factor which affected his mental health. He was hospitalised in September 2013 due to acts of self-harm, and assessed by Dr Lui Yi Shiang (“<b>Dr Lui</b>”), to be “…experiencing dysthymic mood disorder with an emotionally unstable personality type. He reported frequent impulsive suicide thinking whenever he met with difficult interpersonal situations.”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused was also affected by his then-partner’s abuse of alcohol and tobacco in 2013, as well as by the demise of his grandparent, his father’s cancer diagnosis, his own medical exemption from military duty and his unemployment, all of which occurred in 2015. These factors caused him to suffer an exacerbation of his unstable mood states and resulted in suicidal thinking. The accused sought further medical help from Dr Lui and was recommended for antidepressant therapy. He also took active steps to seek counselling from the Samaritans of Singapore.</a></p><a id="p1_12-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_12-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused subsequently made his first suicide attempt in 2019, and was admitted to a hospital and then referred to a psychiatrist. Later that same year, his acquaintances introduced him to methamphetamine as a way to cope with his depression and anxiety. This began his “occasional use of the drug as a means of self-medication.” It was only after his arrest in June 2020 that he was officially diagnosed with Major Depression Disorder, Dysthymia, Borderline Personality Traits, Generalised Anxiety Disorder and recurrent suicidal ideation. After further consultation with Dr Lui, the latter “reported that a safe environment, participation in group activity and socialisation with other patients had helped the Accused considerably.”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counsel submitted that the conditions of the accused’s life and mental state, as well as his being led astray by bad company, made him believe that partaking in such an illicit substance would provide him an escape from his problems. In this regard, Dr Guo Song (“<b>Dr Guo</b>”) of the Institute of Mental Health (“<b>IMH</b>”) had assessed that the accused was likely suffering from a relapse of his depressive symptoms at the time of his arrest. Further, Dr Charles Mak (“<b>Dr Charles</b>”) of IMH had also reported that there may have been a contributory link between the accused’s Major Depression, which may have impacted upon his judgment and decision-making, particularly involving his consumption of methamphetamine. Counsel also argued that the very low quantity of methamphetamine in the accused’s possession, was consistent with the understanding that the drug found on the accused was for self-consumption.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, counsel argued that there were various factors, summarised below, that would support the calling of a probation suitability report:</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_14-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no statutory age limit for the imposition of probation. Further, in the case of <em>Kanagaratnam Nicholas Jens v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23994-SSP.xml')">[2019] 5 SLR 887</a> (“<b><em>Kanagaratnam</em></b>”), while it was recognised that the general sentencing consideration for drug offences involving older offenders is deterrence, rehabilitation may be the dominant sentencing consideration in a “purely exceptional case”, such as where an offender could prove that he was suffering from a psychiatric or other condition that was in some way causally related to the drug offence (see also [7] of <em>Alvin Lim</em>). In the present case, the accused’s mental state ought to be taken to have caused him to make sub-optimal choices which led to his commission of the offence. Further, he has no antecedents, and his offending behaviour was one-off and not premeditated.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, it was highlighted that the courts in <em>Public Prosecutor v Lim Chee Yin Jordan</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22299-SSP.xml')">[2018] 4 SLR 1294</a> (“<b><em>Jordan</em></b>”) at [34], and <em>A Karthik v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22640-SSP.xml')">[2018] 5 SLR 1289</a>( “<b><em>Karthik</em></b>”) at [44], had held that for offenders above the age of 21 years at both the time of the offence and the time of sentencing, it was required that “the offender demonstrate an extremely strong propensity for reform or there exist other exceptional circumstances” for the law to take the view that rehabilitation would be the operative concern. In the present case, it was argued that based on the contents of the Progress Report, which was a document prepared by a voluntary welfare organisation for the accused’s case (the “<b>Progress Report</b>”), the accused has demonstrated an extremely strong propensity for reform as he has voluntarily subjected himself to numerous regular urine drug screenings throughout the two years with negative results. Further, most recently on 6 January 2023, Dr Charles, had noted that the accused has continued to do well in recovery, with a complete abstinence from illicit drug use.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the accused has made a significant effort to rehabilitate himself, by his active and voluntary participation in counselling and support groups, for a period lasting more than 2 years. As noted in the Progress Report, since the accused’s arrest, he has had zero contract with the acquaintances who had given him drugs. He had also actively sought out and built for himself a strong network of health and social support. Prior to his arrest, he was employed as a safe distancing ambassador and had participated in active volunteering for the benefit of others. The accused was presently gainful employed as a customer service officer of People Advantage Pte Ltd.</a></p><a id="p1_14-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_14-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counsel also highlighted that the fear and distress caused by potential incarceration for his present offence, has caused the accused’s mental state to deteriorate further. In this regard, most recently on 27 January 2023, facing the fear and distress of being sentenced to incarceration, the accused had attempted to take his own life, thus causing Dr Charles to adjust his medication for depression.</a></p><a id="p1_14-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_14-p2_e">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such intense fear and distress was also demonstrated by the accused during his eight-day detention in the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC), which was a highly traumatic experience for him. This was in contrast to his six-day inpatient stay at the National University Hospital (“<b>NUH</b>”), where he had demonstrated a remarkable improvement in his mood symptoms.</a></p><a id="p1_14-p2_e"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14-p2_e"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counsel further argued that calling for a probation suitability report was in line with the three-limb framework in <em>Public Prosecutor v Siow Kai Yuan Terence</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25125-SSP.xml')">[2020] 4 SLR 1412</a> (“<b><em>Terence Siow</em></b>”), reiterating that:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused here has taken remarkable steps post-offence towards reform (first limb) as he has been attending monthly voluntary urine testing at IMH for over 2 years and has stayed drug free for 2 years, 7 months and 19 days. The accused has also voluntarily attended counseling and support groups. In addition, he took up full-time employment as a healthcare attendant in October 2022, and subsequently as a customer service officer at People Advantage Pte Ltd from 1st March 2023.</a></p><a id="p1_15-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_15-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused also has strong external factors motivating him to reform (second limb) in that he was the sole caregiver of his father, and was successfully holding down a full-time job as a customer service officer. Further, his family is supportive of him.</a></p><a id="p1_15-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_15-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the risk factors (third limb), although the accused has faced worsening mental health, and had even made a recent suicide attempt, he continued to stay away from illicit substances, and has demonstrated the ability to steer clear of his past habits, and to remain on track to a reformed life.</a></p><a id="p1_15-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, counsel sought to distinguish cases involving adult offenders, such as <em>Kanagaratnam</em>, where probation was not granted to the offender, repeatedly arguing that the quantity of illicit drugs that the accused was in possession of in the present case was significantly insubstantial, and highlighting the actions the accused has since taken to rehabilitate and reform himself. These actions, he argued “…clearly demonstrate that the (a)ccused had truly used the illicit drug to cope with his underlying psychiatric conditions.”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as an alternative to the calling of a probation suitability report, counsel submitted that in line with the decision of the High Court in <em>Dinesh Singh</em>, which held that the sentencing range for a first offender who was charged with the possession of a Class A controlled drug was a term of imprisonment of between six and 18 months, the Prosecution’s sentencing range of six and nine months imprisonment should be adopted. In calibrating the final sentence, he argued that the accused has shown genuine remorse for his actions and was committed to never re-offend. Further, the accused has chosen to plead guilty, has at all times cooperated with the authorities, and has also taken significant steps to rehabilitate and reform himself, including by immediately subjecting himself to drug testing and seeking help on his own accord through joining counselling and support groups. He also has had regular appointments with Dr Charles at IMH.</a></p><a id="p1_17"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, in conclusion, counsel submitted that “(i)n view of the facts of the case and the factors as highlighted above, the Defence humbly submits that a global sentence of <b><u>6 months’ imprisonment</u></b> would be appropriate.” <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Further replies<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the mitigation plea, the Prosecution highlighted that from the various cases cited by the Defence, it was clear that the age of the offender was a critical factor in the court’s determination of whether an offender should be granted probation. In this regard, the cases do not lend weight to counsel’s submission that probation was suitable in the present case, since the accused was an adult offender who was 26 years old at the time of committing the offence, and he was also 29 years old at the time of sentencing.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DPP further highlighted that it was stated in <em>Kanagaratnam</em> at [19] that the dominant sentencing consideration for older offenders is deterrence, and rehabilitation would only apply “in a purely exceptional case”, where the offender could prove that he was suffering from a psychiatric or other condition that was, in some way causally related to his offence. In the present case, based on the IMH report tendered by the Defence, there was no causal link between the accused’s mental health condition and his offence, or even a contributory link between his major depression and the drug possession charge that was proceeded with. At best, any possible contributory link was only between the accused’s psychiatric condition of depression and his drug consumption, but as regards drug possession, which was the actual charge proceeded with, there was no causal link and also no contributory link established.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution further referred to Dr Lui’s report dated 6th of November 2020, which was included as part of the supporting documents tendered by the Defence in support of his mitigation plea. In this regard, while counsel had asserted that the accused was not involved in any sale of drugs, it was stated at [6] of Dr Lui’s report that the accused subsequently found himself having to consume drugs, and even admitted that he had aided in its sales, albeit he said that he did so because these friends had threatened to soil his reputation by posting his nude pictures online otherwise. Nonetheless, the accused’s admission that he had aided in the sale of drugs was contrary to counsel’s claim that the accused was not involved in drug sales at all.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the accused’s own account was that he was involved in the sale and consumption of drugs in 2019. This was even before the commission of present drug possession offence which occurred in 2020. Thus, the Prosecution argued that while the accused was presently only being prosecuted for drug possession, he was in fact not a first offender.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the Prosecution argued that deterrence must remain the dominant sentencing consideration as the accused was an adult offender and the calling of a probation suitability report would be inappropriate, considering that there was no contributory or causal link between his mental condition and the offence of drug possession. Instead, an imprisonment term was warranted.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Defence, in response to matters brought up in the Prosecution’s reply, counsel contested the point made by the Prosecution that the there was no contributory link found between the accused’s psychiatric condition and the offence of drug possession. Nonetheless, counsel accepted that there was no causal connection shown between the accused’s psychiatric condition and the offence.</a></p><a id="p1_24"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The applicable sentencing principle and why probation was not appropriate</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will first set out the appropriate sentencing principles applicable to cases involving adult offenders. I will then consider whether it was even appropriate to consider probation or to call for a probation suitability report in this case.</a></p><a id="p1_25"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the onset, I would highlight that it is trite law that rehabilitation is generally not the dominant sentencing consideration for offenders who are above 21 years old. This principle was recently reaffirmed by Sundaresh Menon CJ in <em>Terence Siow</em>, a case cited by the Defence.</a></p><a id="p1_26"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Terence Siow</em>, the offender was a 23-year-old male who had pleaded guilty to one charge of outraging a victim’s modesty, an offence committed when he was 22 years old.

Thus, for offences of outrage of modesty committed by an adult offender, as was the case in <em>Terence Siow</em>, Menon CJ stated at [43] and [44] that for such cases, unless the offender “…is able to demonstrate an extremely strong propensity for reform or that there are exceptional circumstances, a sentence that places emphasis on deterrence would be appropriate”.</a></p><a id="p1_30"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for whether a particular adult offender could be said to have demonstrated an extremely strong propensity for reform, such that rehabilitation may displace deterrence as the dominant sentencing consideration, Menon CJ in <em>Terence Siow</em> set out a three-limbed framework for the courts to apply (see [55] – [58]).

Further, as the offence was committed on 25<sup>th</sup> May 2020, the accused was almost 27 years old by that time, as his date of birth (as stated in the charge) was 14<sup>th</sup> June 1993. Thus, clearly the accused should be dealt with based on principles that normally apply to an adult offender. Accordingly, rehabilitation was <em>prima facie</em> not the dominant sentencing principle in his case.</a></p><a id="p1_34-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_34-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the offence that the accused had committed was that of possession of an illicit drug. In this regard, Menon CJ had also earlier made it clear at [7] of <em>Alvin Lim</em>, a case also involving an adult offender convicted of drug possession, that in the context of drug offences “….the law is clear that deterrence is the dominant consideration, and save for the “purely exceptional case”, a custodial term is usually warranted: <em>Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2005] 3 SLR(R) 0001.xml')">[2005] 3 SLR(R) 1</a> (“<em>Dinesh Singh</em>”) at [59] ….”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, as with <em>Terence Siow</em>, <b><em>the accused here would have to show </em></b><em>that he had </em><b><em><u>an extremely strong propensit</u></em></b><b><u>y</u></b> for reform. Even if he was able to establish this, “…it remains necessary and relevant for the court to consider the gravity of the offence as the final step in the analysis.

I elaborate below.</a></p><a id="p1_36"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the first limb of the framework in <em>Terence Siow</em> i.e. the presence of evidence of a positive desire to change, I noted the following:</a></p><a id="p1_37"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37"></a><a id="p1_37-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this issue, the factors that could be said to be in the accused’s favour included his plea of guilt, the steps he has taken to leave his errant ways behind him including his taking part in various positive voluntary activities, his compliance with the urine test regime, the fact that he has not since re-offended, and also his clean record. Many of these factors were repeatedly emphasised in the Progress Report, which was put up by counsel to argue for probation to be granted to the accused.</a></p><a id="p1_37-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_37-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence also highlighted the fact that the accused was identified as suffering from mental health issues when he was assessed in 2013 and 2015 at the NUH. However, in my view, it was on this last point, <em>viz</em>, his mental health issues and more importantly, the related effect that these issues may have had on the accused’s commission of the offence, as well as the steps that the accused had taken (or failed to take) to address his mental health issues, that were of particular relevance. This was particular so as evidence of his prior behaviour was a useful indicator for assessing the veracity and reliability of claims made by the Defence pertaining to the accused’s desire to change.</a></p><a id="p1_37-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_37-p2_b-p3_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, while the Progress Report, prepared in support of his counsel’s mitigation plea, had made much of the measures that the accused had recently taken before his plea of guilt and sentencing took place, which the Defence argued was indicative of his positive desire to change, the accused’s actual actions in the past, after he was already aware of his mental health issues, were a lot less reassuring, as was some of his actions after the offence. Amongst other things, the latter could be seen from the information recorded in Dr Lui’s report that was included in the mitigation plea, and which was also referred to by the Prosecution in arguing against probation.</a></p><a id="p1_37-p2_b-p3_i"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_37-p2_b-p3_i"></a><a id="p1_37-p2_b-p3_ii">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin, the accused was reported to have gone to NUH as early as 2013 to seek treatment. However, he did not follow up subsequently after his one visit in October 2013. Even when he returned for an outpatient review in January 2015, following a series of reported life events and he was assessed to be suffering from grief reaction, the accused again did not return for further mental health visits in February and March 2015. Nor did he attempt to rebook any mental health visits.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_37-p2_b-p3_iii">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was only on 19<sup>th</sup> June 2020, after the commission of the present offence, that he was brought to NUH Emergency by a social worker in view of his intensifying suicide urges. While the accused reported a remarkable improvement in his mood symptoms during the inpatient stay for six days, I note that the accused subsequently declined to consider the suggestion of the medical social worker, who was attempting to engage him, to consider drug counselling. <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_37-p2_b-p3_iv">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, it was noted at [8] of Dr Lui’s report that the accused was scheduled to return for a review in October 2020 (which was after the commission of the offence). However, Dr Lui opined that:</a></p><a id="p1_37-p2_b-p3_iv"> <p class="Judg-Quote-3"> <b><em>It is uncertain if [the accused] would adhere to treatment </em></b> <b><em><u>as historically he had not demonstrated so.</u></em></b> The abovementioned acknowledged his mental health condition and would solicit assistance for his problem, but <b><em>appeared to have difficulty accepting he would require treatment</em></b>”.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"></p><div align="right">[emphasis added]</div><p></p> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_b-p3_iv"></a><a id="p1_37-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was thus concerned about the evidence of the accused’s lack of desire or follow up with the repeated efforts by the hospital and the medical social worker, both pre and post offence, to help him through treatment and counselling to cope with his mental health issues, and with his related drug association. My concern was particularly with the fact that the accused had admitted to a medical officer at NUH that “his involvement with illicit substance was only since 2019 when he was approached by friends who advised him to use methamphetamine to relieve his mental health problems” <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a>. Yet, the accused had apparently not made serious efforts, to deal with the mental health problems that were so intimately connected with his drug related offence, and which continue to be of concern. In fact, as noted above, even Dr Lui, who assessed the accused, had concerns over the accused’s future adherence to treatment.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, while the accused had apparently since sought help from IMH prior to sentencing, his past history of a lack of follow through, as well as his subsequent reaction, post offence, to the suggestion of the medical social worker on drug counselling as indicated in Dr Lui’s report, made his claim of a positive desire to change somewhat less convincing. In this regard, while the first limb was primarily concerned with behaviour post commission of his offence, and I have indeed considered aspects of his behaviour and attitude since the offence, actual evidence of his previous lack of determination or desire to deal with the underlying mental health issues, which were of importance since they had brought about his drug association from 2019 onwards, could not be ignored, especially as these same issues may continue to feature in the future.</a></p><a id="p1_37-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_37-p2_e">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separately, it was also indicated in Dr Lui’s report that following the “advice” of his friends given in 2019 to use methamphetamine to cope with his mental health issues, not only did the accused then go on to consume the drug, he also proceeded to aid in its sale, albeit apparently after his friends threatened to soil his reputation if he did not do so (see [6] of Dr Lui’s report). As alluded to by the Prosecution, this evidence went against the claim made by his counsel that the accused was not involved in the sale of drugs. While not directly relevant to the present charge of drug possession, such actions on the accused’s part – contrary to earlier claims made by the Defence that he had not been involved in any drug sales - certainly did not help his case, especially as they suggested that the accused may have been less forthcoming, candid or frank about the extent of his previous drug involvement, than was otherwise presented by the Defence.</a></p><a id="p1_37-p2_e"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_e"></a><a id="p1_37-p2_f">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such apparent denial and downplaying of his previous drug association, post offence, further contradicted the Defence’s claim that the accused had manifested a positive desire to change after he was caught in possession of the illicit drugs.</a></p><a id="p1_37-p2_f"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_f"></a><a id="p1_37-p2_g">(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Progress Report also highlighted, amongst other things, the accused’s stress and anxieties over his court case, his recent suicide attempts, as well as his fear over his potential imprisonment, it should be noted that in <em>Terence Siow</em> at [75(c)], Menon CJ noted that “(s)uch situational anxiety, while common, is generally not a relevant sentencing consideration…and certainly does not go towards demonstrating a positive desire to change.”</a></p><a id="p1_37-p2_g"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_g"></a><a id="p1_37-p2_h">(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I would add that if the accused’s ways of coping with pressure, anxiety and mental health issues were through acts of self-harm (carried out both before and after the commission of the present offence), or through the use of illicit drugs, rather than through treatment and counselling that he was offered and which was made available to him, not only did the accused’s actions not demonstrate a strong desire for change, they could arguably even suggest that incarceration to ensure his mandatory compliance with treatment for his mental health issues, and/or with mandatory drug counselling to dissuade him from further drug offences, may be a more effective way to effect change for the better. This would be consistent with the approach adopted in <em>Public Prosecutor v Kong Peng Yee</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22064-SSP.xml')">[2018] 2 SLR 295</a> at [100], where the court also considered that a 6-year imprisonment term would give the offender “sufficient time to become accustomed to the new reality of having to take medication in a disciplined manner.”.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, while the Progress Report also set out a number of legal arguments and cited a number of legal authorities to support the recommendation for probation to be granted to the accused, and the writer of the Progress Report also indicated that the accused had repeatedly tested negative in his urine tests, there was in fact information contained in some of the annexes to the Progress Report that presented matters of concern. This was so even though these same matters were not highlighted in the body of the Progress Report, or in the mitigation plea. Amongst other things, these matters included the following facts:</a></p><a id="p1_37-p2_i"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_37-p2_i"></a><a id="p1_37-p2_i-p3_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the accused was consuming methamphetamine from Jan to June 2019 (see Annex A to Progress Report). Such extent of his previous drug involvement was noteworthy, since his current drug possession charge was only in respect of an offence detected in May 2020;</a></p><a id="p1_37-p2_i-p3_i"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_37-p2_i-p3_i"></a><a id="p1_37-p2_i-p3_ii">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while there may have been a contributory link between his major depression and his consumption of drugs (as opposed to his offence of drug possession for which he was charged), more importantly, it was made clear by two doctors who saw the accused, <em>viz</em>, Dr Guo and Dr Charles, that this <em>did not amount</em> to a causal link between his condition and his drug offence (see Annex B to Progress Report); and</a></p><a id="p1_37-p2_i-p3_ii"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_37-p2_i-p3_ii"></a><a id="p1_37-p2_i-p3_iii">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it was indicated in the IMH document put up by Dr Charles that the accused had maintained “innocence for his part in the case but his lawyer has advised him to plead guilty” (see Annex C to Progress Report).</a></p><a id="p1_37-p2_i-p3_iii"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_i-p3_iii"></a><a id="p1_37-p2_j">(j)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would add that this last revelation in Annex C, which was again a post-offence event, further cast serious doubts as to any claims of genuine remorse, co-operation and/or contriteness on the accused’s part. It also called into question whether the assertion made of the accused’s positive desire to change was genuine, especially when one considers that the accused may not even have been sincere in his admission to wrongdoing.</a></p><a id="p1_37-p2_j"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_j"></a><a id="p1_37-p2_k">(k)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, based on the factors set out in the first limb of <em>Terence Siow</em>, and similar to the finding made in that case, “I cannot say with conviction that the [accused] makes out a very strong case for displacing deterrence as the dominant sentencing consideration” (echoing the words of Menon CJ at [76] of <em>Terence Siow</em>).</a></p><a id="p1_37-p2_k"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37-p2_k"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to the second limb, which involves a consideration of the environmental factors, I was respectfully of the view that these factors were also largely not in the accused’s favour.</a></p><a id="p1_38"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38"></a><a id="p1_38-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one, there was no evidence of any familial support such as from a parent, or from siblings, which could possibly have provided motivation, encouragement or a firm foundation for his reform efforts. Further, even though the accused apparently did seek help from medical professionals and even had a medical social worker assigned to him, as stated above, it does not appear that he would always listen to them (as shown, for example, when he rejected the advice of the medical social worker concerning drug counselling). In addition, the accused’s dealings with them appear to be voluntary, and largely only took place after the discovery of the offence and before his sentencing, even though his mental health problems and his association with drugs had occurred well before that. Hence, moving forward, there was some doubt about placing reliance on such rather arbitrary, voluntary and limited environmental support from the medical or social workers in the future.</a></p><a id="p1_38-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_38-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, despite alluding to the support that religion and a long-term girlfriend could possibly provide for the accused, there was nothing concrete put forward in the Progress Report, or by counsel, to show how these factors would firmly ground the accused in his reform efforts.</a></p><a id="p1_38-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_38-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to a consideration of his possible motivation for reform, counsel cited the need for the accused to take care of his ailing father, and argued that his role as a caregiver was a factor in the accused’s favour. However, it should be noted that the cancer diagnosis of his father was in 2015, while the accused’s own dealings with drugs occurred in 2019 (according to Dr Lui’s report), and in 2020 (the present charge). Thus, his father’s condition and the accused’s role as a caregiver, had apparently not helped him in preventing or discouraging him from his drug involvement in the past. Further, the accused’s various suicide attempts, including the most recent one in 2023, had taken place despite the supposed need for the accused to provide caregiver support to his father. Clearly, despite the apparently dire health condition of his father, and the accused’s purported role as the sole caregiver of his father, these circumstances and responsibility have neither prevented the accused in the commission of his drug offence, nor have they even prevented the accused’s own attempts at self-harm. In short, there was already doubt as to whether the accused could take care of himself, let alone take (sole) care of his father. All in all, there was no real evidence of any motivation for reform on the accused’s part supposedly just so that he could continue to take care of his father.</a></p><a id="p1_38-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_38-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the other relevant factor concerning the possible availability of positive avenues to channel the accused’s energies, counsel pointed to the fact that accused had taken up full time employment as a healthcare attendant in October 2022, after dedicated job-seeking efforts, and that the accused has now been offered, and had accepted, an appointment as a customer service officer at People Advantage Pte Ltd. These actions, counsel argued, were clear evidence that there have been positive improvements arising from his attendance at counselling and support groups in the last two years.</a></p><a id="p1_38-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_38-p2_e">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I had some hesitation in sharing counsel’s optimistic outlook as it was not explained why the accused had looked for a new job as a customer service officer in 2023, barely four or five months after he had started his employment as a healthcare attendant in October 2022, the latter being a role that the accused had supposedly (according to counsel) secured only after dedicated job-seeking efforts. This was especially so as there were also claims made in the Progress Report that the first full time job that the accused secured as a healthcare attendant in October 2022, was supposedly “a matter of great pride and comfort to him” Yet the fact was that the accused apparently left this coveted job only months later. While not a matter of particular relevance, such evidence could suggest an inability of the accused to commit himself to staying employed in a role that may have otherwise provided some degree of security and stability in his life, during which reform and positive changes could take place.</a></p><a id="p1_38-p2_e"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_e"></a><a id="p1_38-p2_f">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, <em><u>I was not satisfied</u></em> that the environmental factors supported the claim by the accused <u>that </u><em><u>he had shown </u></em><u>an </u><em><u>extremely strong </u></em><u>propensity for reform.</u></a></p><a id="p1_38-p2_f"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38-p2_f"></a><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of my views concerning the first and second limbs, it was clear that the accused has not demonstrated an extremely strong propensity for reform. There was thus no need to move on to the third limb and to consider whether there were risk factors that may cause the court to revisit its finding of any such a high capacity of reform, since I had clearly not made such a finding. That said, the risk factor pertaining to his mental health problems, discussed in [37(b)] to [37(e)], and [37(i)] above, continue to be a matter of concern, especially as evidenced by the accused’s recent suicide attempt in 2023, amongst other things. This would also have been detrimental to the accused’s case.</a></p><a id="p1_39"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a><a id="p1_40">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would end my analysis by repeating the words of Menon CJ at [60] of <em>Terence Siow</em> that “ … it remains necessary and relevant for the court to consider the gravity of the offence as the final step in the analysis. This is to determine whether, despite the offender’s extremely strong propensity for reform, it nonetheless remains appropriate in all the circumstances to retain the emphasis on deterrence.” In this regard, even if I had found that the accused had demonstrated an “extremely strong propensity for reform” (which I have not), I was of the view that in light of the nature of the offence, the circumstances of its commission, as well as the age of the accused at the time of the commission of the offence, and at the time of his sentencing, it nonetheless “… remains appropriate in all the circumstances to retain the emphasis on deterrence”. In short, a sentence of probation would not have been an appropriate punishment.</a></p><a id="p1_40"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a><a id="p1_41">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would add that probation was similarly not granted in <em>Kanagaratnam</em>, a case cited by both the Prosecution and the Defence, where Menon CJ had instead imposed a sentence of 10 months imprisonment on a 30-year-old male offender for possession of cannabis, even though the Defence had sought a sentence of probation on account of psychiatric conditions that the offender suffered from. In rejecting the submission for probation, Menon CJ also found that the Defence had not established a causal link between the accused’s psychiatric conditions and his offences (for drug possession and drug consumption), and held that the offender had not shown that rehabilitation should displace deterrence as the dominant sentencing consideration. I note that a causal connection, as conceded by the Defence, was also not established in the present case between any mental or psychiatric condition that the accused may suffer from, and his commission of the offence of drug possession.</a></p><a id="p1_41"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a><a id="p1_42">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all the reasons set out above, I have come to the same conclusion that was reached in <em>Terence Siow</em> and <em>Kanagaratnam</em>, as regards their respective offenders, that probation was inappropriate and should not be considered for the accused, an adult offender, in the present case.</a></p><a id="p1_42"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentences imposed</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a><a id="p1_43">43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having rejected the option of probation, I move on to consider what would be the appropriate sentence to impose in the present case.</a></p><a id="p1_43"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a><a id="p1_44">44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Menon CJ in <em>Alvin Lim</em> at [28] had endorsed the position set out in the earlier High Court decision in <em>Dinesh Singh</em>, that the appropriate sentence for a first offender who was charged with possession of a Class A controlled drug was a term of imprisonment of between six and 18 months.</a></p><a id="p1_44"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a><a id="p1_45">45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, the Prosecution suggested that a sentence ranging from six to nine months was appropriate, while the Defence submitted for an imprisonment term of six months’ imprisonment only.</a></p><a id="p1_45"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a><a id="p1_46">46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having regard to the factors put forward by parties, including the accused’s plea of guilt, the steps he has since taken post offence including his compliance with the urine test regime, the fact that he has since not re-offended, his clean record, and the relative small amount of illicit drug involved, I agreed with the Defence that a sentence of six months’ imprisonment, which was at the lowest end of the Prosecution’s suggested sentencing range, was a sufficient and proportionate punishment. This was the sentence I imposed. At the request of the Defence, I also agreed to defer the commencement of the sentence to 10<sup>th</sup> May 2023. The accused has since filed an appeal against sentence. He has been granted bail pending appeal.</a></p><a id="p1_46"> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"></a><p class="Footnote"><a id="p1_46"><sup></sup></a><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a>See [4] of Dr Lui’s report dated 6 November 2020, and the Mitigation-In-Plea at [9]</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>Mitigation-In-Plea at [14]</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>Mitigation-In-Plea at [36]</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>Mitigation-In-Plea at [56]</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_5_1" id="Ftn_5">[note: 5]</a></sup>Notes of Evidence (NE), 10 March 2023, 5/31-10/17</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_6_1" id="Ftn_6">[note: 6]</a></sup>See [4] and [5] of Dr Lui’s report dated 6 November 2020</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_7_1" id="Ftn_7">[note: 7]</a></sup>See [7] of Dr Lui’s report dated 6 November 2020</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_8_1" id="Ftn_8">[note: 8]</a></sup>See [6] of Dr Lui’s report dated 6 November 2020</p></div></content></html>
