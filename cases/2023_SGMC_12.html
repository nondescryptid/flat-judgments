Then, the Victim had gone for a traditional Chinese massage (“TCM”) at the TCM shop with her mother, PW2. This was the Victim’s first TCM massage<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a>. The Victim was assigned the accused as her masseur. This first massage proceeded without controversy, and they were both sufficiently satisfied to return to the TCM shop the following week. In fact, the Victim proceeded to book another session with the same masseur for the following week, for the same type of massage but longer in duration.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 3 November 2019, the Victim and PW2 returned to the TCM shop for their respective appointments. After informing the counter of their reservations, the Victim proceeded to the same area where she had received her massage the previous week. However, she was told that for a longer massage, she had to go to a private room.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a> She was then led to the massage room. However, she was unable to recall who brought her there. She was confused as to why the massage was to be done in a private room, but she did not enquire further. Her mother did not accompany her into the massage room.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The OM incident</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the massage room, the Victim laid prone on a bed, face down on her stomach. Her face was placed in a hole. She was wearing her own clothing, namely a spaghetti black top and denim shorts.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused began massaging the Victim. According to the Victim, about ten minutes into the massage, it appeared that the accused had some trouble with her bra strap as he had been fiddling with it for some time. She asked the accused whether he wanted her to take it off, but the accused didn’t reply. The Victim therefore unclasped her bra, allowing it to fall down towards the front as she was lying prone.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused then asked the Victim to turn over. She did so, and while she was doing so, she removed her bra and put it on a stool near her bag.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a> She then went back to the bed and laid back down on the bed, facing up.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Victim was then given a towel to cover her from her chest to slightly below her knee.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a> The accused then proceeded to massage the Victim from her neck to her shoulder and to her collarbone and further downwards. According to the Victim, the accused spent a lot of time on her shoulders before he moved down to the collarbone.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The massage was done with his bare hands.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At around this point, the accused asked the Victim whether she was married, to which she replied that she was not. The accused then told her that she had a blocked duct on her left breast and whether she wanted to unblock it. The Victim thought that this was a strange remark. She did not initially reply, but then told him that it was okay, meaning that she did not want it, and the accused then shifted to massaging the right side of the Victim’s body and massaged the same area.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused then proceeded to massage the side of her right breast, close to her armpits.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a> As he was doing so, the Victim felt the accused’s hand go under her blouse. She felt a bit uncomfortable, but she didn’t say anything. She only felt that the accused was out of line when she felt his bare palm brush against her nipple in what she felt like a squeeze.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The Victim was unable to remember the duration of the squeeze. She was confused as she did not know what to expect from a TCM massage when compared with a normal massage.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> She therefore gave the accused an excuse that it was a bit painful, and the accused withdrew his hand.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> There was no request from the accused, and neither was there any agreement for the accused to brush his palm over her nipple and then to squeeze her right breast. The accused also did not explain or acknowledge why he was pressing or squeezing the Victim’s breast.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the accused retracted his hand, he continued the massage. He went higher to where the collar bone was, and the massage ended with a massage to the head.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events after the OM incident</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the massage was done, the Victim put on her bra, took her things and met her mother outside as her mother had finished her massage earlier. PW2 made payment and they left the shop.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Victim’s reaction viz PW2</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was only after when they were on the way to the escalator did the Victim tell PW2, her mother, what had happened. PW2 asked her whether she was sure that the incident actually happened. The Victim replied, “<em>I think so and I feel very uncomfortable</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a> Her mother did not respond. Therefore the Victim proceeded to text PW5, her fiancé to tell him what happened, and she also called her sister, PW3. By now, the Victim had broken down and was crying.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> According to PW2, the Victim told her that the masseur had brushed the side of her breast and that the hand had touched her nipples. As the Victim had already called her sister, PW3, PW2 decided to leave the mall first because she was not feeling well.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Victim’s reaction viz PW3</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW3 remembered receiving a call from the Victim. The Victim was audibly shaken and sounded traumatised. She was crying and told her that she had been molested. Upon further questioning, the Victim told her that the masseur’s hands had, as she was lying face up during the massage, started going down nearer towards her chest. Then the Victim said that she felt his hand brush over her nipples and then his hands either “groped” or “squeezed” her breast. PW3 was unable to recall the exact word used by the Victim.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW3 then called her husband, PW4 and sked him to call the Police, which he did.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a> PW3 then went down to City Square Mall to be with the Victim.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW3 described how the Victim had changed since the incident. The Victim no longer wanted to go for massages, even if was just for foot reflexology. The Victim also refused to be touched by strangers and developed a clear distain of men of Chinese nationality to such an extent that she even refuses to purchase food from a stall if the stallholder is of Chinese nationality. The Victim is also now very jumpy when someone accidentally brushes or bumps into her.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Victim’s reaction viz PW5</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW5 is the Victim’s boyfriend. On the day of the incident, he received a text message from the Victim at about 1240 hours. For the next six minutes or so, the Victims sent PW5 a series of messages describing what had just happen to her. <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a> In her messages, she told PW5 that a male masseur had touched her breast and her nipple.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, in a phone call, the Victim told him that she had felt the palm of the masseur’s hand touch her nipple. From the tone of the Victim’s voice, he knew that she was upset. Feeling angry, he rode his motorbike from his workplace at Jurong West to City Square Mall. When he was with the Victim at City Square Mall, PW3, the Victim’s sister, PW4, the Victim’s brother-in-law and the police officers arrived at the scene.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Evidence of the PW6 and, PW7</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW7 was the duty officer of the Special Victim’s Unit at Central Police Division on the day in question.

He was informed of the Victim’s allegations and the uniformed officers point out the accused to him. Thereafter, he directed the police officers to place the accused under arrest.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, 4 November 2019, PW6 took over the case from PW7. He was the officer that took statements from the Victim, PW2, PW3, PW4 and PW5. He obtained the screen shot of the text messages between the Victim and PW5 as well as directing the police photographer to take photos of the Victim’s attire that day.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Submission at the close of the Prosecution’s case </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No submission was made by the accused at the close of the Prosecution’s case.</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, there was “ <em>…. some evidence which is not </em><b><em>inherently incredible</em></b>, <em>and which satisfies each and every element of the charge …</em>.”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a>. I therefore called upon the accused to enter his defence and administered the standard allocution. The accused elected to give evidence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Case for the Defence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused is a male masseuse and was employed by the TCM Shop at the material time. He had begun working at the TCM Shop sometime in March 2018 and stopped working sometime in April 2020, at the start of the circuit breaker.</a></p><a id="p1_26"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The massage appointment for 3 November 2019 was made by the Victim’s mother the previous day. He was informed of the customer’s arrival by the receptionist. Upon his arrival at the shop, he met the Victim at the counter and brought her into the room. PW2 was seated in one of the massage chairs.</a></p><a id="p1_27"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the massage room, he handed the Victim a pair of blue shorts and left the room. When the Victim had finished changing, he re-entered the room. He asked the Victim to lie face down on the massage bed. As the Victim told him that she felt uncomfortable in her shoulders, he began to examine the area by pressing on her collarbone area to determine where it was painful. He then began the massage.</a></p><a id="p1_28"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he was massaging her back, he found that that her bra strap was causing obstruction. He then lowered the strap a little to ensure that the strap would not obstruct the massage. The Victim did not take out her bra but instead, she loosened it.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about 10 minutes, he asked the Victim to sit up. She complained about feeling pain at both sides of her neck. The pain was on both sides of her collarbone, near her shoulder. He then asked her to lie back down on the massage bed, this time, on her back. He then started massaging her neck, and then around her collarbone, including the area below the collarbone, near the shoulder.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the accused, when he began to massage the right side of the Victim, he realised that the right side was more “serious” than the left as the Victim felt more pain. She told him that she also felt pain in her armpit. The accused therefore asked the Victim to raise her right arm in such a way that her right hand was behind her head. He then used his right thumb to press the Victim’s right armpit, seeking permission before he did so. At this time, the Victim asked him whether there were lumps in her breast to which he replied that that it was not possible because she was young.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a> After this, he started to massage the back of her neck and helped her to relax her muscles. After helping her relax her muscles, he started massaging her head and then her abdomen. By this time, it was already about an hour and the time was almost up</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the time for the massage was up, the accused left the massage room and closed the door. The Victim came out about 10 minutes later. The accused served her some tea. The accused noted that PW2 had given him a SGD10 tip. The Victim then said, “thank you” and walked out of the shop. The accused went back to tidy the massage room. And went to rest at the rest area thereafter. Where he later received a call from the receptionist informing him that the next customer was ready.</a></p><a id="p1_32"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The applicable legal principles</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with most cases of this nature, it essentially the evidence of a victim, against that of the accused.

In other words, if the evidence of the complainant is not “unusually convincing”, the conviction on the sole basis of the complainant’s testimony would be unsafe (see: <em>Haliffie bin Mamat v Public Prosecutor and other appeals</em> [2016] SLR 636 at [30] (“<em>Haliffie</em>”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term “unusually convincing” was explained by the Court of Appeal in <em>PP v Mohammed Liton Muhammed Syeed Mallik</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 1 SLR(R) 0601.xml')">[2008] 1 SLR(R) 601</a> at [39] as –</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <em>“… In our view, therefore, the “extra something’ implied by the word “unusually” must refer to the need for the trial judge to be aware of the dangers of convicting solely on the complainant’s testimony as well as of the importance of convicting only on testimony that</em>, <b><em>when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused</em></b><em>.”</em></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(Emphasis added)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A trial judge evaluates whether this standard is met <em>“by weighing the demeanour of the complainant alongside both the internal and external consistencies found in the complainant’s testimony”</em> (per Chan J in <em>Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22000-SSP.xml')">[2018] 4 SLR 580</a> at [26] (“<em>Kunasekaran</em>”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore proceeded to evaluate the evidence of the Victim to determine if her evidence was unusually convincing.</a></p><a id="p1_37"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis of the Evidence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution’s case is that the accused had used criminal force on the Victim by touching her right nipple and squeezing her right breast.

Further, she candidly admitted that she had removed her bra on her own accord after she felt the accused fiddling with the bra strap.

This was because she was shocked, confused and didn’t know what to do. She even wondered whether what had just occurred was a special TCM way of massage, and began doubting herself as to what happened. This, in my view, was unsurprising.

Her evidence in Court as to what happened is consistent with her actions immediately after the incident, including the contemporaneous documentary evidence, namely, the text messages. The evidence of PW2, PW3 and PW5 not only supported her version of events that occurred that evening, but it also supported her evidence as to the distress that she had felt after the massage.</a></p><a id="p1_55"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a><a id="p1_56">56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it was PW4, and not the Victim who made the FIR, this was understandable, in light of her emotional condition immediately after the incident i.e. that she was shocked and confused Further, that FIR was made within two hours or so after the incident and this, in my view, gave more credence to her evidence as to what happened.</a></p><a id="p1_56"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the accused’s evidence has raised a reasonable doubt</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a><a id="p1_57">57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused’s defence is one of bare denial. While he did do the massage, he did not molest her. It is not his case that the touch was accidental. The accused did not call any other witnesses, although he had earlier indicated that he wished to call a few.</a></p><a id="p1_57"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a><a id="p1_58">58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not find his evidence satisfactory. First, I accepted he Prosecution’s submission that the accused’s evidence was evasive. He may, or may not have come to court with a prepared script but very often, in cross-examination, the accused failed to answer the Prosecution’s questions. He seemed to be answering the questions that he wanted to answer and not the questions that were asked. Some examples are:</a></p><a id="p1_58"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58"></a><a id="p1_58-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of the Victim when he entered the massage room, whether or not she was lying face down;<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took quite a while before the accused would answer the Prosecution’s question as to whether he had asked the Victim whether she was married or not, only to eventually answer “I cannot remember”.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a> However, subsequently, when the question was put to him that he had asked the Victim as to her marital status, he disagreed with that statement;</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59">59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused’s evidence was also at times, contradictory. For example:</a></p><a id="p1_59"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59"></a><a id="p1_59-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he was cross-examining the Victim, he put to the Victim that he had asked her to sit up when he entered the room, at the beginning of the massage.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a> However, in his own examination-in-chief, he testified that he had asked the Victim to lie down on the massage bed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> Eventually, he admitted that his account during the Victim’s cross-examination was not accurate;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise his account as to whether he massaged the Victim’s armpits. I note that during the Victim’s cross-examination,<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a> he asserted that he did not massage her armpits.

Having heard his version of what happened, and his answers to the Prosecution’s questions, I adjudged that it did not raise and reasonable doubt in my mind that he committed the act of molest against the Victim. In doing so, I bore in mind that the accused was not represented by counsel.</a></p><a id="p1_60"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision at the end of trial</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a><a id="p1_61">61&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, I found the Victim’s evidence to be unusually convincing. Her evidence was, in my view, internally and externally consistent. I had no doubt in my mind that the accused had used his hand and brushed the Victim’s nipples. In addition, he had used his hand to squeeze her breast. He did this without the Victim’s consent and the accused knew that his acts were likely to outrage the Victim’s modesty.</a></p><a id="p1_61"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a><a id="p1_62">62&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I did not find the accused’s denial convincing.

The following are my assessment of the five offence-specific aggravating factors cited:</a></p><a id="p1_75"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75"></a><a id="p1_75-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Degree of sexual exploitation</u>. I note that there was skin-to-skin contact with the Victim’s private parts. This, by itself, would be sufficient to place it in the upper end of Band 2 of the <em>Kunasekaran</em> sentencing framework.</a></p><a id="p1_75-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_a"></a><a id="">However, I agreed with the Prosecution that this was not as egregious as the acts of molest committed by the offender in <em>Ran Weidong.</em> In the present case, the touch was limited to the breast area, whereas the offender in <em>Ran Weidong</em> touched the victim’s vulva twice. Further, the accused’s touch in the present was not a <em>prolonged</em> or <em>sustained</em> touch when compared with that in <em>Ran Weidong</em>, although in the same breath, I would hesitate to describe it as being fleeting;</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_75-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Premeditation</u>. The Prosecution has used the fact that the Victim was ushered into a private room, when it was not really necessary as the basis for submitting that there was some form of premeditation. I disagreed. Like the offender in <em>Ran Weidong</em>, I assessed that the accused in the present case had simply been opportunistic. It has not been shown that he was responsible for the decision to massage the Victim in the private room. This assignment could have been done by the reception, or it could have been the practice of the TCM shop to use a massage room for longer massages. In my view, the accused took the opportunity to molest the Victim because he had been <em>assigned</em> to perform the massage in a private room;</a></p><a id="p1_75-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_75-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Abuse of trust</u>. Like the court in <em>Ran Weidong</em>, I accepted that there was some degree of an abuse of trust. The Victim had allowed herself to be massaged by the accused in the manner described implied that she trusted the accused as a professional masseur, and expected that he would perform the massage in a lawful manner. This was not unexpected because she had been satisfied with his service the previous week, Therefore, by outraging her modesty, the accused had thus abused this trust;</a></p><a id="p1_75-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_75-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Deception</u>. I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that there was deception. It was under the guise of performing the massage that he had molested her;</a></p><a id="p1_75-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_75-p2_e">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Harm caused</u>. Like the victim in <em>Ran Weidong</em>, there was no victim impact statement in the present case. However, the Victim, her mother, her sister and her boyfriend have given evidence as to how the incident had affected her.</a></p><a id="p1_75-p2_e"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75-p2_e"></a><a id="p1_76">76&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all, I found that there were at least four offence-specific aggravating factors. I was of the view that the aggravating factors cited above warranted a sentence slightly above the mid-range of Band 2 of the <em>Kunasekaran</em> sentencing framework.</a></p><a id="p1_76"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a><a id="p1_77">77&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Ran Weidong</em>, an imprisonment term of 14 months was imposed on the offence. As I had earlier mentioned, I found the facts of this case to be less egregious than that in <em>Ran Weidong</em>, accordingly, I adjudged that the appropriate sentence in this case was about 12 months’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_77"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Second Step: Offender-Specific Factors</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a><a id="p1_78">78&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I next reviewed the mitigating factors set out by the accused (see [70]), above. I did not think they warranted any downward adjustment of the sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_78"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether caning should be imposed</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a><a id="p1_79">79&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>PP v Chow Yee Sze</em> [2010] SGHC (“<em>Chow Yee Sze</em>”) at [9], the High Court held that caning will be imposed where a victim’s private parts and sexual organs were intruded upon. This itself was cited with approval in <em>GBR</em> at [21].</a></p><a id="p1_79"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a><a id="p1_80">80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, the act of molest committed by the accused involved skin-to-skin contact on the private parts of a victim, namely the breast. It comprised of two acts, the brushing of the accused’s palm over the Victim’s nipple and the squeezing of the breast, hence, I was of the view that caning would be appropriate. I adjudged that the appropriate number of strokes to be ordered was three.</a></p><a id="p1_80"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Final Sentence Imposed</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a><a id="p1_81">81&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the above reasons, I sentenced the accused to :</a></p><a id="p1_81"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81"></a><a id=""> <b>12 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane with effect from 9 November 2022 (date of sentence)</b> </a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_82">82&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused, being dissatisfied with his conviction and the sentence I have imposed, has now appealed against both conviction and sentence.
