She brought Joan to buffets and brought her onto a yacht. Joan’s scope of work was to massage the accused as well as general housework. She regarded Joan like her buddy and discussed a lot of things including financial matters.

The accused decided to sack her instantly, booked her ticket and told her to pack her things. She believed that Clayr was shocked and held a grudge against the accused because of this. She was shocked by Clayr’s testimony that she and Joan were sometimes not given enough food and when some food was given, they were leftovers and it looked like it was food for the pigs.

Joan assisted her to wear the socks again while the accused nagged at her. Joan then showed her a black face, walked straight to the back door, and banged the door. Jenefer was then sweeping leaves at the other side of the car porch.

The accused further testified that she barely used the sticks because of her trigger fingers and would only use it to point at things. She believed that Joan and Jenefer had made these allegations as she did not want to be sent back to the Philippines after seeing what had happened to Clayr and Emily.

On Sundays, he would wake up at 10:00am plus and bring his children out while the accused would be sleeping at that time. They would return home between 2:00 to 4:00pm as this was the usual time the accused would wake up.

He heard her saying to the maid “How come so long cannot wear the socks properly”. The accused then rushed him while complaining as she followed him to his car.

The trial commenced in December 2020 and lasted 22 days until 12 September 2022. Jenefer gave evidence over two tranches namely on 9 to 10 December 2020 and 10 February 2021 while Joan gave evidence over two tranches from 4 to 6 April 2022 and 12 September 2022. There was a lapse of more than four years for Joan and more than two years for Jenefer from the occurrence of the events in question to their testimonies in court.

It was also undisputed by the Defence that Jenefer was present in the vicinity at the material time.</a></p><a id="p1_104"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a><a id="p1_105">105&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, I found that the inconsistencies in Joan’s evidence in respect of the first amended charge as highlighted by the Defence in their written submissions were not material but were minor and insignificant. As set out above, it is common to have varying account of the same incident by the same person. No one can describe the same thing exactly in the same way repeatedly particularly when subjected to the rigours of a lengthy cross-examination. Given the lapse of time, in my view such discrepancies were not unexpected and did not affect Joan’s credibility. Hence, I agreed with the Prosecution that Joan’s overall evidence that she was kicked once in the chest had satisfied the key elements of the first amended charge beyond a reasonable doubt. I rejected the accused’s evidence that she did nothing further beyond nagging and scolding her.</a></p><a id="p1_105"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a><a id="p1_106">106&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the second amended charge, I found her testimony to be internally consistent with her statement recorded on 17 October 2018 at 3.52pm at [6] where she stated that there was another incident where the accused suddenly hit her head using her hand and she was wearing rings on that hand.</a></p><a id="p1_106"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a><a id="p1_107">107&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Joan’s account was externally consistent and corroborated by Jenefer who testified that she saw the accused knocking on Joan’s head once using her hand while wearing a ring.

During cross-examination, when asked what time the incident occurred, Joan testified that it was ‘very late in the afternoon almost night-time’. She then clarified that it was either around 12:00am to 1:00am or 2:00am to 3:00am. She initially testified that she felt “just a bit” of pain but during cross-examination, she agreed with the Defence that she felt no pain but had felt being hit. Unlike the incidents on 12 October 2018, Jenefer was not present, nor did Joan inform Dr Tai about this incident during her medical examination. According to Joan, Mr Sim was not in his room and only she and the accused were in his room at the material time.</a></p><a id="p1_110"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a><a id="p1_111">111&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution had relied on her statement recorded on 21 December 2018 at 5.10pm<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a> where she stated that the accused would get angry for not cleaning and used the stick to hit different parts of her body.

I found that both Joan and Jenefer’s statements were not corroborative as it related to unspecified instances of abuse involving different parts of Joan’s body. I was also troubled by the inconsistent timings provided by Joan to as when the incident took place. She had initially testified that it happened very late in the afternoon almost night-time. She then clarified that it was either around 12:00am to 1:00am or 2:00am to 3:00am.</a></p><a id="p1_112"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a><a id="p1_113">113&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, although Joan initially testified that she felt “just a bit” of pain, during cross-examination, she agreed with the Defence that she felt no pain but had felt being hit. As the Prosecution bears the onus of establishing all the elements beyond a reasonable doubt, I was of the view the element of hurt was not satisfied as Joan testified that she felt no pain. I agreed with the Defence that the amended third charge was not made out at all as the key element <em>ie</em> that hurt was caused had not been proven.</a></p><a id="p1_113"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a><a id="p1_114">114&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the facts, I found her evidence in respect of the amended third charge internally inconsistent and uncorroborated by extrinsic or objective evidence.

Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I found that the five incidents of pinching had occurred in September 2018. Further, as the five charges indicated the location of the offences as being at 24 Paradise Island, I found the discrepancies in the location within the house where the offences had occurred <em>ie</em> in the bedroom or living room to be minor and not significant.</a></p><a id="p1_115"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a><a id="p1_116">116&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the fourth amended charge, Jenefer had testified that the first occasion when the accused had pinched her was on her right bicep using her fingers while they were in the accused’s bedroom<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a>.

According to her, she never caused hurt to any of her maids and did not abuse any of them. It was undisputed that she had multiple domestic maids in her household in the past. On average between 2016 to 2018, she had an average of three domestic maids, with minimally two or maximum of four at any one time. Nevertheless, it was evident that she had sacked some of the domestic maids in the past even before they had completed their employment contract if she was dissatisfied with them.</a></p><a id="p1_141"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a><a id="p1_142">142&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During her testimony, she denied that her domestic maids did not have enough to eat as she would pack for them food from good restaurants and hotels. Whenever she was unable to sleep, she would take them for buffet breakfast at Grand Hyatt. She testified that she bought a lot of food for home and that the domestic maids were allowed to eat the food in the refrigerator. Nevertheless, as she did not like the smell of food going up to her air conditioning and her room, she would always advise them to steam or to boil the food.</a></p><a id="p1_142"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a><a id="p1_143">143&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her statement recorded on 17 October 2018 at 11:55pm, the accused stated that she treated both Joan and Jenefer like her children and she treated them like how she treated her family. She also stated that she had a good relationship with her helpers especially Joan as she had been working for her for years. After she was charged in court for the present offences, she provided Clementi Police Division with the contact details of some of her previous domestic maids to help the police investigate and to prove that her innocence.</a></p><a id="p1_143"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a><a id="p1_144">144&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She testified that she had a close, friendly, and playful relationship with Joan. She brought Joan to buffets and brought her onto a yacht. She regarded Joan like her buddy and discussed a lot of things including financial matters. As Joan had worked for her the longest, she left it to her to train the other domestic maids and allocate the different jobs amongst themselves. She was not close to Jenefer but she always spoke to Jenefer nicely and softly.</a></p><a id="p1_144"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a><a id="p1_145">145&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, Joan gave a different picture of her relationship with the accused. She testified that sometimes it was good and sometimes it was not as the accused would hit or beat her and used words like ‘Stupid’. She was unable to recall the number of times the accused had hit her but was able to recall four incidents. She further testified that the accused began hitting her in 2016 and on the four occasions, the accused had kicked her chest, beat her head with a ring on her finger, beat her head with a stick and beat her hips with a stick.</a></p><a id="p1_145"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a><a id="p1_146">146&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joan’s account of the history of physical abuse by the accused was externally consistent and corroborated by the evidence from the accused’s previous domestic helpers, Clayr and Mar Phyo who testified that she had been abusive towards Joan on many occasions. Clayr testified that during the time she worked for the accused, the accused had abused Joan on multiple occasions, including using a stick to hit Joan approximately a hundred times, and kicking Joan many times. Mar Phyo testified that she saw the accused hitting Joan on about four occasions – once with a cane, and about three times with the accused’s hand. In addition, their account was consistent with Rueles’ evidence that Joan told her that she was always hit by the accused.</a></p><a id="p1_146"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a><a id="p1_147">147&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noted that there was material internal inconsistency in the accused’s account of the events relating to the first amended charge. Although the accused claimed that she did not recall the incident involving the first amended charge in her statement recorded on 17 October 2018 at 11.55pm, in her cautioned statement recorded on 22 July 2020 at about 3.40pm, she stated that she “may had accidentally while talking to [Joan] switched [her] leg and touched [Joan]”. At trial, she testified that she had merely scolded Joan because Joan “can’t even wear socks after being so long here”.</a></p><a id="p1_147"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a><a id="p1_148">148&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Jenefer gave a different picture of her relationship with the accused. Jenefer testified that before the accused goes to sleep, she would have to massage her. Whenever the accused was unhappy with the way she was massaged, the accused would pinch her. According to Jenefer, the accused started pinching her sometime in September 2018. It is noteworthy that according to the accused, Jenefer would massage her for up to three hours to help her to sleep.</a></p><a id="p1_148"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a><a id="p1_149">149&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Joan and Clayr had testified that they did not have sufficient food to eat, and this included the leftovers that the accused had brought home for them. They were not allowed to cook their own food and were limited to eat instant noodles, eggs and canned food as the accused disliked the smell of their food. This was consistent with the accused’s own testimony that she did not like the smell of food going up to her air conditioning and her room. Their account was consistent with Rueles’ evidence that Joan told her that there was not enough food in the house.</a></p><a id="p1_149"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a><a id="p1_150">150&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, I did not the find the accused to be a credible or a truthful witness. After a careful examination, I found her evidence to be inherently incredible and materially inconsistent. Although the accused had portrayed herself as a benevolent employer who bought a lot of food, took her domestic maids for hotel buffets, or brought back food from good hotels and restaurants, she was silent on whether the unique work arrangements she imposed on her domestic maids ensured that they had sufficient rest or time to eat. They were expected to sleep when she slept in the day and attend to her needs whenever she was awake at home. Apart from the usual household chores, they also had to massage her for a significant period until she fell asleep. In her statement recorded on 17 October 2018 at 3:52pm at [3], Joan had stated that she was unable to sleep well due to the accused’s unique timings. In her statement recorded on 17 October 2018 at 5:20pm at [3], Jenefer had stated that as she was the one massaging the accused, she gets less rest than Joan.</a></p><a id="p1_150"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a><a id="p1_151">151&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I observed that the accused had an obvious tendency to twist and embellish her evidence to suit her own ends This is evident from the many allegations and claims she raised that were either not put to the relevant Prosecution witness or were inconsistent with her defence at trial. The accused claimed that exhibit P43 was not a photograph taken in the maid’s toilet because the toilet was “very bright”. This position was not put to Jenefer by the Defence. Jenefer was not asked to explain if she had even switched on the toilet light before taking the photograph.</a></p><a id="p1_151"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a><a id="p1_152">152&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was highlighted by the Prosecution that the accused had denied the eight amended charge because: (i) the lanterns Jenefer mentioned were for Children’s Day in October; (ii) the lanterns could not be hung without a ladder; (iii) the statue is “not breakable”; and (iv) she would not be concerned about the statue being knocked over because it was “already faded” and “meant to be thrown away”. I agreed with the Prosecution that these were afterthoughts on the accused’s part as they were not put to Jenefer during her cross-examination by the Defence.</a></p><a id="p1_152"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a><a id="p1_153">153&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused had suggested that Joan had made false allegations of abuse against her because Jenefer had told Joan that the next person to be sacked after Emily would be Joan. I agreed with the Prosecution that it was significant that Jenefer was not cross-examined on this which suggested that it was an afterthought. In addition, the accused claimed that she told Jenefer, sometime about October 2018, to learn as much as possible from Joan because she might sack Joan, allegedly in a bid to motivate Jenefer. Similarly, this was not put to Jenefer during her cross-examination.</a></p><a id="p1_153"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a><a id="p1_154">154&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During Jenefer’s cross-examination, it was the Defence’s case that the accused said to her that if her performance was sub-par, the accused would send her directly back to the Philippines instead of allowing a transfer. However, during her own testimony, the accused claimed that she “never threatened them or anything about sacking”.</a></p><a id="p1_154"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a><a id="p1_155">155&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused testified that the CCTV system was installed before they moved into 24 Paradise Island and she was the one who wanted them installed. According to her initially she was very enthusiastic about the house and told them to install many CCTV cameras. This was consistent with the King Island Pte Ltd invoice dated 30 October 2014<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a> for the installation of the CCTV system that was addressed to her. Although the accused testified that the purpose of the CCTV cameras in her house was to monitor the maids and admitted that the CCTV system could store the recorded footage, she later denied having the means to review the footage. I agreed with the Prosecution that it made little sense that the accused and Mr Sim would install a CCTV system if it did not allow them to review the footage during the day, especially when the accused had admitted in her statement recorded on 17 October 2018 that “[t]he reason for installing the CCTV is for safety reasons in case of theft cases”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156">156&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I noted from the tax invoice dated 30 October 2014, it was clear that the CCTV system installed at 24 Paradise Island was capable of recording as well as remote viewing. It was also inexplicable that after the police seized two CCTV servers from the accused’s home to ascertain if there were footages of the incidents of abuse, it was discovered that there were no hard disks in the two servers as shown in Exhibits P53 and P60. Furthermore, I observed that the outline or the stain marks from the hard disks could still be seen in Exhibits P54 and P61 with the necessary connecting cables remaining within the respective hard disk. This suggests that the hard disks had been removed from the two CCTV servers.</a></p><a id="p1_156"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Assessment of Mr Sim Guan Huat’s evidence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a><a id="p1_157">157&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, it was clear that Mr Sim was a partial witness whose evidence should be treated with caution. After assessing the totality of his evidence, I agreed with the Prosecution that he was not a credible witness. When questioned about his daily routine, he was very guarded in his evidence, even going to the extent of claiming that there were no deviations in his schedule from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018, and that he would be in his room after 11.00pm for every day of 2018. This defies belief, and he likely testified in such a manner to support the accused’s evidence in relation to her hitting Joan with a stick at the balcony of his room.</a></p><a id="p1_157"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a><a id="p1_158">158&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he agreed that nothing much happened on 12 October 2018, he was somehow able to recall details such as Jenefer being present when Joan was putting on the accused’s socks, and the accused complaining about Joan not being able to put on her socks properly. I agreed with the Prosecution that this was hard to believe unless something significant had happened on this day for the incident to be imprinted on his mind.</a></p><a id="p1_158"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a><a id="p1_159">159&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agreed with the Prosecution that it was concerning that Mr Sim’s evidence corroborated the accused’s evidence almost perfectly in almost every aspect of the case which he testified on. For example, he was quick to testify that the lanterns in exhibit P15 were “Children Day lantern” put up by Joan even though he later clarified that he was not present when the lanterns were hung up and had merely assumed that Joan put them up because the accused would usually instruct her to do the job.</a></p><a id="p1_159"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a><a id="p1_160">160&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also testified that whenever he went out with the accused to eat, she would order too much food and take a portion for the maids or the children the next day. He was also quick to testify that the accused would ask for takeaway boxes and pack the food even before they had started eating. This was clearly to corroborate the accused’s testimony that she provided a lot of food to their domestic helpers and that they were not given leftovers.</a></p><a id="p1_160"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a><a id="p1_161">161&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sim claimed that he gave up on the CCTV system in his house after asking 3 or 4 vendors about it and added that “[he] don’t know what they do, [he had] been paying them and it don’t last 6 months”. He also claimed that he had never seen the CCTV server, that he did not have the contact details of the CCTV contractors that he engaged, and that he installed the CCTV system just so that he could view live footage of his family. I agreed with the Prosecution that these claims were difficult to believe given that the CCTV system cost more than $23,000 just to install and set up and were likely made by Mr Sim such that he could claim ignorance in relation to why the hard disk drives for the CCTV server were missing.</a></p><a id="p1_161"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Impeachment proceedings</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a><a id="p1_162">162&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence had also sought to impeach the credit of four of Prosecution’s material witnesses namely Joan, Jenefer, Clayr and Mar Phyo on account of the material inconsistencies between their oral testimony and their previous statements.</a></p><a id="p1_162"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a><a id="p1_163">163&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As submitted by the Prosecution, in <em>Kwang Boon Keong Peter v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1998] 2 SLR(R) 0211.xml')">[1998] 2 SLR(R) 211</a>, the High Court explained at [18] that “the credit of a witness refers to his character and moral reliability whereas the credibility of a witness refers to his mental capacity and power to be a witness of veracity”. The High Court also explained the meaning and purpose of impeachment as follows at [19]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is a close relationship between the credit and credibility of a witness. The credit or discredit of a witness relates to his credibility. This brings us to the question of what it means by impeaching a person’s credit. The Oxford English Dictionary (2nd Ed) defines the word, “impeach”, as “to challenge, cast an imputation upon, attack”. To impeach a witness’ credit is to disparage or undermine his character and moral reliability and worth. The purpose of the impeachment of a witness’s credit is to undermine his credibility by showing that his testimony in court should not be believed because he is of such a character and moral make-up that he is one who is incapable of speaking the whole truth under oath and should not be relied on. …</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164">164&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the credit of a witness to be successfully impeached under s 157(c) of the Evidence Act 1893, the following requirements must be met (<em>Peter Kwang</em> at [21]-[26]):</a></p><a id="p1_164"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_164"></a><a id="p1_164-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witness’s former statement must be proved;</a></p><a id="p1_164-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_164-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_164-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be an actual inconsistency between the witness’s oral evidence and the statement which is not a minor difference or an apparent discrepancy;</a></p><a id="p1_164-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_164-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_164-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inconsistency must be so serious or material as to affect the credit of the witness;</a></p><a id="p1_164-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_164-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_164-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conflicting versions must be carefully explained to the witness, and he or she must have a fair and full opportunity to explain the difference; and</a></p><a id="p1_164-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_164-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_164-p2_e">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witness is unable to provide a convincing or credible explanation for the difference.</a></p><a id="p1_164-p2_e"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164-p2_e"></a><a id="p1_165">165&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Material inconsistencies are defined as inconsistencies that go to the crux of the charges against the accused person: see <em>Peter Kwang</em> at [26] and <em>Mohammed Zairi bin Mohamad Mohtar v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2002] 1 SLR(R) 0211.xml')">[2002] 1 SLR(R) 211</a> (“<em>Mohammed Zairi</em>”) at [34]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166">166&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As submitted by the Prosecution, the High Court cases of <em>Ang Lilian v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20890-SSP.xml')">[2017] 4 SLR 1072</a> (“<em>Ang Lilian</em>”) and <em>Tay Wee Kiat v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22301-SSP.xml')">[2018] 4 SLR 1315</a> (“<em>Tay Wee Kiat</em>”) provide useful guidance on what could amount to material inconsistencies in maid abuse cases:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_166-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the starting point is that adequate allowance must be accorded to human fallibility in retention, recollection, and description, especially when a significant period of time has lapsed, or the witness had been abused on many occasions (<em>Ang Lilian</em> at [29] and <em>Tay Wee Kiat</em> at [31], referencing <em>PP v Singh Kalpanath</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1995] 3 SLR(R) 0158.xml')">[1995] 3 SLR(R) 158</a> at [54] and [60]).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_166-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, inconsistencies as to dates and times are generally minor and immaterial (<em>Ang Lilian</em> at [29] and <em>Tay Wee Kiat</em> at [32]).</a></p><a id="p1_166-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_166-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_166-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, inconsistencies in the lead-up to the assault may not be material. In <em>Tay Wee Kiat</em>, Tay was charged with pulling the victim out of the car. Although the victim was inconsistent as to whether her luggage had been searched before the assault, the three-judge High Court found that this was not a material inconsistency and explained that the circumstances leading up to the abuse were “at best, peripheral matters which do not go to the heart of the charge” (at [35]).</a></p><a id="p1_166-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_166-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_166-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, inconsistencies on the details of the assault may not be material. Four examples from Tay Wee Kiat and Ang Lilian:</a></p><a id="p1_166-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_166-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_166-p2_d-p3_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tay was charged with directing the victim and another helper to slap each other ten times. In her statements to the police, the victim told the police that “the Prayer Incident” involved Tay using a cane to hit her but testified during her examination-in-chief that “the Prayer Incident” culminated in Tay directing her and the other helper to slap each other ten times. The High Court accepted the victim’s oral testimony despite the inconsistency as it was corroborated by the other helper. It considered that the victim’s candid disclosure of the inconsistency on the stand showed that she was a “generally honest witness who was concerned with telling the truth” (at [36]).</a></p><a id="p1_166-p2_d-p3_i"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_166-p2_d-p3_i"></a><a id="p1_166-p2_d-p3_ii">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tay was initially charged with slapping the victim, kicking her, pulling her hair, grabbing her chin, and pushing her against a wooden cabinet. However, during cross-examination, the victim said there was no slapping or kicking (<em>Tay Wee Kiat</em> at [37]). The Prosecution amended the charge to remove the reference to slapping and kicking. The High Court found that the victim’s inconsistency on this did not cast doubt on the conviction, because her evidence “fell squarely within the particulars of the amended charge” (at [38]).</a></p><a id="p1_166-p2_d-p3_ii"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_166-p2_d-p3_ii"></a><a id="p1_166-p2_d-p3_iii">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tay was also charged with hitting the victim with a cane. During her examination-in-chief, the victim testified that a bundle of three canes was used. However, under cross-examination, she said that a bamboo stick was used. The High Court found at [39] that this inconsistency was not material to the charge as it “did not affect her evidence that she was hit with a type of stick instrument, whether a bunch of three canes or a bamboo stick … [both of which] could fall within the wording of the charge”.</a></p><a id="p1_166-p2_d-p3_iii"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_166-p2_d-p3_iii"></a><a id="p1_166-p2_d-p3_iv">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ang was charged with dragging the victim to the toilet, spraying water at her eyes with a hose, and slapping her more than once. During her examination-in-chief, the victim testified that the spraying of water lasted “[a]bout 5 minutes, 10 minutes. 5 to 10 minutes”. Under cross-examination, the victim testified that the “whole incident” lasted “5-10 minutes”. The victim eventually conceded that she was not able to tell how long her face/eyes were sprayed with water. Despite this inconsistency, the High Court accepted at [35] that this detail was not material as “it did not detract from the fact that she has maintained throughout her testimony that her eyes [were] sprayed with water”.</a></p><a id="p1_166-p2_d-p3_iv"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_166-p2_d-p3_iv"></a><a id="p1_166-p2_e">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, inconsistencies as regards the sequence of events for the assault may not be material. In <em>Ang Lilian</em>, the victim’s evidence during her examination-in-chief was that she was hit once on her head with a three-pin-plug, pulled by her hair, pushed to the floor, and then slapped three times on her cheeks. During her cross-examination, she said she was pulled by her hair, pushed to the floor, hit on her head with the three-pin plug, and then slapped on her cheeks. The High Court found at [37] that this inconsistency in the sequence of events was minor “given that the nature of the individual acts and the attack as whole remained the same”.</a></p><a id="p1_166-p2_e"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166-p2_e"></a><a id="p1_167">167&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I was mindful that even if the witness’s credit is successfully impeached, this does not mean that all his or her oral testimony will have to be disregarded (<em>Public Prosecutor v BZT</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27453-SSP.xml')">[2022] SGHC 91</a> at [176]). The court will still have to scrutinize the whole of the evidence to determine what is true and which aspects should be disregarded (<em>Teo Geok Fong v Lim Eng Hock</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1996] 2 SLR(R) 0957.xml')">[1996] 2 SLR(R) 957</a> at [42]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168">168&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, I found that Joan’s credit was not impeached as she was largely consistent in her accounts about the key elements of the first amended charge and the second amended charge. Although I was not convinced that the element of hurt was satisfied in respect of the third amended charge, this did not mean that she lacked credibility or that her entire evidence of the physical abuse she suffered should be rejected in its entirety. This is because her evidence in respect of the two other charges were internally and externally consistent and was corroborated by extrinsic or objective evidence as set out above.</a></p><a id="p1_168"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a><a id="p1_169">169&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I considered that for Joan there was a long lapse of time of between three and a half to more than four years between the incidents of abuse in 2018 and her oral testimony on 4 to 6 April 2022 as well as 12 September 2022. Similarly, there was a long lapse in time between the dates on which her police statements were recorded <em>ie</em> 17 October 2018 and 21 December 2018 and her testimony. Furthermore, Joan was abused on multiple occasions from 2016 to 2018 such that she could only recollect four incidents. It would therefore be extremely difficult for her to remember the details of each incident with a high degree of accuracy.</a></p><a id="p1_169"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a><a id="p1_170">170&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I agreed with the Prosecution that testifying in court can be a very stressful experience even for witnesses who are able to understand English and follow court proceedings. Even more so for Joan, a foreigner who had to rely on the assistance of a Tagalog interpreter. Furthermore, the stress and pressure applied on her during cross-examination was immense as over the course of about two and a half days, Joan was repeatedly accused of lying and grilled on the details and different aspects of her evidence.</a></p><a id="p1_170"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a><a id="p1_171">171&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated at [99] above, I found Joan to be a truthful witness who gave a credible and candid account of the of the two incidents on 12 October 2018 save for the incident in 2018 at the balcony of Mr Sim’s bedroom. On a careful and holistic analysis of the facts, I found that Joan’s evidence in respect of the first two amended charges were not only internally and externally consistent on crucial points, but it was also corroborated by extrinsic evidence in the form of documentary evidence as well as independent witnesses. Hence, I found the various inconsistencies raised by the Defence in respect of the said charges involving Joan were minor and not significant and did not go to the crux of the charges. In any event, these discrepancies can be explained by the fallibility of human memory.</a></p><a id="p1_171"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a><a id="p1_172">172&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, I found that Jenefer’s credit was not impeached as she was largely consistent in her accounts about the key elements of the fourth amended charge to the eighth amended charges. As a whole, I found that none of the inconsistencies raised by the Defence as regards the five charges involving Jenefer were material inconsistencies. Jenefer’s evidence was consistent throughout that she was pinched by the accused, and for some of the charges the bruises or mark on her the respective parts of her body were caused by the accused’s pinching.</a></p><a id="p1_172"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a><a id="p1_173">173&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I considered that there was a lapse of time <em>ie</em> more than two years between the incidents of abuse and Jenefer’s oral testimony which was given over two tranches on 9 and 10 December 2020 and 10 February 2021. Similarly, there was also a lapse in time between the dates on which her police statements were recorded namely, 17 October 2018 and 21 December 2018 and her testimony. Furthermore, Jenefer was abused on multiple occasions. It would therefore be extremely difficult for her to remember the details of each incident with a high degree of accuracy.</a></p><a id="p1_173"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a><a id="p1_174">174&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I agreed with the Prosecution that testifying in court can be a very stressful experience even for witnesses who are able to understand English and follow court proceedings. Even more so for Jenefer, a foreigner who had to rely on the assistance of a Tagalog interpreter. Furthermore, the stress and pressure applied on Jenefer during cross-examination was immense as over the course of about two and a half days, Jenefer was repeatedly accused of lying and grilled on the details and different aspects of her evidence. I considered the fact that Jenefer broke down more than once during the process of cross-examination and was also in visible distress at certain points during cross-examination.</a></p><a id="p1_174"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a><a id="p1_175">175&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated at [114] above, I found Jenefer to be a truthful witness who gave a credible and candid account of the various pinching incidents as set out in the five amended charges. On a careful and holistic analysis of the facts, I found that Jenefer’s evidence was not only internally and externally consistent on crucial points, but it was also corroborated by extrinsic evidence in the form of documentary evidence as well as independent witnesses. Hence, I found the various inconsistencies raised by the Defence in respect of the five charges involving Jenefer were minor and not significant and did not go to the crux of the charges. In any event, these discrepancies can be explained by the fallibility of human memory.</a></p><a id="p1_175"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a><a id="p1_176">176&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also the Defence’s position that Clayr was not a reliable witness, and her credit should be impeached. It was submitted that Joan had repeatedly testified that she was only kicked once by the accused. However, Clayr claimed to have witnessed the accused assault Joan far more frequently. Clayr testified that between March 2017 and around 9 August 2018, she had seen the accused kick Joan 50 or more times and seen the accused use a stick to hit Joan almost every day during the about 18 months that she worked for the accused’s family.</a></p><a id="p1_176"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a><a id="p1_177">177&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, Clayr’s evidence must be taken in its proper context considering Joan’s own testimony. Joan testified that the accused began hitting her in 2016 even before Clayr started working for the accused. Joan herself was unable to recall the number of times the accused had hit her but was only able to recall four incidents. According to Joan, on these four occasions the accused had kicked her chest, beat her head with a ring on her finger, beat her head with a stick and beat her hips with a stick. In any event, the relevant period of abuse for Joan for my consideration was in October 2018 for the first two amended charges and in 2018 for the third amended charge.</a></p><a id="p1_177"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a><a id="p1_178">178&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agreed with the Prosecution that while there were some inconsistencies between the evidence of Clayr and Joan, most of these inconsistencies could be explained by human fallibility in retention, recollection, and description. Furthermore, there were very long lapses of time between the abuse that Clayr witnessed March 2017 to August 2018 and her testimony on 8 March 2021 and 28 and 29 July 2021. Clayr too was subjected to rigorous and detailed cross-examination on the details and different aspects of her evidence as well as her statement.</a></p><a id="p1_178"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a><a id="p1_179">179&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was clear from Clayr’s evidence that the accused had abused Joan on many occasions over a prolonged period. This would make it harder not only for Clayr to accurately remember what happened, but also harder for Joan to remember the details of how she was abused. Seen in their proper context, I agreed with the Prosecution none of the inconsistencies raised by the Defence would warrant the impeachment of the credit of Clayr. Based on these factors, I found that Clayr’s credit was not impeached.</a></p><a id="p1_179"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a><a id="p1_180">180&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, it was the Defence’s position that Mar Phyo was not a reliable witness, and her credit should be impeached. It was submitted that she claimed that she had seen four instances of the accused assaulting Joan. The first incident involved the accused using a 30 to 40cm long cane to hit Joan on the calf below the knee, whilst they were at the ground floor of the house. On the other three instances, the accused had used a hand to hit Joan at the back of her shoulder, but she could not give any other details about these incidents, such as the date, location, or circumstances under which they occurred.</a></p><a id="p1_180"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a><a id="p1_181">181&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was further submitted that Mar Phyo worked for the accused’s family for only 9 months and wanted to leave for her own personal reason of dissatisfaction with the work she was tasked to do and the odd working hours. Given the briefness of her stay and the fact that she left Singapore sometime in 2016, it was clear that none of the alleged four incidents relate to the first to third amended charges, which are said to have occurred in 2018.</a></p><a id="p1_181"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a><a id="p1_182">182&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, I was of the view that Mar Phyo’s evidence must be taken in its proper context considering Joan’s own testimony. Mar Phyo had worked for the accused family between 2015 and 2016 and Joan testified that the accused began hitting her in 2016. Joan herself was unable to recall the number of times the accused had hit her but was only able to recall four incidents as stated earlier. While none of the incidents that Mar Phyo had witnessed relate to the three amended charges involving Joan, it was clear from the evidence of that the accused had abused Joan on many occasions over a prolonged period. This would make it harder for not only Mar Phyo to accurately remember what happened, but also harder for Joan to remember the details of how she was abused. Seen in their proper context, I agreed with the Prosecution none of the inconsistencies raised by the Defence would warrant the impeachment of the credit of Mar Phyo. Based on these factors, I found that Mar Phyo’s credit was not impeached.</a></p><a id="p1_182"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a><a id="p1_183">183&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things considered, at the conclusion of the 22-day-trial, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case in respect of seven out of the eight charges beyond a reasonable doubt and convicted the accused on these charges.

Joan and Jenefer had not provided any credible explanation for the duration of unemployment based on the MOM records which the Defence did not dispute. Both victims in their police statements they had indicated that they did not wish to pursue the criminal case and had just wanted to change employers. If that was their stated position and when they were cross-examined on their statements, they had not derogated from that or in any part of their testimony during the trial, it was the Defence’s position that it would not be fair to ask the accused to compensate them for their loss of income. In respect of their normal income claims up to the date they stopped working in the accused’s household, all such payment claims have already been long sorted out with the assistance of MOM after police investigations begun.</a></p><a id="p1_218"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentencing principles for domestic maid abuse</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_218"></a><a id="p1_219">219&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my consideration of the appropriate sentence to be imposed, I was conscious that the principles of deterrence and retribution take centre stage in domestic maid abuse cases. This was articulated by the Court of Appeal in <em>ADF v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 1 SLR 0874.xml')">[2010] 1 SLR 874</a> which observed as [55]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">In a case of domestic maid abuse, ordinarily, the principles of deterrence and retribution take precedence. A deterrent sentence signifies that there is a public interest to protect over and above the ordinary punishment of criminal behaviour. The protection of domestic maids from abuse by their employers is always a matter of public interest, given their vulnerable status and the prevalence of such relationships in Singapore. No employer or household member has the right to engage in abusive behaviour against a domestic maid. All maids should be treated fairly, with dignity and respect. Indeed, domestic maid abuse not only causes harm to the victim and calls for deep public indignation; it could also harm Singapore’s bilateral relations with other countries.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_220">220&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, custodial sentences are invariably the starting point for domestic maid abuse cases. Further, the Court of Appeal held in <em>ADF</em> at [91]:</a></p><a id="p1_220"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">An employer’s unhappiness with a domestic maid’s work or conduct should never justify any form of abuse. All such offences are, in the eyes of the law, unprovoked.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_220"></a><a id="p1_221">221&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, a custodial sentence is almost invariably warranted in cases of domestic maid abuse where there has been any manner of physical abuse. In the present case, I did not find any extenuating or exceptional circumstances warranting a departure from this position and I disagreed with the Defence’s submissions for the imposition of fines in respect of all seven charges. It was also clear from the written plea in mitigation that the accused was unremorseful for her actions and had sought to downplay the seriousness of the abuse suffered by Joan and Jenefer by submitting that they were isolated events during a short window period, there was no evidence of systematic abuse and that the victims only suffered transient and/or minimal pain.</a></p><a id="p1_221"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_221"></a><a id="p1_222">222&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not place much weight on the 30 character references submitted by the Defence, particularly those which urged the court to reconsider its verdict or those who have indicated their disbelief that the accused had been abusive to the two victims in view of my decision to convict her on 9 December 2022. Furthermore, it is well established that little weight should be given to an accused’s previous good behaviour where serious offences particularly those where the principles of deterrence and retribution takes precedence are committed.</a></p><a id="p1_222"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_222"></a><a id="p1_223">223&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my determination of the appropriate sentence to be imposed in respect of each charge, I am further guided by the sentencing framework for cases of domestic maid abuse established by the 3-judge High Court panel in <em>Tay Wee Kiat v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22301-SSP.xml')">[2018] 4 SLR 1315</a> at [70] to [75] which is as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_223-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Step 1</u>: Determine whether the harm caused to the victim is predominantly physical or both physical and psychological.</a></p><a id="p1_223-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_223-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_223-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Step 2</u>: If the harm is both physical and psychological, the court should identify the degree of harm caused in relation to the charge under s 323 r/w s 73(2) Penal Code with regard to the following indicative ranges:</a></p><a id="p1_223-p2_b"> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="32.62%"><col width="32.68%"><col width="34.7%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class="br" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p> </td><td class="br" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Less serious physical harm</b> </p> </td><td class="b" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>More serious physical harm</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td class="br" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Less serious psychological harm</b> </p> </td><td class="br" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3–6 months’ imprisonment</p> </td><td class="b" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">6–18 months’ imprisonment</p> </td></tr><tr><td class="r" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>More serious psychological harm</b> </p> </td><td class="r" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">6–18 months’ imprisonment</p> </td><td class="" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">20–30 months’ imprisonment</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear="left"><br clear="left"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_223-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_223-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Step 3</u>: To adjust the sentence to be imposed having regard to the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.</a></p><a id="p1_223-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_223-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_224">224&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would have to determine which sentences should run consecutively and which concurrently.</a></p><a id="p1_224"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_224"></a><a id="p1_225">225&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Step 1, I had to determine whether the harm caused to the victim was predominantly physical, or both physical and psychological. If the offence does not form part of any broader trend or history of abusive conduct, and does not involve particularly degrading or humiliating treatment, the harm would probably be predominantly physical (in addition to the distress that the victim would invariably feel from being physically assaulted). In that case, the court should consider the degree of harm as well as other aggravating and mitigating factors in determining the appropriate sentence, bearing in mind other maid abuse precedents, and that “a custodial sentence is almost invariably warranted in cases of domestic maid abuse where there has been any manner of physical abuse”. Where the harm is both physical and psychological, the second step is for the court to identify the degree of harm caused in relation to each charge.</a></p><a id="p1_225"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_225"></a><a id="p1_226">226&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, I agreed with the Prosecution that the harm caused to both Joan and Jenefer were both physical and psychological. In respect of Joan, I found that there was psychological harm in view of the sustained pattern of abuse namely, the multiple incidents of the accused causing hurt to her. Joan testified that the accused had beat and hit her many times from 2016 until October 2018 and the abuse had affected her emotionally. This was also corroborated by both Clayr and Mar Phyo.</a></p><a id="p1_226"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_226"></a><a id="p1_227">227&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I disagreed with the Defence’s submissions that the difficult working conditions do not equate to psychological harm and are more appropriately dealt with by MOM as they deal with separate interests from those protected by s 323 of the Penal Code. In my view, I was entitled to consider whether there was a sustained pattern of abuse in determining whether there was psychological harm caused to both domestic maids in the present case based on the totality of the evidence before me.</a></p><a id="p1_227"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_227"></a><a id="p1_228">228&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I further disagreed with the Defence that I should not accept Joan’s evidence that she hit with a stick many times before the incident in respect of the third amended charge which involved Joan being hit her on her torso with a stick as I had acquitted the accused. As explained earlier, I had found that Joan had not given a clear and consistent account of the facts relating to the third amended charge and it was not corroborated by any extrinsic or objective evidence. This did not mean that Joan’s evidence should be rejected in its entirety on the grounds that she was not a credible witness. In the present case, I had accepted Joan’s evidence in relation to the other two amended charges that she was kicked on her chest and hit on her head by the accused with her hand with a ring on her finger by the accused as I found her evidence to be credible and internally consistent. Furthermore, it was also externally consistent with the extrinsic evidence from the various Prosecution witnesses.</a></p><a id="p1_228"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_228"></a><a id="p1_229">229&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I agreed with the Prosecution that her working conditions was oppressive and exploitative based on Joan’s evidence of her long working hours, the insufficient amount of food provided as well as the salary deductions on a regular basis whenever the accused was not satisfied with her work performance. For instance, sometimes she had to stay awake the whole night to complete the household chores or massage the accused. She would usually eat two meals a day and sometimes did not have enough food.</a></p><a id="p1_229"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_229"></a><a id="p1_230">230&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, I agreed with the Prosecution that Jenefer’s working conditions was also oppressive and exploitative. She would sleep at 1:00 or 2:00 pm and wake up at about 5:00 to 6:00 pm. At times, she did not have sufficient time to eat and sleep. Although Jenefer had worked for the accused for about three months, she was physically abused on at least five occasions as set out in the charges. She was verbally abused by the accused as she was scolded by the accused almost every day. She was afraid of reporting the abuse to MOM, the police, and the authorities as she feared being sent back to the Philippines and blacklisted. Both Joan and Jenefer had also suffered physical harm as a result of the accused’s actions towards them as both had felt bodily pain when the accused caused hurt to them.</a></p><a id="p1_230"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_230"></a><a id="p1_231">231&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Step 2, I had to identify the degree of harm caused in relation to each charge. In respect of MCN 901317-2020 and MCN 901318-2020 involving Joan, I agreed with the Prosecution that the degree of psychological harm was significant as she was abused on a regular basis for about two years against a backdrop of miserable working conditions. The physical harm which involved a kick on Joan’s chest and hitting her on her head was not serious as she had not sustained any visible injuries. Hence, the relevant sentencing range would be six to 18 months’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_231"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_231"></a><a id="p1_232">232&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the remaining five charges, namely MCN 901318-2020 to MCN 901322- 2020 involving Jenefer, I agreed with the Prosecution that the degree of psychological harm was not very serious as she had only worked for the accused for about three months against the backdrop of regular verbal abuse and miserable working conditions. The physical harm which involved the accused pinching her arms, her thigh and her chest were not serious in view of the nature of injuries she suffered which manifested in bruises in some instances. Hence, the relevant sentencing range would be three to six months’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_232"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_232"></a><a id="p1_233">233&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Step 3, I had to adjust the sentence of each charge to take into account other aggravating or mitigating factors. In the present, there were no significant aggravating factors, and no mitigating factor applies as the accused had claimed trial to all eight charges. After carefully considering the facts of the case as well as the submissions by both the Prosecution and the Defence, I imposed the following sentences:</a></p><a id="p1_233"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_233"></a><a id="p1_233-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCN 901317-2020 – six months’ imprisonment;</a></p><a id="p1_233-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_233-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_233-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCN 901318-2020 – six months’ imprisonment;</a></p><a id="p1_233-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_233-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_233-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCN 901320-2020 – four months’ imprisonment;</a></p><a id="p1_233-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_233-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_233-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCN 901321-2020 – three months’ imprisonment;</a></p><a id="p1_233-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_233-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_233-p2_e">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCN 901322-2020 – four months’ imprisonment;</a></p><a id="p1_233-p2_e"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_233-p2_e"></a><a id="p1_233-p2_f">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCN 901323-2020 – four months’ imprisonment;</a></p><a id="p1_233-p2_f"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_233-p2_f"></a><a id="p1_233-p2_g">(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCN 901324-2020 – three months’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_233-p2_g"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_233-p2_g"></a><a id="p1_234">234&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having determined the individual sentences for each charge, the next step is for the court to decide which sentences to run consecutively and which concurrently, in accordance with the principles set out in <em>Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16232-SSP-M.xml')">[2014] 2 SLR 998</a>.

She was unemployed for about 2.5 months before she was reemployed. Based on her monthly salary of $600, I agreed with the Prosecution that a sum $1,500 was appropriate for her loss of come.

I was of the view that the period of loss of income should be capped at 4 months as I was guided by the High Court’s assessment in <em>Tay Wee Kiat</em> that a period of four months is a reasonable estimation of the time a victim would reasonably require to take on alternative employment. Based on her monthly salary of $650, her loss of income amounted to $2,600. Hence, I ordered $5,100 as the total amount of compensation payable by the accused to Jenefer.</a></p><a id="p1_239"> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"></a><p class="Footnote"><a id="p1_239"><sup></sup></a><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a>Exhibits D36 and D37.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>Exhibits P43 to P46.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>Exhibit P48.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>Exhibit P1.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_5_1" id="Ftn_5">[note: 5]</a></sup>Exhibits P5 to P39.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_6_1" id="Ftn_6">[note: 6]</a></sup>Exhibit P2.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_7_1" id="Ftn_7">[note: 7]</a></sup>Exhibit P3.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_8_1" id="Ftn_8">[note: 8]</a></sup>Exhibit P4.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_9_1" id="Ftn_9">[note: 9]</a></sup>Exhibits P5 to P39.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_10_1" id="Ftn_10">[note: 10]</a></sup>Exhibit P49 to P62.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_11_1" id="Ftn_11">[note: 11]</a></sup>Exhibit D36.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_12_1" id="Ftn_12">[note: 12]</a></sup>Exhibit D9.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_13_1" id="Ftn_13">[note: 13]</a></sup>Exhibit D37 at [2] of Question 1.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_14_1" id="Ftn_14">[note: 14]</a></sup>Exhibit D14 at [5] of Question 2.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_15_1" id="Ftn_15">[note: 15]</a></sup>Exhibit P13.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_16_1" id="Ftn_16">[note: 16]</a></sup>Exhibits P45 and P46.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_17_1" id="Ftn_17">[note: 17]</a></sup>Exhibit D13.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_18_1" id="Ftn_18">[note: 18]</a></sup>Exhibit P43.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_19_1" id="Ftn_19">[note: 19]</a></sup>Exhibit P15.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_20_1" id="Ftn_20">[note: 20]</a></sup>Exhibit 40 at page 2.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_21_1" id="Ftn_21">[note: 21]</a></sup>Exhibit 40 at page 2.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_22_1" id="Ftn_22">[note: 22]</a></sup>Exhibit P42.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_23_1" id="Ftn_23">[note: 23]</a></sup>Exhibits P35 to P38.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_24_1" id="Ftn_24">[note: 24]</a></sup>Exhibits D20.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_25_1" id="Ftn_25">[note: 25]</a></sup>Exhibit D1.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_26_1" id="Ftn_26">[note: 26]</a></sup>Exhibits D1 to D28.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_27_1" id="Ftn_27">[note: 27]</a></sup>Exhibit D9.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_28_1" id="Ftn_28">[note: 28]</a></sup>Exhibit D1 at Question 10.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_29_1" id="Ftn_29">[note: 29]</a></sup>Exhibit D21.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_30_1" id="Ftn_30">[note: 30]</a></sup>Exhibits D3 to D8.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_31_1" id="Ftn_31">[note: 31]</a></sup>Exhibit D36.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_32_1" id="Ftn_32">[note: 32]</a></sup>Exhibit D37 at [2] of Question 1.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_33_1" id="Ftn_33">[note: 33]</a></sup>Exhibit D14 at [5] of Question 2.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_34_1" id="Ftn_34">[note: 34]</a></sup>Exhibit P13.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_35_1" id="Ftn_35">[note: 35]</a></sup>Exhibits P45 and P46.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_36_1" id="Ftn_36">[note: 36]</a></sup>Exhibit P42.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_37_1" id="Ftn_37">[note: 37]</a></sup>Exhibit D13.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_38_1" id="Ftn_38">[note: 38]</a></sup>Exhibit P43.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_39_1" id="Ftn_39">[note: 39]</a></sup>Exhibit P43.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_40_1" id="Ftn_40">[note: 40]</a></sup>Exhibit P44.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_41_1" id="Ftn_41">[note: 41]</a></sup>Exhibit P42.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_42_1" id="Ftn_42">[note: 42]</a></sup>Exhibit D13.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_43_1" id="Ftn_43">[note: 43]</a></sup>Exhibit D13.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_44_1" id="Ftn_44">[note: 44]</a></sup>Exhibit P64.</p></div></content></html>
