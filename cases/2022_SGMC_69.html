She was charged with three counts of employing a foreign employee without a valid work permit in contravention of section 5(1) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Chapter 91A, 2009 Rev Ed) (“<b>EFMA</b>”). Each of the three charges attract enhanced punishment under section 5(6)(b)(i) of the EFMA because of her previous conviction under section 5(1) of the same Act.</a></p><a id="p1_1"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 30 November 2022, I delivered judgment on the present case where I read out my brief oral remarks to explain why I was not calling for the accused to enter her defence on the three charges. I also stated that my brief oral remarks were delivered subject to full grounds being issued in due course, if necessary. The Prosecution has since applied for my written grounds of decision. Pursuant to section 298 of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (“CPC”), I am issuing my written grounds of decision to facilitate parties on their next course of action.</a></p><a id="p1_2"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Charges</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three charges proceeded with by the Prosecution were largely similar in that they alleged that on <em><u>at least</u></em> one occasion during various periods of time, the accused did employ a particular foreigner, “…as a food preparation assistant for [her] business FVP Trading and Services…without a valid work pass…”, in contravention of section 5(1) of the EFMA. With the exception of the second foreigner (B2), each of the other two foreigners, were in fact, <u>also employed with a valid work permit</u> to work as a foreign domestic worker (“<b>FDW</b>”) <u>for the same period of time</u>. For B2, the period set out in the charge (i.e. her alleged employment as a “food preparation assistant”) largely overlapped with her employment period as a FDW.</a></p><a id="p1_3"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For easy reference, I have reproduced the text of the first charge, and also set out the differentiating details of the other charges in a table below.

a valid work pass, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Chapter 91A, 2009 Rev Ed) (“EFMA”).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">And further,</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">That you, prior to the commission of the said offence, were on 17 April 2012 in Court 23 of the State Courts convicted on two charges under section 5(1) of the EFMA (vide MAC-001621-2012 and MAC-001622-2012) and sentenced to $1,800 fine per charge, which convictions and sentences have not been set aside to-date, and you are therefore liable to be punished

At [33], his Honour stated:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">As explained by Chan Sek Keong CJ in <em>Re Nalpon Zero Geraldo Mario</em> [20121 3 SLR 440 ("<em>Re Nalpon</em>") at [261, this is a statutory codification of the test which was set out in the seminal decision of the Privy Council in <em>Haw Tua Tau v PP</em> [1981-19821 SLR@ 133 ("<em>Haw Tua Tau</em>"). The question, Chan CJ explained, was not whether the evidence as it presently stood had already established the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt but whether the evidence — if it were all accepted as accurate — would do so (at [261). <u>At a minimum the evidence put forward has to cover every constituent element of the offence in question; if it did not, then it would plainly be impossible for a conviction to be lawfully sustained</u>. In deciding whether to call on the accused to enter his defence, regard should be had to the following guiding propositions:</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All evidence of primary fact should be accepted as being true, unless it is so inherently incredible that no reasonable person would be able to accept it as being true or if it has been discredited or shown to be wholly unreliable. This may happen, for example, during the course of cross-examination (see <em>Haw Tua Tau</em> at [151; <em>Re Nalpon</em> at [251).</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inferences may be drawn, but only if they are reasonable — it is not enough that the inference may be credible or not inherently incredible. In this regard, there is a different standard which applies to primary facts and inferences insofar as the former should be accepted as true unless it is inherently incredible whereas inferences can only be accepted if they can reasonably be drawn (see <em>Re Nalpon</em> at [251). It is not necessary that the inference be irresistible or that it must be only possible inference that may be drawn from the facts.</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The totality of the evidence has to be considered when determining whether evidence is so inherently incredible that it can be accepted or if the inferences sought to be drawn are reasonable enough to pass muster<b><em>.

Such work included peeling the bananas, wrapping the peeled bananas with spring roll skins, cutting vegetables and grating sweet potatoes, wrapping the vegetables and sweet potatoes with the spring roll skin, and placing food into plastic containers for the accused’s business.

Such assistance cannot be construed as "usage" within the meaning of the word "employ" as defined under s 2 EFMA.</a></p><a id="p1_26"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, the charges state that on at least one occasion, the Foreigners spent between one and a half to 3 hours assisting the accused in food preparation. There was no other evidence suggesting any further involvement.

Further, BI-B3 had adequate rest, sleep and food, as well as lodging and their salaries were paid on time. They also had 4 off-days a month on Sundays.

It was also undisputed that <b><em>each of the Foreigners had a valid work permit to perform their role as FDWs</em></b> at the material time. In addition, it was not disputed that the accused has a previous conviction for employing a foreigner without a valid work permit, albeit that the facts of that case were highly dissimilar to those of the current case (see Annex E and F). In any event, the Prosecution, correctly in my view, made no suggestion that the accused’s previous conviction, in any way, meant that she was culpable in the present case, or that her antecedent was somehow indicative of her guilt on the present charges.</a></p><a id="p1_35"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main remaining issue was whether the Prosecution had adduced sufficient evidence to establish the essential element of each charge, namely that the accused did employ each of the Foreigners (B1, B2 and B3) as a “food preparation assistant” over essentially the same period that they were working as FDWs for the accused under a separate and valid work permit.</a></p><a id="p1_36"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Meaning of “employ” under the EFMA</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Relative dearth of cases on meaning of “employ” under the EFMA </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I start off my analysis by considering the definition of “employ” as set out in s 2 of the EFMA.

Thus, parties did not have to address either of the District Courts, nor did the judges in those cases have the opportunity, or the need, to consider arguments on this matter.

However, it was not shown that what the three Foreigners did, could be said to be doing “work” within the meaning of the EFMA.

This would be aligned with the words of the ASOF at [6] where it was provided that “(t)heir assistance was voluntary, and they only assisted when they are free and able to.”</a></p><a id="p1_68-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_68-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the intent and output of the Foreigners was not “work” within the meaning set out in the EFMA, certainly not from what was described in the ASOF.</a></p><a id="p1_68-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_69">69&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, one can look at the interaction between the accused and the Foreigners, as regards the role of the Foreigners as FDWs. In that context, in the performance of their work being employed as FDWs (for which they each had a work permit), it was specifically provided at [4] of the ASOF that the accused would give “<b><u>work instructions</u></b>” to the Foreigners to perform work duties such as caring for the children and the dog, and also performing household chores. <u>In contrast, there was nothing stated in the ASOF that the accused gave “work instructions” to the Foreigners in their alleged role as “food preparation assistants</u>”. Instead, as stated earlier, the words used in the ASOF were that what the Foreigners did was (only) to “help” or “assist” the accused, on a voluntary and ad hoc basis.</a></p><a id="p1_69"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a><a id="p1_70">70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, it was highly doubtful that what the Foreigners did, by cutting vegetables etc., even amounted to work, within the meaning of s 2 of the EFMA.</a></p><a id="p1_70"> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No evidence any of the Foreigners was in the role of “food preparation assistant”, or that this role required an additional work permit</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a><a id="p1_71">71&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separately, even if the Foreigners could be said to be providing their services for the purpose of “work” within the meaning of s 2 of the EFMA, it was not shown that this made them “food preparation assistants” as alleged in the charge, or that a separate work permit (beyond the work permit already granted to B1-B3 as FDWs) was required for each of them to assume this role.</a></p><a id="p1_71"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a><a id="p1_72">72&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, it would appear from the clarification made by the Prosecution at [3] of its supplementary submissions dated 5 October 2022, that the “…said term “food preparation assistants”, is not a term ordinary used to describe the work that the three FDWs in the present case were engaged in”.</a></p><a id="p1_72"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a><a id="p1_73">73&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my respectful view, the Prosecution’s belated clarification above cast further doubt on whether the accused could have even applied for a work permit for the Foreigners to be “food preparation assistants”, when this phrase did not even properly describe what the Foreigners did at the accused’s home by cutting vegetables etc. But this was precisely what the Prosecution alleged that she should have done i.e. applied for such a work permit for each of the three Foreigners. It was the Prosecution’s case that because of her failure to do this, that she had committed the alleged offences.</a></p><a id="p1_73"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a><a id="p1_74">74&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect, if the accused could not even have applied for a work permit to employ any of the Foreigner as a “food preparation assistant”, she could not hardly be said to have committed an offence for her “failure” to do so.</a></p><a id="p1_74"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a><a id="p1_75">75&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For completeness, I would add that in the present case, there was also no evidence led as to what was the proper or correct type of work permit the accused should have applied for, even if it could be said that she had “employed” the Foreigners, when she asked them to cut vegetables etc, <u>OR</u> that a separate work permit was even needed for such “employment”. These appear to be issues that were never considered or addressed by the Prosecution.</a></p><a id="p1_75"> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lack of evidence of the duration of alleged employment</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a><a id="p1_76">76&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I deal with one last issue pertaining to the element of employment.

These periods essentially covered the entire time the Foreigners were also employed by her as FDWs (with a slight variation in the case of B2), for which the accused had already applied for the requisite work permit for them to be FDWs</a></p><a id="p1_77"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a><a id="p1_78">78&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even taking the Prosecution’s case at its highest, the only evidence adduced in the ASOF, was that on “at least one occasion”, B1-B3 rendered assistance in food preparation, and the duration involved was for 1.5 hours in the case of B2, and 2-3 hours in the case of B1 and B3 (Table 2 at [5] of the ASOF). There was <b><u>no evidence</u></b> that the accused engaged the services of B1-B3 <b><u>for the entire period</u></b> of 1 to 3 months as alleged in the respective charges.</a></p><a id="p1_78"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a><a id="p1_79">79&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I agreed with the Prosecution that there was no need to show that the Foreigners were actually cutting vegetables etc. for the entire period of their alleged employment as “food preparation assistants”, or that the Foreigners were carrying out such tasks on a 24/7 basis, there should at least be some evidence led that the Foreigners were obliged to, or could be called upon by the accused, their alleged employer, to perform the role of “food preparation assistants” during the period set out in the charges. Even then, with respect, the Prosecution failed to adduce any evidence to support this position.</a></p><a id="p1_79"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_79"></a><a id="p1_79-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one, since it was not even clear when the accused sought the assistance of B1-B3 to help her with the food preparation work, and specifically whether she had asked for their help before or at the start of their employment as FDWs, there was no basis for the Prosecution to allege that the accused employed them as “food preparation assistants” <b><em><u>from the start </u></em></b><u>of their employment as FDWs</u>, even if I accepted that she had even employed them as “food preparation assistants” at all.</a></p><a id="p1_79-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_79-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_79-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither was there evidence that these Foreigners would be obliged to, or could be directed/instructed by the accused to carry out these tasks (as “food preparation assistants”) for any part of the rest of the period set out in the respective charges. Instead, they would apparently only help <em><u>as and when they could</u></em>, since the facts made it clear that they only “voluntary offer to help the accused”, and they “only assisted when they are free and able to do so” (see [5] and [6] of the ASOF).</a></p><a id="p1_79-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_80">80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarise, for the purpose of deciding whether to call the accused to give her defence, I was not satisfied that there was some evidence adduced by the Prosecution that satisfied the element that the accused had employed B1-B3 as “food preparation assistants” without a valid work permit, in the manner alleged in the respective charges.</a></p><a id="p1_80"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Additional failure to adduce evidence of the requisite mens rea </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a><a id="p1_81">81&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence also argued that the accused lacked the necessary <em>mens rea</em> to employ the said FDWs as “food preparation assistants” for her business, as exemplified by the statement at [5] of the ASOF that “ the accused<em><u> was unaware that this innocent request for assistance would end up being against the rules and regulations</u></em> set by the Ministry of Manpower.”</a></p><a id="p1_81"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a><a id="p1_82">82&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, the Prosecution suggested that due to the widespread publicity that the MOM had put forward through press releases, handbook, or other publicly available documents released from time to time, as well as the work permit conditions and regulatory conditions applicable to the three Foreigners, the accused would have been aware that B1-B3 could not be employed for purposes other than work as an FDW.

In other words, she did not have the requisite <em>mens rea</em> to commit the offence.</a></p><a id="p1_90"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a><a id="p1_91">91&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the further issue of whether the Prosecution also needed to prove that the accused knew that an additional work permit was required for such “employment” to be permitted, I note the Prosecutor’s argument that the MOM had come up with press releases, the handbook, or other publicly available documents, presumably to suggest that she would have such knowledge. However, quite aside from the fact that these documents were not evidence adduced in court or referred to in the ASOF, it was not actually shown that the accused was made aware of them, or that she had the requisite knowledge as a result, nor was there any deeming provision that operated relating to <em>mens rea</em>. Be that as it may, even the Prosecution, based on what it put forward in its written submissions, seemed to accept that there needs to be shown knowledge by the accused that a separate work permit was required.</a></p><a id="p1_91"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a><a id="p1_92">92&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, as I have already found that the help or assistant provided voluntarily by the Foreigners to the accused did not constitute her employing them as “food preparation assistants” at all, let alone for the entire period alleged by the Prosecution, and that there has also not been shown that a work permit was required for such “employment” of the Foreigners as “food preparation assistants”, there was strictly no need for me to actually make a finding that the Prosecution has also failed to prove the specific <em>mens rea</em> requirement, although it was clear from the discussion above, that the evidence certainly pointed to that conclusion.</a></p><a id="p1_92"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Considering alternative charges or course of action</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a><a id="p1_93">93&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the Prosecution’s case, aside from deciding whether there was evidence to call the defence of the accused on the original charges, it is also provided in s 230(1)(g) of the CPC that “…the court may alter the charge or frame a new charge before calling on the accused to give his defence”.</a></p><a id="p1_93"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a><a id="p1_94">94&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering whether the court should exercise its discretion to amend the charge, I was guided by the decision in <em>Goh Chin Soon v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24819-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGHC 162</a> (“<b><em>Goh Chin Soon</em></b><em>”</em>).

I agreed with their assessment.</a></p><a id="p1_95"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a><a id="p1_96">96&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on 30 November 2022, following the Prosecution’s supplementary submissions dated 5 October 2022, that the “…said term “food preparation assistants”, is not a term ordinary used to describe the work that the three FDWs in the present case were engaged in”, the Prosecution apparently suggested that I could consider amending the charges to remove or change the phrase “food preparation assistant” in the charges.</a></p><a id="p1_96"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a><a id="p1_97">97&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with respect, based on the requirements set out in <em>Goh Chin Soon</em>, there was no basis for me to alter or frame alternative charges, even if it was only to amend the term “food preparation assistant” in the charges to something apparently more suitable to describe the role of the person performing the tasks identified in Table 2 of [5] of the ASOF, and then to call on the accused to enter her defence on such amended charges.</a></p><a id="p1_97"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a><a id="p1_98">98&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, I would add that there was no evidence led as to what should be the proper description or title to use in place of the phrase “food preparation assistant” in the charges, even if the requirements in <em>Goh Chin Soon</em> were satisfied.</a></p><a id="p1_98"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a><a id="p1_99">99&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separately, the Prosecution also explained that by getting B1-B3 to assist the accused in the food preparation, she would have breached a regulatory condition that she, as an employer, was subjected to under at reg 4(2) of the Regulations and Regulatory Condition 3. This condition essentially restricts an FDW to perform “only household and domestic duties at…the residential address stated in the work permit”.</a></p><a id="p1_99"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a><a id="p1_100">100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this breach or infringement of a regulatory condition was not <em>per se</em> an offence that was triable before this court, and would not constitute an offence under s 5(3) EFMA.<sup><span class="FootnoteRef"></span></sup></a><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a> Instead, as explained by the Prosecution, by virtue of s 25(2) of the EFMA, a breach of such regulatory conditions was only punishable by means of a financial penalty that the Controller could impose.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101">101&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I broadly agreed with the Prosecution that what the accused did could possibly amount to an infringement or breach of Regulatory Condition 3. In fact, the submissions of the Prosecution set out in the “Prosecution’s Submissions At The Close Of Prosecution’s Case”, especially from [14] – [26], could possibly present a case for suggesting that such an infringement or breach of the regulatory condition had occurred. However, as alluded to above, <u>these same submissions do not show that the alleged offence under s 5(1) of the EFMA had been made out on any of the charges.</u></a></p><a id="p1_101"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a><a id="p1_102">102&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I noted from the prosecutor’s oral submissions on 22 September 2022, that there were EFMA amendments made in 2012 to split offences that used to be under the former EFMA to those that attracted financial penalties, and those that remained as offences under the EFMA.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a> The latter, I presume, refer to offences that remain triable by the courts, such as an offence under s 5(1) of the EFMA.<sup></sup></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103">103&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on this decision taken by Parliament to make legislative amendments to the EFMA to effectively ‘decriminalise’ certain offences, one could even argue that the legislature has, through enacting such amendments, has intended to make a distinction between acts that still constitute offences, for which a prosecution in court is necessary before criminal sanctions can be imposed, and acts which Parliament considers to be infringements or breaches of regulatory conditions that should not punishable by the courts, but which should now be dealt with by the Controller through the possible imposition of a financial penalty instead.</a></p><a id="p1_103"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a><a id="p1_104">104&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also meant that as regards any alleged breach of EFMA provisions or conditions by an employer, the correct choice of enforcement mechanism, and the correct choice of forum, both decisions to be made by the Prosecution, would be vital in determining whether they can achieve the correct result actually intended by Parliament.</a></p><a id="p1_104"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a><a id="p1_105">105&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my respectful view, by asking for the occasional help from a FDW to cut vegetables, peel bananas and wrap them with spring rolls etc. for her business, without the trappings or circumstances of “employment” for such “work”, and in situations where the said FDW then actually agrees to help on her own volitation, as and when she was free and able to do so, what the accused did in the present case, may (or may not) amount to an infringement or breach of a regulatory condition. However, this does not mean that the FDW was thereby employed as a “food preparation assistant” by the accused.</a></p><a id="p1_105"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a><a id="p1_106">106&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separately, why the MOM did not attempt to seek a financial penalty under s 25(2) of the EFMA through the Controller for what the accused did in the present case, was not entirely clear to this court. Be that as it may, having decided to proceed by way of prosecution in the courts, I was of the respectful view that the rather unique facts and evidence of the present case, as agreed to by both the Prosecution and the Defence, would not be sufficient or appropriate to justify even calling for the accused’s defence on the present charges.</a></p><a id="p1_106"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a><a id="p1_107">107&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, whether the MOM still can, or should, take action against the accused by means of seeking a financial penalty under s 25(2) of the EFMA is not something within the purview or control of this court. I thus make no further comment on the matter.</a></p><a id="p1_107"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a><a id="p1_108">108&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having carefully assessed the evidence, the relevant caselaw, the relevant statutory provisions and Parliamentary reports, as well as the submissions of the parties, I was of the respectful view that the Prosecution has failed to satisfy the requirement in s 230(1)(j) of the CPC that there was “…some evidence which is not inherently incredible and which satisfies each and every element of the charge as framed by the prosecutor”.</a></p><a id="p1_108"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a><a id="p1_109">109&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, in line with s 230(1)(k) of the CPC, “the court must order a discharge amounting to an acquittal”.
