On 7 May 2020, he searched for child pornography on the dark web. He downloaded the TOR Browser, which is a web browser that anonymises its users’ web traffic. From there, he found a search engine from which he could access websites containing child abuse material. He paid in Bitcoin for full access to one such website but failed to gain the login details.</a></p><a id="p1_5"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime in June 2021, the Accused joined a Telegram chat group in which pornography, including child abuse material, was freely shared. He was aware that members of the chat group often circulated child abuse material on the group chat. He downloaded similar material from the group chat. The Accused also knew that the two still images and the six videos stored in his devices, were child abuse material.</a></p><a id="p1_6"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Charges </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on these facts, the Accused was charged with two counts under s 377BK(1) and punishable under section 377BK(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“s 377BK(1) p/u s 377BK(2) PC”) and one charge under s 30(1) of the Films Act (Cap 107, 1998 Rev Ed) (“s 30(1) FA”). The Prosecution proceeded on one charge under s 377BK(1) p/u s 377BK(2) PC in DAC 903561-2022. The Accused pleaded guilty to this charge and consented to have the remaining two charges taken into consideration (“TIC”) for purposes of sentencing. The three charges read as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_7"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">DAC 903561-2022:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…you, are charged that you, on 22 October 2021 at about 10am, at [redacted], Singapore, did have in your possession child abuse material, namely, two still images and six videos, which material you knew was child abuse material, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 377BK(1) and punishable under section 377BK(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">DAC 903560-2022:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…you, are charged that you, on 7 May 2020 at about 3.12am, at 68 [redacted], Singapore, did gain access to child abuse material via the URL 365c7q5jvm5c5rbz.onion, which material you knew was child abuse material, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 377BK(1) and punishable under section 377BK(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">MAC 901458-2022:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…you, are charged that you, on 22 October 2021 at about 10am, at [redacted], Singapore, did have in your possession 119 obscene films, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 30(1) of the Films Act (Cap 107, 1998 Rev Ed).</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused was sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment.

The possession of child abuse material is not a victimless crime. Consumers like the Accused harm the young and vulnerable victims by driving up the demand for the supply of such perverse material, leading to the online proliferation of such material at an unprecedented rate. Their willingness to pay for child abuse material bolsters the profit incentive of those who create child abuse material, thereby fuelling the supply of such material.</a></p><a id="p1_11"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DPP cited a news article published in The Guardian on 13 November 2021.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a> The news article reported that experts from the Internet Watch Foundation sounded the alarm on the “tidal wave” of child abuse material circulating online, and that there was 15 times more child sexual abuse material online as compared to a decade ago. The DPP added that with increased technological access, the continued demand for child abuse material, and the new platforms used to make such material available, such as live streaming, there will only be a rapidly growing prevalence of child abuse material online. The DPP argued that the Court must mete out a stiff sentence to deter like-minded offenders and to stem the demand for such material.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DPP further argued that consumers like the Accused are complicit in the horrors that the victims of child abuse material are forced to endure. The victims will live with the knowledge that there is a permanent record of that abuse online. Each time an episode of child abuse is viewed, downloaded, or circulated, it is yet another time that a child is humiliated, degraded, and re-victimised.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DPP pointed out that there is an inherent difficulty in detecting offences of possessing or accessing child abuse material. Those like the Accused can easily access child abuse material without leaving their homes and can even do so anonymously on the dark web, without leaving a trace of their browsing history. In the case of the Accused, he had downloaded the TOR browser and searched for the child abuse material on the dark web. He paid in Bitcoin to gain full access to the website which further afforded him the cloak of anonymity.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific deterrence is also relevant here as the Accused’s offences were premeditated. He had intentionally sought out child abuse material, from accessing such material on the dark web in May 2020, to joining a lewd Telegram group chat in around June 2021, where such material was freely circulated. He remained in that chat group for about four months and downloaded child abuse videos shared on the chat group over a period of two months. His wilful possession of child abuse material merits a harsh deterrent sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DPP argued for a sentence of three to four months’ imprisonment and cited the following aggravating factors.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_16-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a high degree of exploitation. Three of the six videos depict children participating in penetrative sexual activity. Penetrative sexual activity is regarded as the most egregious form of sexual activity. It represents the greatest intrusion into the bodily integrity and privacy of the child, and involves the highest potential for physical, psychological, and emotional damage to the child. The DPP cited the case of <em>AQW v PP </em></a><em><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17724-SSP.xml')">[2015] 4 SLR 150</a> (“AQW”) at [19]</em> in support.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victims in all six videos were of a young age. They appeared to be prepubescent and between six years and 11 years old. The younger the child, the more vulnerable she is and, possibly, the greater the trauma visited upon her (see <em>AQW at [24] and [26]</em>).</a></p><a id="p1_16-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_16-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All six videos were of considerable length, ranging from 51 seconds (S/N 1) to a staggering 37 minutes and 46 seconds (S/N 5). This is aggravating because the longer the video, the longer the children were subjected to abuse, and the longer the permanent record of their abuse.</a></p><a id="p1_16-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_16-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The depravity of the sex acts depicted is yet another aggravating factor. The children were variously engaged in sexual poses while fully naked, forced to have penetrative sex with men, or made to lick one another’s vagina. One of the videos (S/N 5) shows two young girls licking each other’s vagina and rubbing their vaginas against each other, with one of them also using a sex toy on herself. In addition, two videos depict men performing cunnilingus on pre-pubescent girls (S/N 4 and 6). These are same-sex acts and clearly adult sex acts that are more offensive and degrading than, for example, exposure of a child’s genitals or breasts. In one of the videos (S/N 6), there was discernible distress caused to the victim. The victim was visibly in pain as a man penetrates her vagina with his penis. While every piece of child abuse material is inherently repugnant, material showing children in discernible pain or distress is abjectly cruel.</a></p><a id="p1_16-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_16-p2_e">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused demonstrated a strong commitment to accessing child abuse material. He first accessed such material on the dark web on 7 May 2020 (which offence is the subject of the TIC charge in DAC-903560-2022). He next joined the Telegram chat group in June 2021 which freely shared child abuse material. He remained in the chat group up to the time of the police raid in October 2021. He had accessed and possessed child abuse material over a period of nearly one and a half years.</a></p><a id="p1_16-p2_e"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16-p2_e"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DPP pointed out that the Accused also faces a TIC charge under s 30(1) FA for possession of 119 other obscene films. This is not a trivial number. This TIC offence warrants an uplift in sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_17"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DPP argued that the Accused’s plea of guilt is of little mitigating weight as he had little choice but to plead guilty. The evidence against him was overwhelming as he was found to be in possession of the child abuse material. The case of <em>PP v BDB </em></a><em><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21397-SSP.xml')">[2018] 1 SLR 127</a> at [74]</em> was cited in support.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigation</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mitigation Plea sets out the Accused’s personal circumstances.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused is single and comes from Jakarta, Indonesia. His family is still residing in Jakarta. The Accused came to Singapore to pursue a bachelor’s degree in Business from 2012 to 2014. He started working in 2014 before setting up his own business in 2019. This business was badly affected by the pandemic in 2020. His clients who were along the supply chain terminated their contracts with his company. The Accused was devastated. Due to the travel restrictions, the Accused was unable to return home. He also missed his grandmother’s funeral when she passed away in Jakarta in December 2021. The Accused was alone at home in Singapore during the “circuit breaker” period. This caused him emotional anguish and led to low moods. He began to drink alcohol excessively. It was also during this period that the Accused began surfing the Internet for pornographic material. The Accused attributes his lapse in judgement to his poor emotional state caused by his isolation during the pandemic and the loss of his business. He regrets committing the offences and is remorseful. His family too will suffer tremendous trauma and hardship if he receives too harsh a sentence as they are a close-knit family.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence submitted for a sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment.

The Defence pointed out that the aggravating factor here is that the offender had attempted to distribute one obscene video to a friend. The Accused did not do so. In addition, the offender had joined several channels that shared pornography and explicit child abuse material. The Accused participated in one chat group only.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>PP v Kolambage Dhanushka Chamara Perera</em> (“<em>Kolambage</em>”).<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a> This case was reported in the Straits Times on 7 February 2022.

He had 25 video files containing child abuse material and more than 2000 obscene videos while the Accused possessed significantly fewer offensive materials. One of the videos involved a baby or a toddler. The need for deterrence was also stronger as a very young child was involved, indicative of greater trauma to the victim.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>PP v Teo Yong Cong</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a> This case was reported in the Straits Times on 23 March 2022. Here the offender was sentenced to one week’s imprisonment after he pleaded guilty to possession of 3011 obscene videos, some of which were clips of a toddler and a child as young as four years old, engaging in sexual acts. Nine of the video clips contained child sexual abuse material. The length of the nine video clips ranged from 19 seconds to 10 minutes and 31 seconds. The offender had downloaded the app Kik in mid-2018 and joined several chat groups on the app. He downloaded a pornographic image of a female performing a sex act on a young boy wearing a cap. He sent this image to an anonymous user of the chat group who had requested for child sexual abuse material in the chat. This led to his IP address being flagged and investigations commenced. Police investigations revealed that the offender had downloaded about 600 videos pertaining to child sexual abuse over the years. He had started doing so when he was 15 or 16 years old through several apps. He downloaded the material for his personal viewing because he was curious about child sexual abuse materials. The Defence highlighted that the Accused in comparison had only 119 obscene videos in his possession and there was no distribution on his part. Neither did he have any child abuse material involving a child as young as four years old.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>PP v Loh Wei Qi</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a> This case was reported in the Straits Times on 9 December 2022. The offender was employed as a primary school teacher. He pleaded guilty to a single charge for possession 7786 obscene videos of which 131 had child pornographic content. Another charge relating to the distribution of obscene videos was taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing. The offender was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment. The offender had started downloading the obscene videos sometime in 2016. He registered for a Kik account and began using the app to share and receive files and videos with pornographic content. While he had not deliberately sought out child pornography, he did receive and send out such material. In December 2018, his Kik account was suspended. He continued perusing and downloading pornographic materials from other sources. His offences were uncovered in April 2019 and he was arrested in April 2022. The Defence submitted that the offender was a primary school teacher who only resigned in July 2021, about two years after his offences were discovered. This meant that he remained a teacher throughout the time when he was continually viewing child pornography. He was in a position of trust and had acted in blatant disregard of his duty towards the young children entrusted to his care. The need for deterrence is arguably higher in such a case. The number of obscene films found in the offender’s possession was also substantially higher than in the present case. The offender was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment. A term of four weeks’ imprisonment for the Accused here would reflect the necessary uplift in sentence even after factoring in the TIC charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence further highlighted that the offenders in the precedent cases did not leave their chat groups either, even after being made aware that pornographic material was being circulated on the chat groups. It was emphasised that the Accused did not distribute any material which he received from the chat group.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence also submitted that the case of <em>AQW</em> cited by the Prosecution has no relevance to the present case. The offender in <em>AQW</em> faced one charge under Section 376A(1)(C) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) for sexual penetration of a minor and two charges under section 7(a) of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38, 2001 Rev Ed). The prescribed punishments for those offences are vastly different and so the case does not provide much guidance on sentencing or support the Prosecution’s submission for a sentence of three to four months’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prosecution’s reply submissions</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution rebutted the following facts pleaded in mitigation.</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_24-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purported stresses from the “circuit breaker” could not have contributed to the Accused’s offending.

Two of the videos in <em>Malvin Tan</em> were each nine seconds long, while the third video was one minute and two seconds long.

The offender in <em>Malvin Tan</em> accessed such material over seven months, whereas the Accused in this case did so over nearly one and a half years. Although the offender in <em>Malvin Tan</em> unsuccessfully tried to forward a video depicting child abuse, it is far more egregious that the Accused in this case went to the extent of searching for child abuse material on the dark web and paying for such material in Bitcoin.</a></p><a id="p1_28-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of <em>Kolambage</em>, shows that a sentence of three to four months’ imprisonment is justified. There were 25 videos depicting child abuse which were found on the offender’s handphone. 16 of those videos were less than a minute long, but the longest video was six minutes and 49 seconds long. Some of the more egregious videos depicted adult men engaging in in sexual activities with pre-pubescent girls. The sexual activities included penetrative, penile-vaginal sex and penile-anal sex. One victim whimpered in pain during vaginal penetration.</a></p><a id="p1_29"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offender, who was untraced, pleaded guilty to a charge under s 377BK(1) p/u s 377BK(2) PC. An offence under s 30(1) FA was taken into consideration. He was sentenced to one month’s imprisonment. Notwithstanding the greater number of child abuse videos in <em>Kolambage</em>, the present case is significantly more serious for three reasons.</a></p><a id="p1_30"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_30-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Accused in this case has a similar TIC offence concerning his dogged attempt to access child abuse material on the dark web.

In contrast, all but one of the six videos that the accused possessed were more than a minute long. The longest video in this case had a staggering duration of 37 minutes and 46 seconds. This is extremely aggravating because the longer the video, the longer the children would have been subject to abuse, and the longer the permanent record of their abuse. In fact, the children in the longest videos in this case were also subject to the most egregious forms of abuse.</a></p><a id="p1_30-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DPP concluded that as the present case is markedly more aggravated than <em>Kolambage</em>, a sentence of three to four months’ imprisonment is appropriate.</a></p><a id="p1_31"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The legislative framework</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is widely acknowledged that child abuse material are inherently abhorrent and harmful. The children used in the production of these materials carry emotional and psychological scars from the shame and trauma of being involved. Yet they continue to be exploited as the purveyors of these materials find it lucrative to produce such content given the unabated demand. In recent years, the sharp rise in the proliferation of internet sites and other platforms offering child abuse material indicated that there was an urgent need for effective laws to punish those who produce, distribute and access child abuse materials.</a></p><a id="p1_32"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Penal Code Review Committee found that the “patchwork of existing provisions” were inadequate to address the problem.

For the offences relating to child abuse material, a clear distinction is made between the different types of offending activity. The most severe penalty is reserved for the more egregious offences of producing child abuse material and using or involving a child in the production of such material. Both offences are punishable with imprisonment for up to 10 years with discretionary caning and fine. The offence in the present case is accessing and possession simpliciter. Arguably, it is the least serious offence in this range of offences as it attracts the least severe punishment of imprisonment for up to five years with discretionary caning and fine.</a></p><a id="p1_35"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this means is that for a single piece of child abuse material, there will be different types of offending conduct involved, each of differing levels of severity. There may be an overlap in the factors considered by the Court for each type of offending conduct when calibrating sentence, but the weight to be attached to each of those factors will vary according to the offence involved. For example, the length of a video clip containing child abuse material may be a more aggravating factor for the offences of producing child abuse material or using a child to produce such material. A longer video clip demonstrates a higher level of involvement by the offender and possibly a more elaborate execution of the offence.</a></p><a id="p1_36"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, for the offences of accessing or possessing child abuse material simpliciter, there is no obvious distinction in the level of offending for an offender who possesses a longer video clip as opposed to one who has a shorter clip. Possessing a longer video clip, does not without more, impute a higher level of involvement or a greater degree of offending. The offender had likely expended the same amount of time and effort to procure the longer clip as he did the shorter one. Ultimately, each and every sentencing factor must be considered in the context of the specific offence.</a></p><a id="p1_37"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The definition of child abuse material</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of child abuse material is found in s 377C PC.</a></p><a id="p1_38"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b><em>Interpretation of sections 375 to 377BO (sexual offences)</em></b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b><em>377C.</em></b>—(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>In this section and in sections&nbsp;375 to 377BO&nbsp;—</em> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2"> <em>“child abuse material” means material that depicts an image of any of the following:</em> </p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(<em>a</em>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>a person who is, or who appears to a reasonable observer to be, or who is implied to be, below 16&nbsp;years of age&nbsp;—</em> </p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-4">(<em>i</em>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>as a victim of torture, cruelty or physical abuse (whether or not the torture, cruelty or abuse is sexual);</em> </p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-4">(<em>ii</em>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>as a victim of sexual abuse;</em> </p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-4">(<em>iii</em>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>engaged in, or apparently engaging in, a sexual pose or sexual activity (whether or not in the presence of another person); or</em> </p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-4">(<em>iv</em>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>in the presence of another person who is engaged in, or apparently engaged in a sexual pose or sexual activity;</em> </p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(<em>b</em>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>the genital region or buttocks (whether exposed or covered) of a person who is, or who appears to a reasonable observer to be, or who is implied to be, a person below 16&nbsp;years of age, where the depiction is sexual and in circumstances (whether or not apparent from the depiction) which reasonable persons would regard as being offensive;</em> </p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(<em>c</em>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>the breasts (whether exposed or covered) of a person who is, or who appears to a reasonable observer to be, or who is implied to be, a female below 16&nbsp;years of age, where the depiction is sexual and in circumstances (whether or not apparent from the depiction) which reasonable persons would regard as being offensive;</em> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2"> <em>“material” means&nbsp;—</em> </p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(<em>a</em>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>any film, photograph , printed matter or computer game depicting an image;</em> </p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(<em>b</em>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>any electronic record depicting an image; or</em> </p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(<em>c</em>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>any other thing of any kind depicting an image;</em> </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, legislation differentiates based on the differing levels of gravity. The definition of child abuse material begins with the most egregious forms - that which involves violence. The first category deals with depictions of physical violence on a child, where torture, cruelty, or physical abuse is employed. The next category of material deals with content where violence of a sexual nature is involved. This would include rape, sexual torture, and/or deviant sexual practices such as Bondage, Domination, Sadism and Masochism (“BDSM”). Such materials are without doubt of the highest degree of depravity.</a></p><a id="p1_39"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a><a id="p1_40">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next two categories are less egregious. There is no apparent violence or gratuitous cruelty involved. The materials concern children in sexually provocative poses or children engaged in sexual activity either alone or in the presence of another. Presumably, the other person present may either be an adult or another child. It is acknowledged that these two categories of material are not without consequences to the children used in the production. The perpetrators must have used grooming techniques to normalise this form of sexual contact by the child. The perpetrator is also likely to be someone whom the child knows and trusts. While the children may not be old enough at the time to understand the nature and the consequences of their conduct, there will be significant harm and long-term trauma when they are mature enough to grasp the full implications of their participation in the production of the child abuse material. However, in terms of the measure of the violence used, the cruelty employed and the depravity involved, it is certainly less egregious than the earlier two categories.</a></p><a id="p1_40"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a><a id="p1_41">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content depicted in the child abuse material in the present case falls within the latter two categories. There is no evidence of the use of violence, cruelty or abuse either physical or sexual in nature, during the production of these materials. The materials are certainly of the less egregious forms and must be assessed in that context.</a></p><a id="p1_41"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues to be determined.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a><a id="p1_42">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sole issue in this appeal is whether the length of imprisonment imposed is manifestly inadequate.

The six videos were downloaded between 19 August 2021 and 20 October 2021. It would appear that there was no time stamp for when the two still images were downloaded. It must be sometime between June 2021 when the Accused joined the Telegram chat group, and 22 October 2022, when the police raided his home and seized his devices. These facts do not disclose a high degree of planning.

In short, there were no clear steps taken by the Accused to avoid detection when he downloaded the child abuse material.</a></p><a id="p1_48"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Length of possession</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a><a id="p1_49">49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offence provision in s 377BK(1) PC criminalises the act of possession or in the alternative, the act of gaining access to child abuse material. In this case, the proceeded charge is one for possession of child abuse material. Having noted this distinction, the assessment under this component was focused on the possession aspect of the child abuse materials. However, the surrounding circumstances were not completely ignored and were taken into account as well, as explained below.</a></p><a id="p1_49"> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duration of the offending behaviour</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a><a id="p1_50">50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As noted earlier, the six videos were downloaded between 19 August 2021 and 20 October 2021. There is no time stamp for when the two still images were downloaded. The six videos were downloaded on three separate dates – 19 August 2021, 3 September 2021, and 20 October 2021. This was a duration of about two months, which is not a long period of time.</a></p><a id="p1_50"> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persistence in offending behaviour</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a><a id="p1_51">51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused joined the Telegram chat group in June 2021. He would have been aware very early on that lewd content was being shared on this chat group. Yet, he chose to remain in the chat group for nearly four months. Over the four months, his participation in the chat group progressed as well. He began to actively download child abuse materials from the chat group. He initially downloaded single videos on 19 August 2021 and 3 September 2021. This escalated to four videos downloaded on 20 October 2021. The downloading ceased not due to any insight by the Accused into his actions and conduct, but because his devices were seized during the raid and police commenced investigations into his activities.</a></p><a id="p1_51"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a><a id="p1_52">52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused had thus demonstrated not just a persistence in offending but also a progression in his offending behaviour, albeit at a low level. The duration of the offending was short and the Accused had not joined multiple chat groups or internet sites to download child abuse material. The facts show that he had gained possession of child abuse material only from the single Telegram chat group.</a></p><a id="p1_52"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a><a id="p1_53">53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution argued that the TIC charge in this case demonstrates a far longer offending period than what is shown in the proceeded charge. The short response to that is that the TIC charge is for the offence of gaining access to child abuse material and not for possession of child abuse material. It is a charge for a different form of the offence albeit under the same offence provision. The significance of the TIC charge will be assessed later on and not under the present category to avoid any unintended double counting.</a></p><a id="p1_53"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Type of possession</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a><a id="p1_54">54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This component considers how and in what form the child abuse material was stored. The Accused had stored the two still images on his portable drive and the six videos on his mobile phone. There is no evidence that the Accused had taken further steps to avoid detection or to hide the fact by encrypting the files or using separate devices dedicated to the storage of the illicit materials. The Accused’s possession of the child abuse material were quickly discovered during the police raid. There is no evidence that the materials were copied or duplicated onto multiple devices. It was a straightforward storage of materials downloaded from the chat group.</a></p><a id="p1_54"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Motive for possession</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a><a id="p1_55">55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motive refers to the purpose or the Accused’s reasons for obtaining the child abuse material and it is relevant to assessing the extent of the offending involved.

He had downloaded the materials and simply stored them on his mobile phone and his portable drive. He did not distribute or share the materials with others. However, it must be emphasised that this does not lessen the Court’s opprobrium for the offence. Quite apart from the depravity of the content involved, a regular viewing or consumption of child abuse materials is known to lead to an unhealthy addiction to such content.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial gain</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57">57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no evidence that the Accused had possession of the child abuse materials for purposes of commercial gain or profit. He did not sell the materials to others after gaining possession of them. Neither did he pay for the materials which would have advanced the provider’s or the distributor’s profit motive. It is acknowledged that there may have been payments made by others earlier on in the supply chain but the Accused was not involved in those transactions.</a></p><a id="p1_57"> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other illicit purpose</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a><a id="p1_58">58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts did not disclose any reason or purpose for the possession of the child abuse materials by the Accused other than for his personal use. He did not invite others to join him to view the videos and/or the images with him. In other words, he did not try to popularise or promote this form of sexual contact. Neither did he use the child abuse materials to influence or groom another individual, in particular a minor. The Accused’s offending was limited to viewing the illicit content on his own.</a></p><a id="p1_58"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Other factors</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a><a id="p1_59">59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no other factors of note under this category. The Accused’s role in this offence was limited to having possession of the child abuse materials. He had no further personal involvement either in the production or the distribution of the child abuse materials. The materials were readily available to him. He did not have to use any position of influence or seek any special favours to gain possession of the materials.</a></p><a id="p1_59"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Child abuse material</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a><a id="p1_60">60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to examine the offending materials in the present case. The nature of child abuse materials in general, and the mischief caused by them were commented on earlier and disapproval for the same was recorded. I do not propose to discuss those issues again. This category is dedicated to examining the child abuse materials particularised in the proceeded charge - six videos and two still images.</a></p><a id="p1_60"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Nature of the still images and the videos</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a><a id="p1_61">61&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detailed description of the images and the video recordings can be found in the Prosecution’s Statement of Facts.</a></p><a id="p1_61"> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parts of body revealed.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a><a id="p1_62">62&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are ten naked girls shown in the two still images.

Some of the girls are as young as six years and eight years old. The oldest girl appears to be no more than 11 years old. There were easily 15 or 16 young girls used in the production of these materials. These elements combined adds to the gravity of the offence.</a></p><a id="p1_64"> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acts depicted.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a><a id="p1_65">65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no sexual acts seen in the two still images.</a></p><a id="p1_65"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a><a id="p1_66">66&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six video clips show overt sexual acts - from sexual poses to sexual contact and penetrative sex.

He then removes her clothes and touches her vagina, skin-on-skin.</a></p><a id="p1_66-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_66-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A video that is 51 seconds long, shows a girl who appears to be below 11 years of age fully nude.

Both girls are naked from the waist down and touching their exposed vaginas. One girl is seen using a sex toy on herself. Both girls then engage in sexual acts with each other, including licking each other’s vagina and rubbing their vaginas against each other.</a></p><a id="p1_66-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_66-p2_e">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A video that is nine minutes and 41 seconds long, shows a girl who appears to be below ten years of age. A man removes her clothes.

The girl is naked from the waist down and is seen touching her vagina with her legs apart. A man performs cunnilingus on her before penetrating her vagina with his penis.

Nothing was left to the imagination. That said, we must be mindful that much of the abhorrence and reproach directed at this offence arises from the fact that children were used in the production of these materials. However, we must also be mindful that the use or presence of children in such materials is inherent to this offence. A child would be used even in the least egregious offence under this provision. Therefore, no additional weight ought to be attached to the fact that children were involved in the production of the videos.</a></p><a id="p1_67"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a><a id="p1_68">68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What needs to be assessed is whether the acts in themselves added to the depravity of the offence. As noted previously, there was no violence, cruelty or torture involved. The worst seen was in one video where the girl appeared to be in pain during penile-vaginal sex. It would appear that her pain was caused by the sex act itself and not by any additional act of cruelty or torture. While a child’s pain and distress are certainly aggravating factors, I would not go so far as to identify it as evidence of cruelty involved. In the final assessment, the sexual acts depicted lie towards the least aggravated forms as contemplated by legislation. My earlier observations under the header, ‘<em>The definition of child abuse material</em>’ refers. These observations are not intended to trivialize or downplay the distress and shame that the children endured or continue endure. They are simply meant to contextualize the present offence.</a></p><a id="p1_68"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Number of child abuse material involved</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a><a id="p1_69">69&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two still images and six video clips in the present case, when compared to the precedent cases, is a low number. The offenders in the cases cited had obtained possession of a far higher number of child abuse material over an equally short time.</a></p><a id="p1_69"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Length or duration of the recording</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a><a id="p1_70">70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The video clips ran from 51 seconds to 37 minutes and 46 seconds. At first blush, a video recording that is more than half an hour long may seem like a highly aggravating factor. On closer examination, as I have previously noted, a longer video recording in the offence of <em>possession</em> of child abuse materials does not, without more, impute a higher degree of offending on the part of the Accused. The Accused was not involved in the production or the recording of any of the child abuse material. He did not determine how long the sexual activity should continue for, or how much of it should be recorded. There is also no evidence to suggest that possession of a longer video recording involved more steps or greater sophistication in obtaining possession.</a></p><a id="p1_70"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a><a id="p1_71">71&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can be observed from the facts is that the Accused started out by downloading the shortest video clip on 19 August 2021 which lasted 51 seconds. He next downloaded a video recording on 3 September 2021 which was also relatively short at two minutes and six seconds long. The last set of downloads were on 20 October 2021. These were four video clips which were one minute and 25 seconds long, nine minutes and 41 seconds long, 37 minutes and 46 seconds long, and four minutes and 15 seconds long. All else being equal, that is to say that the number of video clips and the duration of video clips made available on the chat group remained the same from the first date to the last, the most that can be said about the increasing length or duration of the video recordings is that the Accused became emboldened after the initial downloads. It shows a progression in offending, albeit at a low level. This low level progression in offending was accounted for earlier on under the header, <em>Persistence in offending behaviour</em>.</a></p><a id="p1_71"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Nature and extent of distribution</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a><a id="p1_72">72&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no evidence that the Accused had distributed or disseminated the child abuse materials in his possession.</a></p><a id="p1_72"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Other aggravating factors</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a><a id="p1_73">73&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only other aggravating factor of significance in this case is the two TIC charges. The first TIC charge is similar to the proceeded charge. It is also for an offence under s 377BK(1) p/u s 377BK(2) PC. On 7 May 2020, the Accused had gained access to child abuse material on the dark web. He downloaded the TOR Browser to anonymise his searches. He then found a search engine from which he could access websites containing child abuse material. He paid in Bitcoin for full access to one such website but failed to get the log-in details. According to the particulars in the TIC charge, he did gain access to child abuse material on a website. It is unclear if he paid in Bitcoin or made any payment at all for this website as well. Suffice to say that he did take steps to avoid detection when he downloaded the TOR browser. This does increase his level of offending. But there is no evidence to suggest that he had paid for any of the materials which he finally gained access to and had thus directly or indirectly advanced the profit incentive of others in the supply chain.</a></p><a id="p1_73"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a><a id="p1_74">74&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Prosecution’s submissions that this TIC charge demonstrates the Accused’s singular commitment to gaining access to child abuse material. He had first accessed the materials on the dark web on 7 May 2020. He next joined the Telegram chat group in June 2021 and downloaded materials from the chat group. His intent and efforts to obtain child abuse materials was not limited to the “circuit breaker” period in May 2020. He actively looked for and obtained child abuse materials almost a year and a half later.</a></p><a id="p1_74"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a><a id="p1_75">75&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I could not agree with the Prosecution that the TIC charge demonstrates a continuous pattern of offending and that the Accused’s period of offending spanned about a year and a half, from the time he made searches on the dark web to the time when he last downloaded materials from the chat group on 20 October 2021. There is simply no evidence of this. They were two distinct and separate occasions on which the Accused committed similar offences. At most it shows his proclivity for committing such an offence. It was not a sustained period of offending and it would be wrong to assume otherwise and to correspondingly inflate the gravity of his offences.</a></p><a id="p1_75"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a><a id="p1_76">76&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second TIC charge involves possession of 119 obscene films other than child abuse materials. This offence is punishable under s 30(1) FA with a fine not exceeding $20,000 or imprisonment not exceeding six months. The number of obscene films here while not small are not so large either and especially so when compared to the precedent cases cited by parties. This TIC charge would influence the sentence only slightly.</a></p><a id="p1_76"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigating factors</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a><a id="p1_77">77&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused has no previous convictions. He has pleaded guilty to his offences. He has not reoffended since the police raided his home on 22 October 2021. I disagreed with the Prosecution that the weight of the evidence against the Accused has completely diminished the worth of his guilty plea and its show of remorse. His plea of guilt has saved the Court’s time and the State’s resources which otherwise would have been spent on a trial. It is also significant that he has remained offence free since his crimes were uncovered. I gave these factors their due weight in determining the sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_77"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentencing precedents cited</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a><a id="p1_78">78&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a dearth of sentencing precedents for this offence, much less reported decisions. Not surprisingly the Defence cited newspaper reports of similar cases prosecuted in the past. The Prosecution responded by producing the Statement of Facts for two of the precedents cited, <em>Malvin Tan</em> and <em>Kolambage</em>, and referred to these in their Reply Submissions.</a></p><a id="p1_78"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a><a id="p1_79">79&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is generally accepted that unreported cases have limited precedential value as there are no reasoned grounds for the court’s decision. They offer little insight into the reasoning behind the sentences imposed. But in instances like the present, where there is a dearth of reported precedents, the unreported decisions do become useful reference points in the sentencing analysis.</a></p><a id="p1_79"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a><a id="p1_80">80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Statement of Facts for the two precedent cases did assist, but I found it necessary to check the other details such as the particulars of the charges and the criminal records of the offenders in the electronic filing system, ICMS.

He had no prior criminal convictions. He faced two charges. He pleaded guilty to one charge under s 377BK(1) p/u s 377BK(2) PC and consented to have another charge under s 30(1) FA to be taken into consideration for sentencing. The Statement of Facts revealed that the offender had joined various Telegram channels which shared pornographic photographs and videos. He downloaded the photographs and videos into his mobile phone over a period of seven months. The offender also attempted to send one obscene video to a friend. The video depicted a man having sex with a girl who appeared to be about seven to eight years old, but his friend was unable to view the video. The offender was subsequently arrested and his mobile phone was seized. His phone was found to contain 422 files of obscene videos, three of which were sexually explicit, showing children well below 16 years of age.</a></p><a id="p1_81"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a><a id="p1_82">82&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three videos depicted the following:</a></p><a id="p1_82"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82"></a><a id="p1_82-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first video was nine seconds long and showed two children – one boy and one girl – on a bed.

He pleaded guilty to one charge under s 377BK(1) p/u s 377BK(2) PC and consented to have another charge under s 30(1) FA to be taken into consideration for sentencing. The Statement of Facts revealed that the offender was a Sri Lankan national who was in Singapore on a student pass. He joined a WhatsApp chat group for fellow citizens from his home country. The group was initially formed for the members to share information or news from their hometown, but they later began sharing obscene videos, including those depicting child pornography. The offender’s WhatsApp settings permitted videos and photographs sent by others to be automatically downloaded into his mobile phone’s gallery. These included the obscene films and child abuse material shared on the group chat. At the time of his arrest, 2968 obscene films were found in his mobile phone. These had been downloaded onto his mobile phone over the many months that he had participated in the group chat. Of these, 25 films depicted child abuse material. He stated that he was “not really interested” in obscene videos involving underaged subjects and had tried his best to delete them, but there were just too many of such videos. A second charge of being in possession of 2931 obscene films was taken into consideration during sentencing.

He had no prior criminal convictions. He faced three charges. He pleaded guilty to one charge under s 377BK(1) p/u s 377BK(2) PC and one charge under Section 292(1)(a) Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008) (“s 292(1)(a) PC”). He consented to have another charge under s 30(1) FA to be taken into consideration for sentencing. The Statement of Facts revealed that the offender is a Bangladeshi national working in Singapore. On 22 June 2020, the Singapore Police received information from the International Criminal Police Organisation (“INTERPOL”) that the offender had shared two videos featuring minors engaging in sexual activities with adults. He was arrested and his two mobile phones were seized. The two mobile phones were found to contain 1290 obscene videos of which 83 videos featured child abuse material. The 83 videos showed adult men engaging in sexual activities with children of both genders, as well as children engaging in sexual activities with other children. The children in the videos were between one year and 14 years. Most of them were pre-pubescent. The most egregious videos featured the following acts:</a></p><a id="p1_89"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89"></a><a id="p1_89-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A video 11 seconds long in which a one year old male toddler sucking on a pacifier is sodomised by an adult male.</a></p><a id="p1_89-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_89-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A video four minutes and 59 seconds long in which an eight year old girl performs fellatio on an adult male, before the adult male penetrates the girl’s vagina with his penis.

As he wanted to view more obscene videos, he joined other group chats on a variety of social messaging applications recommended to him by members of the first group. One such group circulated child abuse material which he became addicted to. The offender downloaded the child abuse videos for his own viewing pleasure, as well as to share with others on the social messaging platforms.</a></p><a id="p1_90"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a><a id="p1_91">91&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution submitted for a sentence of at least 10 months’ imprisonment for the s 377BK(1) p/u s 377BK(2) PC and at least two months’ imprisonment for the s 292(1)(a) PC offence with both sentences to run consecutively, making a global sentence of at least 12 months’ imprisonment.

He had been continuously accessing child abuse materials for about three years. He was found in possession of 83 videos containing child abuse material. He had even distributed two of those videos to an acquaintance. The content of the videos in his possession were particularly troubling. Male children were sodomised, one as young as one year’s old. He received the highest sentence in this trio of cases of five months’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_93"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a><a id="p1_94">94&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offenders in the remaining two case precedents each received four weeks’ imprisonment for a similar offence. I could not agree with the Prosecution that the present case is more aggravated than these two precedents.</a></p><a id="p1_94"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a><a id="p1_95">95&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts in <em>PP v Kolambage</em> were certainly more aggravated. The number of videos involved were far higher - 25 videos containing child abuse material. The content depicted was more egregious – sodomy and several instances of painful penile-vaginal penetrative sex. The number of obscene videos found in the offender’s possession were also much higher than the present case – 2931 obscene videos.</a></p><a id="p1_95"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a><a id="p1_96">96&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts in <em>PP v Malvin Tan</em> too were more aggravated than the present case. The offender had joined multiple channels which disseminated child abuse material. He was found in possession of a higher number of obscene videos, 422 in total. The obscene videos and the three videos containing child abuse materials were downloaded over a seven month period as opposed to the Accused’s two-month spree. In addition, the offender had tried to distribute one of the videos containing child abuse material to a friend. The three videos arguably depicted far more egregious content than what is seen in the present case. One video showed two children engaging in sodomy. Another video showed a young boy performing a sexual dance in the nude for an audience comprising several adult males. The third video had a girl showing her vagina to the camera. The sole mitigating factor when compared to the present case is that there were only three child abuse videos involved. This fact alone is not sufficient to reduce the overall gravity of the case.</a></p><a id="p1_96"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision on Sentence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a><a id="p1_97">97&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Prosecution that the predominant sentencing goals for this offence are specific deterrence and general deterrence. The sentence imposed must strike the balance between achieving these goals and reflecting the correct level of offending involved. The challenge always with an offence of this nature, is to ensure that the abhorrence felt for the subject matter, in this case the child abuse material, does not overshadow the specific sentencing considerations. I will now recap the sentencing factors identified in the present case.</a></p><a id="p1_97"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a><a id="p1_98">98&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child abuse material particularised in the proceeded charge were two still images and six video clips. This was assessed to be a low number of offending materials. They contained graphic images of pre-pubescent girls engaged in sexual activity which pointed to a high degree of exploitation. The acts depicted were overt sexual acts ranging from sexual poses to sexual contact and penetrative sex. It was noted that there was an absence of other aggravating elements in the images seen, such as torture, gratuitous cruelty, violence or even deviant sexual practices. The sexual acts depicted were the less aggravated forms of sexual activity as defined by legislation. Overall, the child abuse material may not be of the least aggravated form but it was not especially egregious either. It was assessed to fall within the less aggravated end or at the lower end of the spectrum of such cases.</a></p><a id="p1_98"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a><a id="p1_99">99&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused came into possession of the child abuse material by downloading them from the Telegram chat group. He did this over a short span of two months. The manner in which he gained possession was simple and straightforward. It did not entail any sophisticated searches or browsers. Neither did it require any special access or permission. Once he had gained possession of the materials, the Accused stored them in his personal devices. He did not attempt to hide or encrypt them to avoid detection. He had possession of the child abuse material solely for his personal use. He did not disseminate or distribute the materials. Overall, the method by which the Accused gained possession the child abuse material and the manner in which he managed the materials did not reveal any aggravated circumstances.</a></p><a id="p1_99"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a><a id="p1_100">100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused, however, did demonstrate a persistence in accessing and obtaining the child abuse material. He first accessed them on the dark web on 7 May 2020. This was done surreptitiously using the Tor browser to hide his search activity. About one and a half years later, he again obtained child abuse materials by downloading them from the Telegram chat group. He initially downloaded just one video at a time but this progressed to four videos at one go. While there was a persistence in his offending, it was sporadic. The progression in his offending was slight and remained at a low level.</a></p><a id="p1_100"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a><a id="p1_101">101&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of the obscene videos found in the Accused’s possession were not exceptionally large. Far greater numbers were seen in the other cases.</a></p><a id="p1_101"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a><a id="p1_102">102&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can therefore be concluded that the two TIC charges merit only a modest uplift in sentence. The mitigating factors serve to somewhat lessen the gravity of the offences as well.</a></p><a id="p1_102"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a><a id="p1_103">103&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having determined that the present case fell close to the least aggravated end of the spectrum of cases, the next step was to determine the appropriate length of imprisonment. The sentencing precedents were reviewed for purposes of parity and consistency in sentence. The precedent cases showed that the sentences ranged from five months’ imprisonment for a highly aggravated case to four weeks’ imprisonment for the less egregious offending. If this sentencing range is adopted, then a sentence of less than four weeks’ imprisonment would be appropriate for the present case. It is after all, the least aggravated amongst this set of cases. That said, I took the view that a sentence of less than four weeks’ imprisonment would not accurately reflect the two aggravating factors identified in this case – the explicit and intrusive nature of the content involved and the Accused’s persistence in obtaining them.</a></p><a id="p1_103"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a><a id="p1_104">104&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution submitted for a sentence of three to four months’ imprisonment arguing that the circumstances of this case are far more aggravated than those seen in <em>PP v Malvin Tan</em> and <em>PP v Kolambage</em>. For the reasons stated above, I could not agree with this characterisation of the level of offending or the gravity of the offences in the present case. This case has the least aggravated circumstances.</a></p><a id="p1_104"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a><a id="p1_105">105&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of a term of imprisonment on a first time offender cannot be overstated. It is sobering and is in itself a deterrent sentence. The Accused in this case has not shown himself to be a recalcitrant offender with a high propensity to reoffend. He has remained offence free since his arrest in 2021. In the absence of highly aggravating factors which call for a lengthy term of imprisonment, an appropriately calibrated term of imprisonment would be sufficient to have the intended deterrent effect, including one of general deterrence.</a></p><a id="p1_105"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a><a id="p1_106">106&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, I found that the low degree of offending and the less aggravated nature of the child abuse materials, coupled with the lack of any other compelling aggravating factors, and balanced against the mitigating factors, a sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate. It is in my view, adequate to meet the sentencing objectives in this case.</a></p><a id="p1_106"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a><a id="p1_107">107&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was not an egregious case and caning was certainly not warranted. The imposition of a fine in addition to the sentence of imprisonment was also deemed unnecessary as the Accused was not shown to have <em>procured financial benefits from his offending conduct</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108">108&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offences relating to child abuse material are particularly reprehensible as they capitalise on the naivete and the trusting nature of young children. Parliament recognised this vulnerability in our children and swiftly effected new laws to protect them. The new legislation while prescribing higher punishments is not a blunt instrument. It adopts a considered and graduated approach to take into account the different levels of offending. It is important to maintain the same balance in sentencing. The sentence imposed must not only account for the harm and distress caused to the victims but it must also have regard for the individual sentencing factors in each case. The sentencing factors in the present case were identified and carefully analysed. A sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment was found to be just and appropriate given the circumstances of this case.</a></p><a id="p1_108"> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"></a><p class="Footnote"><a id="p1_108"><sup></sup></a><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a>The Guardian, “Fifteen times more child sexual abuse material found online than 10 years ago” (published 13 November 2021).</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>PP v Tan Jian Hong Malvin (SC-907457-2021)</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>PP v Kolambage Dhanushka Chamara (SC-907989-2021)</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>PP v Teo Yong Cong (SC-908091-2021)</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_5_1" id="Ftn_5">[note: 5]</a></sup>PP v Loh Wei Qi (SC-908087-2021)</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_6_1" id="Ftn_6">[note: 6]</a></sup>Penal Code Review Committee Report (August 2018), p 124</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_7_1" id="Ftn_7">[note: 7]</a></sup>See Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam SC), Second Reading of the Criminal Law Reform Bill, Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Reports (6 May 2019) vol 94</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_8_1" id="Ftn_8">[note: 8]</a></sup>See PP v Zahidul (SC-904634-2020)</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_9_1" id="Ftn_9">[note: 9]</a></sup>PP v Zahidul (SC-904634-2020)</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_10_1" id="Ftn_10">[note: 10]</a></sup>Nicholas Tan Siew Chye v PP <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29336-SSP.xml')">[2023] SGHC 35</a> at [84] - [85]</p></div></content></html>
