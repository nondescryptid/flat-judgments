There were no policy reasons to suggest otherwise.</a></p><a id="p1_34"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant was concurrently also the occupier of the worksite.

VK Rajah JA went on to observe that under the first limb of <em>Spandeck</em>, the vast majority of occupiers having control of the property which they occupy and/or the activities carried out there <em>de jure</em> owed a prima facie duty of care to lawful entrants. The Defendant therefore also owed the Plaintiff a duty of care qua occupier in the present case.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Breach of duty of care</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standard of care required of the Defendant is the general objective standard of a reasonable person using ordinary care and skill: see The Law of Torts in Singapore at [06.006].</a></p><a id="p1_36"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, the question of whether the Defendant had fallen below the standard of a reasonable person exercising ordinary skill and care is in large part dependent on how the Accident occurred. As noted in the Law of Torts in Singapore, “in contrast to the existence of a duty of care, the question of whether there was a failure on the part of a defendant to take reasonable care towards the plaintiff is a factual, not a legal issue” (at [06.003]). It is only when the manner in which the Accident occurred is established that one can proceed to examine whether the Plaintiff had proven that the Defendant had failed to exercise ordinary skill and care which might have prevented the Accident from happening in the manner that the Plaintiff said that it did. Indeed, the particulars of negligence and breaches of the WSHA pleaded by the Plaintiff were premised on the Plaintiff’s pleaded version of the Accident, namely that he had fallen through a unbarricaded opening in the platform floor: see paragraphs [7], [9] and [10] of the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1).</a></p><a id="p1_37"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the parties have put forward conflicting accounts of how the Accident occurred, in assessing whether the Defendant had breached its duty of care, a key issue to be determined was whether: (a) the Plaintiff fell through an unbarricaded opening in the platform (the Plaintiff’s pleaded case) or (b) the Plaintiff slipped while descending the monkey ladder (the Defendant’s pleaded case).</a></p><a id="p1_38"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Finding on the Disputed Factual Issue</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the claimant in the present lawsuit, the burden is on the Plaintiff to prove that the Defendant had breached the duty of care owed to it.

The Plaintiff’s account of how he fell and sustained his injuries was largely based on his own assertions. The Plaintiff’s account of the Accident would have been more probative if it were backed by a contemporaneous written statement or record containing his account of how the Accident happened. There were no such records in the present case. Instead, there were other contemporaneous written records which supported the Defendant’s version of events, which I will come to shortly.</a></p><a id="p1_41"> <p class="Judg-Heading-4"> <u>Photograph of the opening</u> </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a><a id="p1_42">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff relied on a photograph at page 45 of his affidavit<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a> (the “<b>Photo</b>”) which he claimed showed the opening from which he fell.

However, it became evident following cross examination that the Photo provided an inadequate depiction of the actual state of the opening.

It was thus impossible to rule out, based on the Photo alone, that there could not have been horizontal cross bars serving as barricades further above the opening which was outside the frame of the Photo. This was especially so given that the location of the cross bars at other barricaded openings at the Worksite appeared to be at a significant height above the floor level of the relevant opening: see, for example, the photograph of an unrelated opening at page 43 of the Plaintiff’s affidavit<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>.

Anbumani confirmed that there were protective cross bars above the opening at 1.1 metres above the platform, which would have placed them outside the frame of the Photo. He did not capture the cross bars when taking the photo as he was focusing on the ladder, in light of the Plaintiff’s account to him that he “fell from the ladder”:</a></p><a id="p1_44"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44"></a><a id=""> <u>Notes of Evidence (“</u> <b><u>NE</u></b> <u>”) 29 July 2022 p. 51-52 (Cross-examination of Anbumani by Plaintiff’s Counsel)</u> </a></p><a id=""> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2" frame="none" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="12.02%"><col width="87.98%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class="" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Q:</p> </td><td class="" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Okay.

Defendant’s Counsel’s reply, which I accepted, was that the first communication by the Plaintiff to the Defendant stating that the Plaintiff fell through an unbarricaded opening was when the writ was filed by the Plaintiff on 30 April 2021, some fifteen months after the Accident. Prior to this, the accounts of the witnesses interviewed by the Defendant were that the Plaintiff had slipped while descending the monkey ladder; no issues were raised as to the existence of an unbarricaded opening on the floor.

As noted above, Elavarasan had corroborated the Plaintiff’s story that: (a) not all opening in the scaffolding structure were barricaded just before the Accident; and (b) after the Accident, on the very same day, WSHO Manikandan (DW2) had instructed the workers to barricade all openings which were not cordoned off. Elavarasan deposed that he personally barricaded the opening at level 6 from which the Plaintiff fell.</a></p><a id="p1_48"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a><a id="p1_49">49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I acknowledged that Elavarasan had since left the Defendant’s company and thus an argument could be made that he should be treated as an independent witness. However, having observed Elavarasan on the stand, and having regard to his testimony as a whole, I had significant doubts as to Elavarasan’s candour and the cogency and consistency of his evidence.</a></p><a id="p1_49"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a><a id="p1_50">50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Elavarasan had in his affidavit testified that Manikandan (DW3) informed him and his co-workers at the 1.00 pm briefing convened after the Accident (the “<b>1pm briefing</b>”) that the Plaintiff had fallen through “<em>an access opening ... that was not barricaded or cordoned off</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a>.

However, during cross-examination, when it was put to Elavarasan that there was no statement made by anyone at the 1pm briefing that Plaintiff had fallen through an opening, Elavarasan agreed<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. He conceded that it was just his “guess”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>. It was further put to Elavarasan that the only thing that occurred at the 1pm meeting was that Manikandan told all the workers that the Plaintiff slipped and fell when descending the monkey ladder as he had not hooked on the harness, and a demonstration was thus given on how to climb or descend a ladder at the 1pm briefing. Again, Elavarasan agreed<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51">51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Elavarasan further stated during cross-examination that at the 1pm briefing, Anbumani had asked the workers to barricade all the openings that were not cordoned off<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a>. When it was put to him that this statement should have been included in his affidavit if it were indeed true, and that by raising it for the first time at trial he was lying, Elavarasan agreed<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52">52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Elavarasan further deposed at [19] of his affidavit that at the safety meeting held on the day after the Accident, the workers were told to disregard the instructions received at the prior day’s briefing and to “maintain that the Plaintiff had fallen whilst descending the … monkey ladder”. However, when pressed in court, he changed his story and stated that all he and his co-workers were told was that they should “work safely”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53">53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, Elavarasan’s testimony struck me as being convoluted and inconsistent.

I noted that the Plaintiff had challenged the accounts given by Bimal and Kulangi.

The Plaintiff claimed that it was Manikandan (DW3), who accompanied him to the hospital, who spoke to the attending doctor. The Plaintiff asserted that Manikandan was conversant in English, and he was not. Thus, Manikandan communicated with the doctor on how the Plaintiff sustained his injuries.</a></p><a id="p1_61"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a><a id="p1_62">62&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manikandan’s testimony in court was to the contrary.

In this regard, I noted that the Plaintiff’s contention that the accounts in the medical notes taken by the Changi General Hospital doctor was provided by Manikandan was based on no more than his bare assertions. The Plaintiff had been working in Singapore since 2006, for some 14 years up to the time of the Accident<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a>. I found it improbable that Plaintiff was incapable of informing the doctor in basic English whether he fell from an opening or slipped while descending a ladder, nor that the treating doctor would elicit information on the cause of the Accident from a third party (Manikandan), as opposed to the patient himself.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64">64&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the Medical Reports were produced by the Plaintiff himself and relied upon by him<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a>. Instead of writing to the doctors or calling them to testify on where they obtained the contradictory version of the Accident from, the Plaintiff merely asserted during cross examination that the version recorded by the doctors was not as communicated by him. Such an explanation lacked persuasion and credibility. On the face of the two Medical Reports, the provider of the information in the reports was <em>prima facie</em> the Plaintiff. Given that the burden of proof was on the Plaintiff, if he disagreed with the version recorded, the Plaintiff ought to have called the two doctors to verify the source of the information recorded by them. He could not attack the contents and accuracy of the Medical Reports without giving the doctors a chance to respond or explain the alleged discrepancies. Not having done so, I found that the Medical Reports supported the Defendant’s case theory that the Plaintiff did in fact fall while descending the monkey ladder.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4"> <u>The Victim Statement</u> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65">65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant further relied on the Plaintiff’s victim statement (the “<b>Statement</b>”) purportedly signed by the Plaintiff in which it was stated that the Plaintiff was climbing down a monkey ladder on level 6 when he lost his footing and fell 1 metre [and that] his lanyard was not fully or properly hooked<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a>. The relevant extract of the Statement, which was typewritten in both English and Tamil, read as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“On 7/1/2020, I was assigned to perform silicon application of window flashings by my supervisor Periysamy.

As the Court of Appeal held in Gimpex Ltd v Unity Holdings Business Ltd and others and another appeal <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17365-SSP.xml')">[2015] 2 SLR 686</a> at [183]–[184], the standard of proof in all civil cases – even when fraud is alleged – is proof on the balance of probabilities, nothing higher. The law does not require a party to a civil case who alleges fraud to adduce more evidence in order to tip the balance in his favour.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">106&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true, however, that the law acknowledges that, on the probabilities inherent in the general course of human experience, the more serious an allegation is, the less likely it is that the allegation is true. <em>That is why the law require a person alleging fraud to adduce stronger or more cogent evidence of fraud to discharge his burden than a person alleging, for example, negligence. (emphasis added)</em></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68">68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having regard to the evidence as a whole, I was of the view that the Plaintiff had not discharged his burden of showing, on a balance of probabilities, that his signature was forged. I considered the following.</a></p><a id="p1_68"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a><a id="p1_69">69&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, besides the Plaintiff’s bare allegation that his signature was forged, the Plaintiff did not adduce any evidence to prove his assertion. Given the significance of the admissions contained in the Statement, if the signature on the Statement was indeed forged, the Plaintiff could have appointed a handwriting or other expert to opine and testify as to the authenticity of his signature. The Plaintiff, however, chose not to do so.</a></p><a id="p1_69"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a><a id="p1_70">70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there was nothing on the face of the signature that raised doubts as to its authenticity. Defence Counsel had thus brought the Plaintiff through various signatures he had executed on different documents on different occasions, and showed that there were some variances between the Defendant’s signatures on each occasion.</a></p><a id="p1_70"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a><a id="p1_71">71&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, as noted above, Manikandan (DW3) testified that he witnessed the Plaintiff executing the statement after it was read to the Plaintiff in Tamil. Manikandan has since left the Defendant’s employ and thus had no interest in the litigation. As an independent witness, his evidence ought to be given due weight.</a></p><a id="p1_71"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a><a id="p1_72">72&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, despite the Statement containing evidence that was so damning to his case, the Plaintiff did not raise any allegations of forgery until he affirmed his AEIC on 10 January 2022, some two years later. Nor did the Plaintiff lodge a police report despite asserting that his signature had been forged in a document that was extremely material to his claim for workmen compensation or in the ongoing litigation, which was a step a reasonable person would likely have taken in similar circumstances.</a></p><a id="p1_72"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a><a id="p1_73">73&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plaintiff’s Counsel, however, argued that the Plaintiff was repatriated to India long before the Statement was produced by the Defendant in discovery. When the document was disclosed, the Plaintiff was in India and his focus was on getting the necessary medical treatments and giving his evidence in Court when the time arises for the same. The Plaintiff felt that the correct forum to raise his dispute of the Statement was in his AEIC and/or during the trial<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74">74&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not accept the Plaintiff Counsel’s arguments. These were all evidence from the bar. The transcripts showed that the Defendant’s Counsel had pressed the Plaintiff during cross-examination on why no police report was made, why the authorities to whom the Investigation Report was sent were not notified of the forgery, and why no handwriting expert was engaged. The Plaintiff conceded that he saw the Statement with his signature whilst he was still in Singapore, and that it was his supervisor Periyasamy who showed it to him<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a>. The Plaintiff testified that he did inform his legal counsel that the signature was not his, but his legal counsel did not advise him to do anything<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span>. The Plaintiff never cited the reasons in [73] for not reporting the forgery to the relevant authorities. Even if the Plaintiff was not in Singapore and could not have attended to the aforementioned steps, there was no reasons why his counsel could not have taken these steps on his behalf if they were genuinely of the view that the Defendant had committed a serious offence of forgery to prejudice the Plaintiff’s claim for compensation before MOM or the courts.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75">75&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As noted above, the burden of proving forgery is on the Plaintiff and is a high one. For the reasons noted above, the Plaintiff had not, in my view, been able to surmount his burden of providing on a balance of probabilities that his signature appearing on the Statement was in fact forged. The Statement should thus be accorded due weight.</a></p><a id="p1_75"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a><a id="p1_76">76&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For completeness, I would deal with the other issues raised by the Plaintiff relating to the Statement to undermine the probative force of the Statement.</a></p><a id="p1_76"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a><a id="p1_77">77&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Plaintiff contended that Anbumani “testified and admitted that the Statement was wholly an afterthought, after Anbumani had completed preparing the Investigation Report” and realized that the Report made no mention of the Plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78">78&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found the Plaintiff’s submission that Anbumani had “admitted” that the Statement was “wholly an afterthought” to be without basis. Anbumani never admitted that the preparation of the Statement was an “afterthought”, which word carried with it connotations of fabrication and lack of reliability. He clearly stated that he decided to prepare the Statement as he realized the Investigation Report made no reference to the Plaintiff’s account of the Accident. Hence, he prepared the Statement based on what the Plaintiff had told him earlier in the day so that the record of the Accident would be complete and the Plaintiff’s account of the Accident could be captured once and for all:</a></p><a id="p1_78"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_78"></a><a id=""> <u>NE 29 July 2022 p. 64 (Cross-examination of Anbumani by Plaintiff’s Counsel)</u> </a></p><a id=""> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2" frame="none" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="8.72%"><col width="91.28%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class="" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Q:</p> </td><td class="" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Alright.

Plaintiff stated that it was even more incredible that Anbumani saw the necessity to include statements from Kulangi and Bimal in the Report but did not see the necessity to include any Statement or information from the Plaintiff himself.

The Plaintiff did not provide any evidence of any industry practice or MOM requirement to show that the victim statement must be included in the Investigation Report in all cases.

Admittedly, Elavarasan did prevaricate eventually and stated that the issue of the barricading was also discussed. Be that as it way, given the close proximity in time between the 1pm meeting and the Accident, and the fact that an important objective of the 1pm meeting was to brief the workers on the safety aspects of ascending and descending a monkey ladder, this, in my view, lent credence to Anbumani’s testimony that the cause of the Plaintiff’s fall was likely due to accidental slippage while descending the monkey ladder, which was why the 1pm safety briefing was convened to remind the workers of the proper procedures for doing so.</a></p><a id="p1_87"> <p class="Judg-Heading-4"> <u>The Plaintiff’s injuries</u> </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a><a id="p1_88">88&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While no accident reconstructionist was called, the court was entitled, when assessing the inherent probabilities and improbabilities of the parties’ respective cases, to take notice of the Plaintiff’s injuries in determining whether the Plaintiff’s account of how he fell was believable as a matter of common sense, logic and common human experience.</a></p><a id="p1_88"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a><a id="p1_89">89&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff’s testimony at the trial was that he was walking sideways towards his left, whilst facing the building, when he stepped into an opening, and he fell from one level to another level “<em>with great impact to my left side, back and left hand, which struck the scaffolding pipe, resulting in serious injuries</em>”. The picture of the spot where the Plaintiff claimed he landed (as shown on DB111 [left and right photos]; or Bundle of Affidavits (“<b>BA</b>”) (Tab A) p. 45) showed the presence of four cross-pipes in close proximity of the monkey ladder at the bottom floor where the Plaintiff allegedly landed.</a></p><a id="p1_89"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a><a id="p1_90">90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the Plaintiff’s account, the only injury that the Plaintiff suffered was a closed fracture of the left elbow.

In my mind, the fact that the sole injury sustained by the Plaintiff was confined to the left elbow, with no other bruises and cuts whatsoever, was wholly inconsistent, as a matter of common sense, logic, and common human experience, with the Plaintiff’s story that he fell “<em>with great impact to my left side, back and left hand, which struck the scaffolding pipe, resulting in serious injuries</em>”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91">91&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the Plaintiff sustained only an injury to the left elbow was, on the other hand, more consistent with the Defendant’s case theory that the Plaintiff was climbing down the monkey ladder and slipped on his left step.

The Defendant, however, made no attempt to tender the correct Permit to Work in court.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97">97&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Plaintiff that an adverse inference ought in the circumstances be drawn against the Defendant that they did not have the requisite Permit to Work for the Defendant’s Worksite at the material time in breach of their statutory duties: see <em>Miah Rasel</em>.</a></p><a id="p1_97"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the Defendant had carried out and/or enforced a sufficient Risk Assessment </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a><a id="p1_98">98&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff contended that the Risk Assessment exhibited<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a> was falsified and tampered with. Plaintiff’s Counsel pointed out that the serial numbers appearing at pages 12 to 16 on the one hand, and pages 17 to 24 on the other, were repetitive, and further did not correspond to the content page at page 1 of the Risk Assessment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99">99&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plaintiff further contended that the Plaintiff’s instructed task was not included in the Risk Assessment<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a>. Neither DW2 or DW3 were able to highlight any specific parts of the Risk Assessment that specified the Plaintiff’s instructed works.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100">100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I agree with the Plaintiff that without a credible explanation from the Defendant as to the discrepancies in the Risk Assessment, an adverse inference ought to be drawn against the Defendant that there was not in place a sufficient Risk Assessment at the material time: see <em>Miah Rasel</em>.</a></p><a id="p1_100"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Safety Work Procedures </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a><a id="p1_101">101&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff noted that the Defendant had exhibited a Safety Work Procedure at DB50-70. The procedures relating to the Plaintiff’s work on the scaffold is found at DB54-56.</a></p><a id="p1_101"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a><a id="p1_102">102&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff submitted that the scaffold was not certified for use by the Plaintiff at the material time as the Certificate of Supervision provided by the Plaintiff (DB8) had expired in December 2019, and there was accordingly no certificate at the material time of the Accident.</a></p><a id="p1_102"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a><a id="p1_103">103&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, under the Safety Work Procedure, the Defendant was required to ensure that there must be sufficient supervision of the Plaintiff by a competent supervisor at the material time. It was undisputed that the Plaintiff was working alone and not under any supervision at the material time. In light of the above, Plaintiff submitted that the Defendant did not implement and/or enforce the Safety Work Procedure at the material time. I agree that such supervision was not borne out by the evidence.</a></p><a id="p1_103"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Permit to Work, the Risk Assessment and the Safety Work Procedures and the Plaintiff’s pleaded case</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a><a id="p1_104">104&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the above arguments, I agree with Defendant’s Counsel that once it is accepted that the Plaintiff had slipped or fallen whilst descending the ladder, the Plaintiff’s <em>pleaded case</em> must fail <em>in limine</em>. No alternative case based on slipping or falling from a ladder, or any other scenarios, was pleaded by the Plaintiff. As the Plaintiff’s pleaded case – namely that he fell when he stepped into an unbarricaded opening – had not been proven on a balance of probabilities, all of the Plaintiff’s arguments based on the Permit to Work, Risks Assessments, etc. do not advance the Plaintiff’s case any further as they do not go towards proving a breach of duty of care <em>in relation to the Plaintiff’s pleaded case.</em></a></p><a id="p1_104"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a><a id="p1_105">105&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, there was no link between the alleged breaches of the WSHA and associated regulations and the Plaintiff’s loss. Even if the lack of a Permit to Work, Risk Assessment and Safety Work Procedure were established, they were not shown to be <em>causative</em> of the Plaintiff’s injuries, which I have found, on a balance of probabilities, to be due to accidental slipping while descending the monkey ladder. It was not proven that <em>but for</em> the lack of a Permit to Work, the Risk Assessment and the enforcement of the Safety Work Procedure, the Plaintiff would not have slipped while descending the monkey ladder. More pertinently, the Plaintiff never ran its case based on the accidental slippage while descending the monkey ladder, and consequently did not adduce any evidence to substantiate its claim that the training, supervision and work procedures relating to ascending and/or descending the monkey ladder were deficient or inadequate. As noted in <em>Mookan</em>, the court cannot made a decision on a fact which had not been pleaded.</a></p><a id="p1_105"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a><a id="p1_106">106&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the forgoing reasons, based on the Plaintiff’s pleaded case, I found that the Plaintiff had not proven that the Defendant had breached its duty of care owed to it. The essential ingredients for establishing a claim in negligence had thus not been made out.</a></p><a id="p1_106"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a><a id="p1_107">107&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
