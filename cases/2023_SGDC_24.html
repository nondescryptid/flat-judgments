Despite bail being offered to the Accused, he was remanded on the same day and remained in remand throughout. He was unrepresented for the most part of the proceedings. On 3 February 2022, the matter was sent to the Pre-Trial Conference (“PTC”) Court as the Accused made known that he was disputing the charges.</a></p><a id="p1_8-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_8-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 4 March 2022, the Accused informed the PTC judge that he wished to plead guilty, and that he would not be engaging counsel or applying for legal aid under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (“CLAS”). A plead guilty (“PG”) mention was fixed on 13 April 2022.</a></p><a id="p1_8-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_8-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the first PG mention on 13 April 2022, the Prosecution’s position was to proceed with the enhanced drug consumption charge and two enhanced drug possession charges. However, the Accused disputed the enhanced drug consumption charge. The matter was therefore sent back to the PTC Court.</a></p><a id="p1_8-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_8-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused then applied for legal aid under CLAS but was rejected. He continued to maintain that he did not consume any drugs. On 1 August 2022, at the PTC Court hearing, the Prosecution amended its position and conveyed that it would proceed on the three enhanced drug possession charges stated at [2] above, with the enhanced drug consumption charge and the other enhanced drug possession charge to be TIC, should the Accused choose to plead guilty. The Accused indicated that he would plead guilty.</a></p><a id="p1_8-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_8-p2_e">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the second PG mention on 12 September 2022, the Accused disputed the enhanced drug possession charges which the Prosecution had indicated they would be proceeding on, denying that the drugs found on him belonged to him and also denying knowledge that they were drugs. The matter was thus sent back to the PTC Court again.</a></p><a id="p1_8-p2_e"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_e"></a><a id="p1_8-p2_f">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the PTC Court hearing on 7 October 2022, the Accused disputed all five charges. He claimed that he did not consume any drugs, the drugs found in his possession were items he had picked up whilst working as a cleaner, and that it was always his intention to return the drugs to the police. The PTC Court directed the Prosecution to file the Case for the Prosecution (“CFP”) in accordance with the criminal case disclosure conference (“CCDC”) regime under the Criminal Procedure Code 2010.</a></p><a id="p1_8-p2_f"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_f"></a><a id="p1_8-p2_g">(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 9 November 2022, at a CCDC hearing fixed subsequent to the filing of the CFP, the Accused indicated that having gone through the CFP, he wished to plead guilty to all charges. The matter was therefore fixed for a PG mention for the <em>third</em> time. During the interim period, the Accused applied to CLAS again and a defence counsel was assigned this time.</a></p><a id="p1_8-p2_g"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_g"></a><a id="p1_8-p2_h">(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defence counsel appeared at the third PG mention on 10 January 2023 before me, and sought a short adjournment in order to take full instructions from the Accused.

The mitigation plea stated that the Accused was “genuinely remorseful for his actions” and that he has “pleaded guilty as a sign of remorse”. Defence counsel urged the Court to impose the mandatory minimum sentences, which would add up to a global sentence of four years’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_8-p2_i"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_i"></a><a id="p1_8-p2_j">(j)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 31 January 2023, just prior to the third adjourned PG mention, the Court was informed that the Accused had tendered his own written migration letter. In the written mitigation letter tendered, the Accused stated the following, amongst other things:</a></p><a id="p1_8-p2_j"> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">For one of my current charges, I did had [<em>sic</em>] the intention of surrendering the drugs that were found during the course of my work as a cleaner.

This was in fact what the Accused had claimed during the PTC hearing on 7 October 2022, which led to the PTC Court directing that the CFP be filed.</a></p><a id="p1_8-p2_k"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_k"></a><a id="p1_8-p2_l">(l)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defence counsel then requested to stand down the matter to speak with the Accused. When the hearing resumed, defence counsel stated that it was the Accused’s intention to plead guilty and admit to all the offences without qualification, and that the Accused would like to <em>retract</em> his written mitigation letter.</a></p><a id="p1_8-p2_l"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_l"></a><a id="p1_8-p2_m">(m)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, I sought the Accused’s confirmation that he had indeed knowingly possessed the drugs in question at the material date and time stated in the charges without valid excuse. The Accused confirmed so. Thereafter, I found him guilty and convicted him on the three proceeded charges.</a></p><a id="p1_8-p2_m"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Parties’ Submissions on Sentence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8-p2_m"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution sought the mandatory minimum sentence for each of the proceeded charges. When I explained during the Prosecution’s address on sentence the reasons why, in my view, the mandatory minimum sentence might not be appropriate given the facts of this case, the Prosecution stated that it would have no objection if the Court deemed it fit to impose a higher sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_9"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In mitigation, defence counsel pleaded for me to consider that the Accused only had the benefit of full legal advice and representation recently, and that his actions in the history of the proceedings should be considered in that light. Defence counsel then reiterated that the Accused had taken the time to reflect, and was now genuinely remorseful for his action.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision on Sentence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central issue before the court was whether the mandatory minimum sentence should be imposed for each of the enhanced drug possession charges. On this issue, our courts have laid down the following principles:</a></p><a id="p1_11"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_11-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mandatory minimum sentence should be imposed “where a case displays a remarkable lack of aggravating factors and a number of significant mitigating factors and where the interests of deterrence, rehabilitation or prevention do not mandate otherwise” (<em>Public Prosecutor v Lim Ah Seng</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 2 SLR(R) 0957.xml')">[2007] 2 SLR(R) 957</a> at [82]).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mandatory minimum sentence should be “reserved for offenders who have strong mitigating factors in their favour and where there are no aggravating factors present” (<em>Public Prosecutor v Chua Hock Leong</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21893-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGCA 32</a> at [6]).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In deciding whether to impose the mandatory minimum sentence, the Court should consider whether doing so would “reflect [the accused’s] antecedents and the TIC charges” (<em>Public Prosecutor v Lai Teck Guan</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22608-SSP.xml')">[2018] 5 SLR 852</a> (“<em>Lai Teck Guan</em>”) at [60]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying these principles, it was clear to me that, contrary to parties’ submissions, this was not an appropriate case for the mandatory minimum sentences to be imposed, for the four reasons I set out below.</a></p><a id="p1_12"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, while a plea of guilt is usually treated as an indication of remorse and should be accorded mitigating weight, the Court must be carefully attuned to whether the remorse expressed through the plea is indeed a genuine one. The Court may consider this issue not just with reference to the legal submissions put forth by the Defence in mitigation, but also the accused person’s behaviour or claims made throughout the court proceedings prior to the pronouncement of sentence. It has thus been observed that when an accused person “puts forth a <em>false or misleading account of the events so as to reduce his level of culpability</em> – whether when disputing the statement of facts, or during mitigation …. [this] may suggest that he is lacking in remorse” (Kow Keng Siong, <em>Sentencing Principles in Singapore</em> (Academy Publishing, 2<sup>nd</sup> Ed, 2019) at para 20.179).</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, in light of the history of the proceedings set out at [8] above, I was not able to come to the view that the Accused’s plea of guilt reflected a level of remorse that should be accorded <em>significant</em> mitigating weight. The Accused had not pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, with two earlier PG mentions having to be vacated because of his vacillating positions. He had only agreed to plead guilty <em>after</em> the Prosecution had filed its CFP. Moreover, just before the adjourned third PG mention, in which he already had the benefit of legal advice and representation, the Accused was still trying to downplay his culpability in his written mitigation letter by repeating the same claims he had made in the PTC Court earlier, such that defence counsel had to retract the written mitigation letter before his plea could be taken. When questioned by the Court, the Accused confirmed that he had knowingly possessed the drugs stated in the charges without valid excuse; the implication being that what he had earlier represented to the Court at least twice – first before the PTC Court, and then in his written mitigation letter tendered before the third adjourned PG mention – on how he had come to be in possession of the drugs was simply false.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I considered and gave some weight to the defence counsel’s submission that the Accused was not represented for the large part of the proceedings, which suggests that the Court should be more forgiving towards the Accused’s behaviour in the proceedings. In my view, a distinction should be drawn between an unrepresented accused person who did not plead guilty at the earliest opportunity because he was genuinely unaware or uninformed of whether he had a viable defence, or because he wished to first engage counsel before taking a position, and one who consistently chose to put forth a “false or misleading account” before the Court to downplay his culpability to the extent that it was not legally possible for him to plead guilty. The Accused, in my view, fell into the latter category. Furthermore, he had persisted in his misguided attempt to downplay his culpability <em>even after</em> he had been legally advised and represented by counsel. Considering all of the above, I concluded that the Accused’s eventual plea of guilt should not be accorded the same mitigating weight as compared to offenders who express genuine remorse by admitting to their offences without qualification at the earliest opportunity.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Accused was traced for multiple drug offences. Even though most of his drug offences, including his previous drug possession offence, were dated, he had in the last few years relapsed into consuming drugs, which led to him being sentenced to an LT-1 imprisonment sentence in 2015. This is therefore not a case where there had been a long, clean break between the Accused’s prior drug offence and his fresh drug offences, such that it could be said that the mandatory minimum sentence of a charge involving an enhanced punishment would be commensurate with his culpability.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, there were two <em>similar</em> TIC charges. As the Court of Appeal in <em>Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20745-SSP.xml')">[2017] 2 SLR 449</a> at [64(a)] explained, while a court is not bound to increase a sentence merely because there are TIC offences, it will normally do so where the TIC offences are of a similar nature. In the present case, one of the TIC offences is an enhanced drug consumption offence, which carried a higher mandatory minimum sentence (i.e., 3 years) compared with the proceeded charges. Imposing the mandatory minimum sentence in these circumstances would not, in my view, accurately “reflect [the Accused’s] antecedents and the TIC charges” (<em>Lai Teck Guan</em> at [60]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the extent of the Accused’s disregard for the law and his recalcitrance were demonstrated by the fact that he had committed the offences on 9 September 2021 (in which <em>various</em> types of drug exhibits were found in his residence) even after he had been arrested and investigated for his earlier set of offences on 29 July 2021, where he was released on station bail. Having persisted in committing the same type of offences whilst he was on bail, I was of the view that the imprisonment sentences to be imposed for the offences committed on 9 September 2021 should be pegged higher to accurately reflect the Accused’s increased culpability, based on the principles of specific deterrence and prevention (<em>Loo Pei Xiang Alan v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18099-SSP.xml')">[2015] 5 SLR 500</a> at [29]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of “strong mitigating factors” and given the various aggravating factors highlighted above, I was of the view that an uplift from the mandatory minimum sentence was warranted in all three proceeded charges, and imposed the following individual sentences accordingly:</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_19-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 29 July 2021 offence: 2 years’ and 1 month imprisonment;</a></p><a id="p1_19-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_19-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 9 September 2021 diamorphine offence: 2 years and 2 months’ imprisonment; and</a></p><a id="p1_19-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_19-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 9 September 2021 yellow liquid and packet offence: 2 years and 2 months’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_19-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I decided that the sentences for the 29 July 2021 offence and the 9 September 2021 diamorphine offence should run consecutively, as these were offences occurring on different dates. The total sentence I imposed was therefore 4 years and 3 months’ imprisonment, with effect from 9 December 2021, the date in which the Accused was first remanded.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I was of the view that the aggregate sentence I had imposed on the Accused was just and appropriate, one which was keeping with his culpability, past records, and the level of remorse he had demonstrated by his actions throughout the entirety of the proceedings.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused is currently serving sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a></div></content></html>
