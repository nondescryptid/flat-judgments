Her mother had told her his real name but she could not remember it. Instead, because the Accused would cook food occasionally and served her vegetables, she had nicknamed him “Uncle Veggie”.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Circumstances leading to the police report</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V became friends with a schoolmate, PW7, when they were in Primary 3 in 2018. They would play regularly together after school almost every other day at the playground near their school. At times, PW7 would play with V in her mother’s flat on V’s invitation. On these occasions PW7 had seen the Accused at this flat a few times. She understood that the Accused was living with V’s mother. She had asked V about the Accused and V had referred to him as “Uncle Veggie”.</a></p><a id="p1_11"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 25 January 2019, when they were in Primary 4, PW7 and V were playing as usual after school in the playground, V suddenly told her something troubling. V informed PW7 that she had been nearly ‘touched’ by Uncle Veggie at her mother’s flat. PW7 then called the police as she was worried and scared for her friend. Her ‘999’ call was captured in the First Information Report (exhibit P1) as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_12"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">My friend [V] nearly got sex by an older guy by the name of Uncle Vegy. Uncle Vegy lives with her mother. This happen when she was primary 2. She is staying at [address] level 8. She just playing with us now.

After meeting up with V and PW7, the police brought them back to the police station. Subsequently, the police called V’s father to inform him that his daughter was at the police station and to come and fetch his daughter. At the station, the police informed him of the allegation of his daughter being molested by the Accused. He was told to bring V to the hospital for a medical examination. He did so and was informed that there was no sexual penetration of V.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 3 incidents of alleged molest</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V testified through a video-link and was accompanied by a volunteer with Singapore Children’s Society during her testimony.

After he had massaged her shoulders, he turned her around and then pulled her legs “towards his private part”. When he did that, her private part came into contact with his private part. She moved back but the Accused pulled her towards him again and he did this three times, each time her private part had come into contact with his private part<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, she got out from the couch and went into her mother’s bedroom. At that time her mother was gambling with her friends in another room, which was closed. She went into the room as she did not know what to think, how to react or what to say when the incident happened<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a>. She then continued to watch her videos on her handphone in the room. After a while, the Accused called her name. She did not know what to do so she came out of the room and saw the Accused in the living room. The Accused asked her to bend down. She complied by bending over at 90 degrees. She then felt his private part on the top of her head<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. She did not know how to respond and instead, she quickly went towards the door to put on her shoes.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she was putting on her shoes, the Accused was behind her. She then felt his private part on her “back part”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a>.

These attempts had been captured on a series of WhatsApp text and audio messages.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first inkling that there was some unhappiness expressed by V towards the Accused came in the WhatsApp messages that had been extracted forensically by the police of V’s handphone (Annex A of exhibit P5). It is set out at serial no. 4484 with the date stated as 17 June 2018. It reads (“<b>the 1st message</b>”)</a></p><a id="p1_20"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">I hate you. I hate you!!!!

A few messages later, V said (at serial no 4497) “But I still don’t want to see your Boyfriend”, to which V’s mother had asked “What he did to you?” and V had replied “Nothing, but I hate him. Ok”.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Court, V was asked why she had sent these messages to her mother. V’s reply was that she could not remember why she had sent these messages. She also could not remember whether these messages were before or after the alleged incidents. However she went on to explain that her relationship with the Accused was alright even though initially she was overprotective of her mother. She then tried to get to know him better by talking to him but as he spoke Chinese, she did not really talk much with him. Over time, her relationship progressed as she would try to talk to him and he would reply by speaking a little bit of English. She would normally say ‘Hi’ to him and thereafter proceeded to do her own things<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However for the next relevant set of messages sent out, she could remember the reason.

The recording was played and the transcript reads (“<b>the 2<sup>nd</sup> message</b>”)</a></p><a id="p1_23"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Hate 'Uncle Vegy', here is why.

She was worried for her mother as she was afraid that the Accused might do the same thing to her as what had transpired earlier between the Accused and V.

After about 5 minutes, he asked her if she was experiencing pain anywhere else and V pointed to her calf.</a></p><a id="p1_43"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a><a id="p1_44">44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused asked her to put her legs on another chair but V said she was uncomfortable as she wanted to play her games on her phone.

After that he then moved on to massage the back of the calves. After he had done that, the Accused said he could not reach one part of her legs and therefore asked V to flip over to face upwards. The Accused then proceeded to massage her shin area by pressing moving his fingers around the side of the shin bone areas. He also pulled V once towards him by holding her at ankle to pull. The purpose was to loosen her tendons<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46">46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused stated that he was standing behind the arm rest of the sofa when he pulled V once towards him<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47">47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused confirmed that nothing else happened after the massage.

He also denied ever asking V to bow towards him and thereafter causing his genital area to come into contact with V’s head. Finally, he denied placing his genital area against V’s buttock whilst V was bent down wearing her shoes.</a></p><a id="p1_48"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The reasons why V could have falsely accused him</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a><a id="p1_49">49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused then came up with several reasons why V might have detested him and therefore have falsely accused him.

He thought that he might have caused her some pain in the process. He did ask her if it was painful but she did not reply. He reckoned that V was unhappy because of that<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Accused scolded V and her friends loudly in a harsh tone</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51">51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused recounted that there was one day a neighbour had come to the flat to complain about the noise that V and her friends were making while playing their games and had threatened to call the police.</a></p><a id="p1_51"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a><a id="p1_52">52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused then scolded the children in a loud voice and with a harsh tone to stop making noise. However, the children were so immersed in their games that they did not hear him and continued playing. He then just left them alone and instead went to tell V’s mother, who was playing mahjong with her friends, to them to stop creating a ruckus as he was also having a headache.</a></p><a id="p1_52"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a><a id="p1_53">53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later that night, after the mahjong session, the Accused again complained to V’s mother that V and her friends were very noisy while playing their games and had slammed the door very hard. He asked her to pass the message to V. He again surmised that might have caused V to detest him as she disliked being reprimanded<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">V's friends did not like the Accused and wanted him to leave</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54">54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused recalled that there was one day when he was in the kitchen cooking, V had come up to him to inform him that her friends did not like him and wanted him to leave<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55">55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt bewildered by what V had told him and relayed that to V’s mother.

Coincidentally, V’s friend who was staying next door walked by and he asked her for a favour which was to bring up the food to V’s flat. V’s friend did not agree initially but relented in the end and brought the food up. He reckoned that V’s friend was not happy to do that.

It has also been held that where the only evidence before a court is the testimony of a sole witness, it would be unsafe for a court to convict unless the evidence of the sole witness is so reliable or “unusually compelling”: see <em>Tang Kin Seng v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1996] 3 SLR(R) 0444.xml')">[1996] 3 SLR(R) 444</a>. It was also explained in <em>Teo Keng Poh v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1996] 2 SLR(R) 0890.xml')">[1996] 2 SLR(R) 890</a> at [73], there is nothing magical about the words “unusually convincing” which is just another way of stating that the testimony of the witness was so convincing that the Prosecution’s case was proven beyond a reasonable doubt, solely on the basis of that testimony.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59">59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our present case, all the allegations of outrage of modesty are indeed based on the testimony of a sole witness, namely V. On the other hand, the Defence is essentially a bare denial. Hence, for a conviction to be granted, the evidence must be such that the testimony of V must be found to be unusually convincing or compelling.</a></p><a id="p1_59"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a><a id="p1_60">60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In analysing the evidence of the witnesses, in <em>Farida Begam d/o Mohd Artham v PP</em> [2001] 3 SLR(R) at [9], it was held that a judge can make a finding on the credibility of a witness based on some or all of the following:</a></p><a id="p1_60"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60"></a><a id="p1_60-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His demeanour.</a></p><a id="p1_60-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_60-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The internal consistency (or lack thereof) in the content of his evidence.</a></p><a id="p1_60-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_60-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eternal consistency (or lack thereof) between the content of his evidence and extrinsic evidence (for example, the evidence of other witnesses, documentary evidence or exhibits).</a></p><a id="p1_60-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_61">61&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also bore in mind the words of the Yong Pung How CJ in <em>B v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2003] 1 SLR(R) 0400.xml')">[2003] 1 SLR(R) 400</a> that in a situation where the complainant of sexual abuse is a child, the manner in which the court should treat the evidence of the child witness is no different from that accorded to the evidence of an adult witness in that the court must still be satisfied that the child’s evidence is so reliable or unusually compelling: see [25].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62">62&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, in determining the reliability of the evidence, the court should always</a></p><a id="p1_62"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">assess the evidence in the light of all the circumstances of each case as well as the accumulated knowledge of human behaviour and common sense. Consequently, where the assessment of the overall reliability of the evidence of a child witness is concerned, it is prudent for the court to be mindful that children, depending on their level of intellectual maturity, may occasionally confuse fantasy and reality: see [26].</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a><a id="p1_63">63&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking into consideration and applying the above principles, I now proceed to assess the evidence of V who was 9 years old at the material time and 12 years old when she was testifying in court.</a></p><a id="p1_63"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">THE ANALYSIS OF THE EVIDENCE</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The intellectual and maturity level of V</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a><a id="p1_64">64&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found V coming across as a forthright witness who was able to understand and answer the questions posed to her clearly and consistently save when it came to the more sensitive questions which took her a long time to answer and she had remained silent for long periods of time.</a></p><a id="p1_64"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a><a id="p1_65">65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also had the opportunity to hear her speak to her mother through the audio recording that was played in court. She displayed a very child-like innocence in her manner of speaking which was consistent with her age of 9 years at that time.</a></p><a id="p1_65"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a><a id="p1_66">66&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In court, I could see her doing her best to answer every question and she was able to comprehend the question and answer the questions in a coherent and logical manner. She clearly did not display any tendency to confuse reality with fantasy nor did she try to embellish her evidence. I found her to be clearly a competent witness with a maturity which commensurated with her age.</a></p><a id="p1_66"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The credibility of V’s evidence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">V’s account of the incidents</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a><a id="p1_67">67&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V was able to give a cogent and consistent account of the incidents of outrage of modesty of the three incidents. Her evidence withstood cross-examination although she did have some difficulty answering certain questions. However, I found such difficulty not fatal taking into account her young age. She was evidently distressed when it came to answering questions about her private part making contact with the private part of the Accused. She had remained silent for a considerable time before being able to give the answers and had teared on several occasions. There was one occasion when she did not return to the stand at the end of a short adjournment to allow her to compose herself. The Court was informed by the court volunteer who was with her that she was crying in the toilet and needed more time to continue with her evidence.</a></p><a id="p1_67"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a><a id="p1_68">68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the multiple pauses, V managed to give an account of the alleged incidents. She stood by her account despite lengthy cross-examination that the incident of the massage did happen when she was alone with the Accused in the living room of her mother’s flat while she was on the sofa. Her mother was playing mahjong in a room with her friends with the door closed. Her brother was not with her as he had gone back to their own flat and hence the acts of molest were undertaken without any witnesses.</a></p><a id="p1_68"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a><a id="p1_69">69&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The massage was initiated by the Accused while she was lying on the sofa watching videos on her handphone. It was the Accused who had asked her if she wanted a massage and she agreed to it. After massaging her shoulders, the Accused had flipped her to face upwards. Whilst in this position, he had pulled her towards him at least twice, which caused V’s private part to come into contact with the Accused’s genital area.</a></p><a id="p1_69"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a><a id="p1_70">70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V denied that she had complained of headache or was rubbing her temple in discomfort and also denied that the Accused had massaged her head and neck while she was seated on the chair at the dining table as alleged by the Accused. She also denied that the Accused had asked her mother for permission to massage her as the Accused had proceeded to massage her shoulders once she said yes to him. She disagreed that the Accused had gone to seek her mother’s consent as her mother was in a room playing mahjong with the room door closed.</a></p><a id="p1_70"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a><a id="p1_71">71&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what is significant about her account is that it is corroborated by the Accused’s account in that he had agreed that he did massage V while she was lying down on her front and had subsequently flipped her to face upwards. He had also agreed significantly that he had pulled her towards him by her legs although not to the extent of causing the illicit sexual contact.</a></p><a id="p1_71"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a><a id="p1_72">72&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that this corroboration is very significant as it showed firstly that there was such a massage having taken place on the sofa while V was lying down on her front and secondly there was a flipping over of V’s body to face upwards and a pulling of her legs towards the Accused. It was clearly not something that was made up by V.</a></p><a id="p1_72"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a><a id="p1_73">73&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found the account given by V to be much more convincing that there was an illicit sexual contact made after the pulling of her legs on at least 2 occasions.</a></p><a id="p1_73"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a><a id="p1_74">74&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly I found the reason given by the Accused rather contrived that he had to flip V over in order to massage her shin bone area. Massages are usually done on the muscle areas of the calves and it would be strange to massage the shin bone area.</a></p><a id="p1_74"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a><a id="p1_75">75&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is also no reason why the Accused needed to pull V towards him. If he was able to massage V while she was lying on her front, there is no need to pull her towards him after flipping her over as he was essentially massaging her in the same area. During cross-examination of V, it was put to her that the Accused had pulled her towards him in order to reach another part of her leg or calves to massage<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76">76&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently on the witness stand, the Accused gave a different reason. He stated in court that the reason was to loosen her tendons<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a>. This reason was also inconsistent with an answer he gave previously. This was because when he was asked this same question in his statement to the police (exhibit P10), he gave the reason at A15 that V had told him that her hip joint was in pain and so he had pulled her legs to soothe the tension in that muscle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77">77&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, if it was true that there was no illicit contact after he had pulled her towards him, then that would have been the end of the matter. There would have been absolutely no reason for V to have misunderstood his actions. V would have felt grateful to the Accused for giving her a massage to ease her discomfort.</a></p><a id="p1_77"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a><a id="p1_78">78&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the relationship between them at this stage was good. The Accused has stated that he treated her like a daughter. It was also put to V during cross-examination that the Accused and had cooked regularly, about 3-4 times a month for her, her brother and her mother<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a>. He had also played games with her and her friends.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79">79&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V had also similarly testified that her relationship with the Accused was “ok’ before the incident and that she would say “hello” to him and thereafter do her own things.</a></p><a id="p1_79"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a><a id="p1_80">80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V during her cross-examination had also candidly and spontaneously recalled an incident where the Accused had massaged her head and her mother had taken a photograph of them and had sent it to her or her father<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a>. During re-examination V said that this massage involved the washing of her hair.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81">81&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This matter was subsequently corroborated by the Accused when he was on the witness stand. He testified that one day in April 2018, he and V had washed each other’s hair happily and that V’s mother was present. Both he and V’s mother had taken photograph of the occasion. Exhibits of the photographs (D3-D5) were tendered into court, which had captured the happy moments. In the photographs, I can see V smiling with the Accused with her hands on the Accused’s head in the act of shampooing his hair.</a></p><a id="p1_81"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a><a id="p1_82">82&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution adduced evidence of a chat message between V and her father which was extracted from her phone. This is serial number 2292 in the Annex of the forensic report which contained the WhatsApp messages between the relevant parties.</a></p><a id="p1_82"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a><a id="p1_83">83&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this message, which was sent out on 16 March 2018, V had asked for her father’s permission to go out with the Accused to Jurong Point Mall. The message reads:</a></p><a id="p1_83"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dad can I go Jurong point with Mummy Boyfriend?</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a><a id="p1_84">84&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V stated that this message was sent out prior to the alleged incidents. She was able to reason that she would not have been willing to go out with the Accused after the alleged incidents since what he did was not “a good thing”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85">85&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her being able to address the Accused as her mother’s boyfriend to her father was also indicative of her state of mind, that she appeared to have been able to accept that her mother was in a relationship with the Accused and that she was not hostile to the idea.</a></p><a id="p1_85"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a><a id="p1_86">86&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, V had enjoyed a friendly relationship with the Accused up to the first half of 2018. Therefore it is very strange that V would start sending out messages to her mother warning her about the Accused and attempting to tell her that the Accused had done something bad to her with the first of such messages starting from 17 June 2018. Something must have happened between 16 March 2018 and 17 June 2018.</a></p><a id="p1_86"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The aftermath of the alleged incident and the delay in reporting</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a><a id="p1_87">87&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that following the alleged incidents, V’s behaviour was consistent with a young child who had been molested by someone.</a></p><a id="p1_87"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a><a id="p1_88">88&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First she had expressed shock and confusion and a sense of not knowing what to do. It was understandable that the sense of shock would have caused her to be unable to immediately report the matter to her mother who was also occupied with playing mahjong with her friends. Hence I found it conceivable that she had merely stayed in her mother’s bedroom and played on her handphone until the Accused had called her to come out. I also found it believable that despite what the Accused had earlier done to her, she still complied with the Accused’s request to bend down towards him.</a></p><a id="p1_88"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a><a id="p1_89">89&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that the 6 messages to her mother very poignant and reflected the conflicted thoughts she was undergoing. On one hand, it is evident that she found it hard to say it straight out what the Accused did to her. Hence the 1st message on 17 June 2018 merely stated that she hated the Accused. When asked by her mother what the Accused did to her, V merely replied to say “Nothing, but I hate him. Ok”. In court, V was not able to remember if this message was sent before or after the molest incident.</a></p><a id="p1_89"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a><a id="p1_90">90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, 6 days later, on 23 June 2018, V in the 2<sup>nd</sup> message proceeded to give the reason why she hated the Accused. She started the message with “Hate uncle Vegy. Here is the reason why..” It is quite evident that this was a continuation of the 1<sup>st</sup> message where she stated she hated the Accused but did not want to say why that was so. In this 2<sup>nd</sup> message, she revealed that the Accused had massaged her on the couch and that his private part was at her head. I noted that whilst V did not set out in detail what the Accused did, particularly about pulling her legs towards him until her private part came into contact with his private part, there was some indication of illicit sexual contact.</a></p><a id="p1_90"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a><a id="p1_91">91&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, in the 3<sup>rd</sup> message on 26 June 2018, V expressed her concern for her mother as to whether the Accused would do the same thing to her. She had expressed it as “new boyfriend sex on you”. In the 4<sup>th</sup> message on 24 July 2018, V pleaded with her mum to break up with the Accused as she and her friends hated him.</a></p><a id="p1_91"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a><a id="p1_92">92&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 5<sup>th</sup> message on 17 October 2018, she then disclosed that the Accused had done something bad to her but did not elaborate on it. Instead she again pleaded with her mum not to allow the Accused to stay with her and that he could steal her things and that he could be dangerous. She also expressed in her child-like way that she could stay with her instead.</a></p><a id="p1_92"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a><a id="p1_93">93&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally on 24 January 2019, V then told her mother that the Accused had “sexually abused”. She also said sorry for not telling her as she thought that her mother might hate her for not doing anything.</a></p><a id="p1_93"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a><a id="p1_94">94&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there was also frustration and anger that her mother was not able to understand what she was trying to tell her. Hence, she admitted being angry to the extent of lashing out at her mother with use of vulgarities when she felt that her mother did not understand what she was trying to tell her.</a></p><a id="p1_94"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a><a id="p1_95">95&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found on the whole, her messages to her mother spoke very clearly of the turmoil that was brewing in her and were not concocted to frame the Accused in order to get him out of her mother’s life. If that was the case, V could have easily sounded up her mother or informed her father and her aunt when they asked her about the 5<sup>th</sup> message. Instead she chose to keep mum about it.</a></p><a id="p1_95"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a><a id="p1_96">96&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also found that V was far from being a vindictive child, and instead was very conflicted about the making of a police report. She finally told her friend at a playground more than half a year later because she felt a lot of emotional pain trying to keep it a secret and decided to make a report. Even then, she had to make her friend promise to call the police before revealing it to her.</a></p><a id="p1_96"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a><a id="p1_97">97&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I set out here her replies as to why she managed to tell her friend PW7 about the incident:</a></p><a id="p1_97"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And can you tell us why you decided to tell [PW7] about the incident at that point?</p> </a><p class="Judg-Quote-1"><a id="p1_97">A Because I couldn’t keep it anymore and that it hurts me inside whenever I like---whenever I can’t tell---say to people about the incident because I was scared, and I was not ready to say it<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…..</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S---so, why did you know that you have to tell [PW7] even though you felt that you’re not ready to tell?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A Well, because I couldn’t really hold the secret anymore and then it was hurting me inside.

She proffered this reason based on an animation she had watched which had depicted a scenario where a victim was afraid that she would be scolded by her parents for not telling them immediately after the incident. Whilst V was not able to say when she had watched this video, there is no reason to doubt that such a fear could easily operate on a child’s mind. This was also a reason she had set out at paragraph 6 in D2 where she stated that “I ever watched an online video about parents scolding children who report about molest case. I was scare.”</a></p><a id="p1_99"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The frequency of V’s visits dropped in the second half of 2018</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a><a id="p1_100">100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pertinent that the Defence did not challenge the evidence of V’s father that the frequency of V’s visit to her mother’s flat had dropped in the later part of 2018. During his cross-examination, the Defence Counsel asserted that it was the Accused’s case that her frequency was once a week, on a Friday, to which V’s father had agreed and thereafter the Defence Counsel had confirmed with V’s father that his evidence was that the frequency had thereafter dropped in the later part of 2018 without challenging that it was untrue.</a></p><a id="p1_100"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a><a id="p1_101">101&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V herself had testified that after the alleged incidents, she seldom spoke with the Accused and she started avoiding him, by ensuring that she would quickly finish her meal at her mother’s flat before the Accused came home.</a></p><a id="p1_101"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a><a id="p1_102">102&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on the stand, the Accused took the position that there was no drop in frequency in terms of V’s visits in 2018 and had remained the same throughout.</a></p><a id="p1_102"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a><a id="p1_103">103&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found this position to be untenable given that he had failed to challenge V’s father on this point. I found that drop in frequency also coincided with the messages that V was sending to his mother indicating strongly her dislike for the Accused from the middle of 2018 onwards. This drop in frequency is consistent with V’s evidence that something adverse had happened between the Accused and her sometime before the middle of 2018.</a></p><a id="p1_103"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a><a id="p1_104">104&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the attack on V’s credibility due to the inconsistencies in her evidence.</a></p><a id="p1_104"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The inconsistencies in V’s evidence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a><a id="p1_105">105&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were a lot of materials to test V’s evidence. V had given 2 police statements which had been admitted into evidence following an impeachment exercise carried out by the Defence Counsel. V’s account of the incident was also captured in the Child Guidance Clinic report (exhibit P9). V was also referred for examination at the KK Women and Children’s Hospital and was seen by Dr Charissa Goh (PW3) of the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department. PW7 had also testified as to what V had told her about the incident prior to making the police report. Finally, V’s aunt, PW also testified about what V had told her after the police report has been lodged.</a></p><a id="p1_105"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a><a id="p1_106">106&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In assessing the materiality of the inconsistencies, I bore in mind that V was only 9 years old at the material time of the incident. By the time the matter was reported, it was more than half a year later. By the time she came to court, it was almost 3 years from the incident. Even for an adult witness, it would be difficult to remember the details of any event and very likely there will be some distortions in the memory of the event. Hence, all the more so, it would be extremely challenging for a child of tender age to remember all the details of a past traumatic incident.</a></p><a id="p1_106"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Inconsistency in what was told to PW7</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a><a id="p1_107">107&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first inconsistency I noted was the words used by PW7 on what had been told to her by V as set out in her police report. In the police report, PW7 had used the words “nearly got sex by an older guy”. In court, PW7 had stated that V had told her that she nearly touched. V had denied using any of these words to PW7. Instead V stated that she had told PW7 that the Accused had raped her. However she was unable to say how she learned of the word or why she had used it.</a></p><a id="p1_107"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a><a id="p1_108">108&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also noted that PW7 had reported the incident as having happened when V was in Primary 2, which would have been in the year 2017.</a></p><a id="p1_108"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a><a id="p1_109">109&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found such inconsistencies immaterial. It would be quite difficult to remember the exact words or phrases used by V that were spoken more than 2 years ago. What is more significant is that the words in the report “nearly got sex by an older guy” did capture the alleged act of the Accused of causing her private part to come into contact with his private part in a very broad sense. With regard to the time of the incident, it is not surprising that to a child, time could have passed much faster and the incident could have appeared much longer than what it is. In any case, it is not disputed by the Accused that he did massage V in the year of 2018, hence any error in V’s memory as to when the incident had happened would be immaterial.</a></p><a id="p1_109"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Inconsistency on whether the incidents happened on one or two days.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a><a id="p1_110">110&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Goh testified that she saw V on 30 January 2019. She took down notes of the account of the sexual offence, given by V to her. She stated that V had mentioned that there was an incident when she was on the sofa that the Accused had asked to give her a massage. After massaging her back, the Accused had turned her around and pulled her legs such that her groin came into contact with his groin. V then went to her mother’s room to look for her but her mother was busy playing mahjong with her friends. V also recounted another incident where the Accused had asked her to bend forward and thereafter the Accused had pressed her head onto his groin. Dr Goh testified that this incident had allegedly taken place on a different day.</a></p><a id="p1_110"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a><a id="p1_111">111&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defence Counsel had highlighted that V had given an inconsistent account in terms of the room she had gone into. In this account to Dr Goh, she appeared to have stated that the room she went into was the room where her mother was playing mahjong but in court, her testimony was that she went into her mother’s bedroom which was empty at that time while her mother was playing mahjong with her friends in another room. I found this discrepancy insignificant. V might not have been very precise or clear that it was a different room and Dr Goh could have therefore understood it to be referring to the same room.</a></p><a id="p1_111"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a><a id="p1_112">112&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also noted that the age of V as recounted to Dr Goh was 8 years old but it has been established that V would have been 9 years old. This point about inaccuracy of the age has been addressed as being immaterial given the lapse of time.</a></p><a id="p1_112"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a><a id="p1_113">113&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more significant would be that the incident of the contact between V’s head and the Accused’s groin was stated to be on a different day compared to V’s account in court which was that it had happened on the same day following the massage incident. At this juncture, I note that V had stated that there were two different massage incidents which happened on two different days in her first police statement (exhibit D1) given on 25 January 2019.</a></p><a id="p1_113"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a><a id="p1_114">114&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In D1, she recounted 2 incidents of the Accused pulling both her legs towards him such that she could feel his private part. She stated that after the first time, on the next day, it happened again. During this second incident, when she got up to leave the flat, while she was wearing her shoes in a standing position, she felt the Accused’s private part on her buttock area.</a></p><a id="p1_114"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a><a id="p1_115">115&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also noted that PW11 after asking V on 29 January 2019, had the impression from V that the incident in relation to the contact with her buttock happened on a separate day from the earlier massage incident.</a></p><a id="p1_115"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a><a id="p1_116">116&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore noted three differences in her account:</a></p><a id="p1_116"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_116"></a><a id="p1_116-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Massage which involved pulling of legs towards the Accused resulting in touching of his groin took place on 2 occasions over 2 days, according to D1. In her account as recorded by Dr Goh, there was only one occasion when the Accused pulled V towards him during a massage.</a></p><a id="p1_116-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_116-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_116-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bending down resulting in her head coming into contact with the Accused’s private part took place on the second day according to Dr Goh’s notes. This incident was not mentioned in D1.</a></p><a id="p1_116-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_116-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_116-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contact between V’s buttock and the Accused’s private part was only mentioned in D1 and it took place on the second day. This was also the impression given to PW11. It was not mentioned in Dr Goh’s notes. In court, V’s evidence is both these incidents happened on the same day as the massage and they all happened on one day and not over two days.</a></p><a id="p1_116-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_117">117&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is not the end of the matter. In a subsequent police statement dated 4 January 2020 (exhibit D2), V clarified that the incident of the massage took place on only one day and that the Accused had pulled her twice toward him and after coming into contact with his private part for two times, V went to her mother’s room to tell her that she wanted to go home. However, when she left her mother’s room, the Accused had asked her to bend down. She bowed down and she felt the Accused’s private part touching the top of her head. She then got away from him and went to wear her shoes. The Accused came and used his private part to touch her buttocks.</a></p><a id="p1_117"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a><a id="p1_118">118&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In D2, V had explained that she had since the first statement tried to “think back” and she remembered that it was on the same day that the Accused had pulled her legs and made his private part touch her private part two times.</a></p><a id="p1_118"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a><a id="p1_119">119&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Court when confronted with all these discrepancies, V had difficulty articulating her response. Nonetheless she stood by the evidence she had given in court.</a></p><a id="p1_119"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a><a id="p1_120">120&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first brush, it is of concern that V was not able to keep a consistent account on the number of times that the Accused had pulled her towards him resulting in physical contact between their private parts and whether this happened over one or two days. However, on a closer look, I found that this was more of an issue with her memory of the details rather than a concoction of the incident.</a></p><a id="p1_120"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a><a id="p1_121">121&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, there does not appear to be any reason why V would want to change her evidence to put everything together as one day rather than over 2 days. There is nothing inherently weak about this evidence such that it needed correction or beefing up. It is just as conceivable that the Accused could have committed the acts two days in a row. There is no suggestion or evidence to infer that V had been influenced to change her evidence. I see no reason why V would want to correct her statement other than the fact that it was really because she realised she had made a mistake in her earlier evidence and hence wished to set it right.</a></p><a id="p1_121"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a><a id="p1_122">122&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, even though the quality of the evidence in relation to the massage incident may have been affected by the change in her account from 2 days to one day, I found the evidence still to be sufficiently strong as it is corroborated by the fact of the Accused’s admission that he did massage V on the couch on one occasion with many similar details, save for the physical contact with his private part.</a></p><a id="p1_122"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a><a id="p1_123">123&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for whether the Accused had pulled V towards him two times or three times, as this is a matter of the accuracy of V’s memory, it would be safer to rely on the evidence in her statement since that was given nearer to the time of the incident. The prosecution appears to have taken the same position and did not see fit to amend the charge which had been framed as two times.</a></p><a id="p1_123"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a><a id="p1_124">124&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note further that even before V’s second police statement on 4 January 2020 to clarify her earlier statement, her account that all the three alleged incidents happened on the same day had surfaced on 8 April 2019. This account was given to Dr Bernardine Woo who saw her on that day and this account was duly set out in her Child Guidance Clinic report (P9) at [4]-[5]. Thereafter in court, V had remained steadfast on this position and did not vacillate from this. Thus V was not a witness who was being flippant or careless in her testimony but she came across as trying to piece together an account to accurately reflect what had happened to her.</a></p><a id="p1_124"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The physical improbability of the allegations</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a><a id="p1_125">125&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused also raised 2 points on why he could not have molested V in the manner described by V. First was in relation to position of the Accused being seated on the couch. The Defence had argued that in that position, it would have been improbable for the Accused to be able to execute the act of pulling V’s legs towards him such that their private parts made contact. However, the short answer is that V had merely stated that when she was turned around, she saw the Accused seated on the couch. She did not say that the Accused continued to remain seated on the couch when he pulled her legs towards him. In any case the Accused has stated that he was standing when he pulled V towards him and in that position, there would have been no difficulty of him executing the act in such a way as to cause physical contact between V’s private and his.</a></p><a id="p1_125"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a><a id="p1_126">126&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another physical improbability raised by the Defence was in relation to the Accused’s private part making contact with V’s buttock when V was wearing her shoes. The Defence argued that due to the difference in height between them, it would have been physically impossible.</a></p><a id="p1_126"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a><a id="p1_127">127&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the difference in height was not brought into evidence, even if that is established, I agree with the Prosecution that if the Accused had wanted to press his private part against V’s buttock, he could easily have done so by lowering himself to position himself to allow such contact to be made.</a></p><a id="p1_127"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">V’s possible motives for making false accusation</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a><a id="p1_128">128&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move to the Defence’s contention of why V would be motivated to concoct an allegation to get him out of V’s mother’s life. I had earlier set them out above and will now address the soundness of these contentions.</a></p><a id="p1_128"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a><a id="p1_129">129&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found the contention that V had been motivated by anger towards the Accused due to him hurting her by carrying her from her back ludicrous. First, even if she had felt pain as a result of that, she would have realised that it was in the process of the Accused playing with her. Given that the Accused would even join V and her friends for a time of fun and games, it is far-fetched that a child of 9 years old would turn around to bite an adult who was playing with her with such a venomous accusation. In any case, it was never put or suggested to V when she was on the stand that she was hurt by the Accused’s rough play with her which had caused her to be angry with him</a></p><a id="p1_129"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a><a id="p1_130">130&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the next possible reason proffered by the Accused, it was in relation to the Accused scolding V and her friends harshly and in a loud voice after they had created a ruckus playing games.</a></p><a id="p1_130"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a><a id="p1_131">131&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found this contention similarly to be highly improbable. It beggared belief that a child would go on to wage such a vendetta with false accusation for 6 months culminating into lodging of a police report over a very normal event of being scolded by an adult. In any case, none of the friends as well as V had admitted to such an episode. This contention also lacked conviction as the Accused himself testified that the children might not have heard him as they were so engrossed in their game and continued to play after his scolding. This showed either that they did not hear him or if they did, they were not affected by his scolding.</a></p><a id="p1_131"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a><a id="p1_132">132&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His next contention was that there was one day when V came to tell him that her friends did not like him and that V was easily manipulated by her friends. I similarly found this contention absurd that V would be manipulated by her friends to the extent of mounting a false allegation of a sensitive nature against him.</a></p><a id="p1_132"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a><a id="p1_133">133&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused’s next contention can be given short shrift. He claimed that he had asked one V’s friends who was living next door to bring up food to V but the friend had only done so reluctantly. It defied logic as to how such an event could result in V being upset with the Accused. Firstly, the Accused was providing food for V. Secondly, if at all V’s friend was unhappy with the request made by the Accused, that unhappiness would be unlikely to affect V to such an extent.</a></p><a id="p1_133"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a><a id="p1_134">134&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final reason proffered by the Accused might be the strongest, which is that V was unhappy with the Accused as her mother did not spend sufficient time with her. There is some support for this contention given that the messages sent by V to her mother did allude to this, particularly the 1<sup>st</sup> message which stated that V hated her mother for all she cared about was playing and that she did not even want to pick up her little girl.</a></p><a id="p1_134"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a><a id="p1_135">135&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reason suggested by the Accused is clearly plausible. It is clearly conceivable that a child might feel neglected by the entrance of a new party to her mother’s life which might lead to the child detesting the new party. When confronted with this reason, V had difficulty answering the question and said in the end that she did not know how to answer the question.</a></p><a id="p1_135"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a><a id="p1_136">136&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that her inability to answer the question should not be held against her given her young age. Whilst it would be difficult to understand her thought process since she did not give an answer, it clearly did not necessarily mean that V would therefore be so angry with the Accused to the extent of mounting a false accusation against him. The surrounding undisputed facts do not suggest that this was such a case. The Accused was in a fairly stable relationship with V. He cooked for her and played games with her and even enjoyed fun times washing each other’s hair on one occasion. It would appear that he spent more time with her than her mother who would regularly play mahjong with her friends.</a></p><a id="p1_136"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a><a id="p1_137">137&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the Accused whilst coming up with this plausible reason, was unable to beef it up with any concrete evidence to show why this is more just conjecture on his part. When pressed during cross-examination on why V would be angry that her mother did not spend enough time with her, all he could proffer was that while on a trip to Snow City, he had taken the slide with V’s mother. However, he also stated that V had gone with them with a group of her friends<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a>. I fail to see how this could lead to V being so unhappy with the Accused. After all, they were on a fun outing together and she was indeed spending time together with her mother, albeit not exclusively. However, on the other hand, she also had her friends with her and therefore would not have felt left out just because the Accused went on the slide ride with her mother. At the end of the day, it would appear to be just speculation on the Accused’s part.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Assessment of the credibility of the Accused </p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Lack of consistency in Accused’s statement P10</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138">138&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found in general, the Accused was lacking in credibility particularly in the manner in which he gave his answers to the police as recorded in his statement (exhibit P10).</a></p><a id="p1_138"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a><a id="p1_139">139&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was first asked for his response to the allegation that he had touched V inappropriately, his answer is set out at A5:</a></p><a id="p1_139"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Nothing of that sort happened. I never play with her before and [V]’s temper is really bad. I will try not to interact with her. I did not understand what [V] referring to when she says I touched her.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a><a id="p1_140">140&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was pointed out to him that this was inconsistent with his evidence in court where he had given multiple examples of interacting with V, he then gave the excuse that he was working and was under a lot of pressure and stress. He also stated that he was feeling anxious whilst he was at the police station.</a></p><a id="p1_140"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a><a id="p1_141">141&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept that the Accused might have been anxious and in a state of shock upon being confronted with such a serious allegation. However, that does not explain the piecemeal manner in which he was prepared to agree on the level of interaction he had with V. From an initial complete denial he went on to concede greater and greater interaction when told of the information received by the police. I set out here the pattern of his answers:</a></p><a id="p1_141"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q6:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police received information that sometime 2 to 3 years ago, you have performed massage on [V] on the living room couch. What do you have to say?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A6:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was once, I did help her to massage. She told me that she was tired and her shoulder was sore. I helped to massage her right neck area. During massage, I did notice something on her right neck, maybe a growth and I told [V’s mother] about this. [V’s mother] was around when I massage [V]. Other than the neck, I never touched her anywhere. That was the only time I massage her.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">….</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q7:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who else was in the house when you performed the massage?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A7:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her brother was there but he was playing his handphone at the living room sofa. The massage happened in the living room where Rachel sat on a chair. The brother did not really bother as he was engross with his handphone.</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-1">….</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q10:&nbsp;&nbsp;Police received information that the massage took place while Rachel lying face down on the living room sofa. What do you have to say?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A10:&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially she was seated on a chair. Because she asked to play on her handphone, she was the one who asked to relocated at the sofa. She was seating down and she was never lying down.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">……</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q12:&nbsp;&nbsp;Police received information that after the massage, you[ turned her around and thereafter pulled both of her legs pulled towards you and due to that, your private part in contact with her private part. What do you have to say?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A12:&nbsp;&nbsp;She did lay down on the sofa during the massage. I did flip her over to face upwards and after that I did pulled both of her legs but her legs were clamp together.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q13:&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did you do that?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A13:&nbsp;&nbsp;When I massage the neck area, I asked her how about the legs. She told me that she is also feeling tired on her legs and before that I did ask her whether she wants me to massage her legs and she agreed. I am very sure that none of her body parts in contact with my private part.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a><a id="p1_142">142&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused had initially stated that he had only massaged V on the neck and not anywhere else. He also stated that V was seated on a chair during this massage.</a></p><a id="p1_142"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a><a id="p1_143">143&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then when the Accused was told that information has been received that V had received the massage while lying face down on the sofa, his answer changed to that V was initially seated on a chair before moving to the sofa and that while on the sofa, she was sitting and not lying down.</a></p><a id="p1_143"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a><a id="p1_144">144&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then shifted his answer from sitting on the sofa to lying down and that he did flip over to face upwards and he did pull her legs. Finally, he also conceded that he had massaged V more than just her neck because he had asked her about her legs and V had told him that she felt her legs were tired.</a></p><a id="p1_144"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a><a id="p1_145">145&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused had clearly been less then truthful about the extent of her the physical contact he had with V and only admitted to more facts when confronted with an assertion by the police that certain information has been received. He clearly tried to distance himself from having massaged V while she was lying on the couch until he felt compelled to reveal more.</a></p><a id="p1_145"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Inconsistent position taken on the location of the massage</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a><a id="p1_146">146&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also brought to my attention that the Accused had taken an inconsistent position on the location of the massage in the Case for the Defence. At [17-18], it was stated that the Accused had first massaged V on her head and neck whilst she was seated on a chair. After that, V had put both her legs on an adjacent dining chair for the Accused to massage her calves. Specifically, the Accused did not mention any massage taking place on the couch with V lying down on it.</a></p><a id="p1_146"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a><a id="p1_147">147&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in court, the Accused changed his position to say that the massage on the chair was done on her head and neck but the massage of the calves took place on the sofa. When this difference was pointed out to the Accused and he was asked to explain the difference, the Accused merely repeated his evidence in court that the massage took place both on the chair and on the sofa. When he was asked to clarify whether there was any massage of the calves on the chair, he then said that massage of the calves took place both on the chair and on the sofa, contrary to his earlier evidence that massage of the calves took place only on the sofa.</a></p><a id="p1_147"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a><a id="p1_148">148&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused clearly could not maintain his evidence consistently on this issue.</a></p><a id="p1_148"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Inconsistency on his evidence as to the presence of V’s brother</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a><a id="p1_149">149&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In P10, when asked whether there was anyone else in the house when the Accused was performing the massage, the Accused replied that while V was being massaged on the chair, V’s brother was playing on his handphone on the sofa. He also stated that V’s brother was engrossed on his handphone. He then stated that when V relocated to the sofa for the massage to be continued, V’s brother remained at the sofa: see [Q11 and A11].</a></p><a id="p1_149"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a><a id="p1_150">150&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Case for the Defence, the Accused took a similar position. At [20], it was stated that throughout the time of the massage, V’s brother was seated nearby on the sofa.</a></p><a id="p1_150"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a><a id="p1_151">151&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly in court, during cross-examination of V, it was put to her that her brother was present during the massage<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a>, to which V denied. When V’s brother was on the stand, he had testified that he had never seen the Accused giving V a massage. It was never suggested or put to him that he might have failed to notice that because he was engrossed with his game on his handphone.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152">152&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when the Accused was on the stand, he took a different position during examination in chief. He claimed instead that V’s brother had started eating first but stopped after a few mouthfuls and went over to the sofa. He was playing games on the sofa while the Accused and V continued to eat at the table. He called V’s brother to join them at the table but he did not listen to him. Instead, V’s brother thereafter stood up and left the house. The Accused then moved on to talk about him massaging V after noticing that V was feeling uncomfortable and was having a headache<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a>. Hence his evidence appeared at this stage was that V’s brother had left the house when he started to massage V.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153">153&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this difference was pointed out to him and he was called upon to give an explanation, the Accused took a long time to formulate his answer. His explanation was a non-committal answer where he merely stated that after dinner V’s brother had sat there and played with his handphone without explaining why his answer in court was different from the earlier position taken by him. When the DPP asked him for his final position as to whether the Accused was present when the massage was given, the Accused after one minute of silence said, “ He was there”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154">154&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused had flip-flopped on his evidence. His initial position appeared to be that V’s brother was present, even at the stage when V was being cross-examined. However, for reasons best known to him, the Accused decided to change his position to the narrative that V’s brother left the house before the massage started. Then when confronted with the glaring different positions and unable to explain himself, the Accused reverted to the original position that V’s brother was present.</a></p><a id="p1_154"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a><a id="p1_155">155&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence of V’s brother is a material issue. If he was indeed present, it would shake the credibility of V’s account as it would be very unlikely for the Accused to dare to commit such a blatant offence in front of V’s brother. It may be that the Accused after hearing V’s brother’s evidence that he had not witnessed any massage that he decided to change tack when he was on the stand to bring his account closer to V’s brother’s evidence and when it was not working out for him, he then decided to go back to his original position. Such shifting of his evidence showed that the Accused is not averse to changing his evidence to suit his case.</a></p><a id="p1_155"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Inconsistency as to whether he had sought consent of V’s mother to give V a massage</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a><a id="p1_156">156&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In court, the Accused had testified that he had obtained V’s mother’s consent before giving V a massage on her head and neck. I can see that this contention is being made in an attempt to show that this massage was done above board. However, this was only raised for the first time in court.</a></p><a id="p1_156"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a><a id="p1_157">157&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused had many opportunities to cite this fact in his favour. In P10, at A9, the Accused merely stated that he had told V’s mother about the massage. He did not mention that he had sought her consent before carrying out the massage. Neither did he mention this point in the Case for the Defence. This assertion appears to be an after-thought to bolster his case.</a></p><a id="p1_157"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a><a id="p1_158">158&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V’s mother was called upon to be a defence witness (DW2). She attempted to corroborate the Accused’s evidence by stating that the Accused did come to her while she was playing mahjong with her friends to say that V had asked for a massage. The Accused appeared to be unhappy about the request and reluctant to accede to it. DW2 instead told him that V was only a child and if he could help, he should do so.</a></p><a id="p1_158"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a><a id="p1_159">159&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found her evidence suspect on this matter. First she did not mention this incident in her police statement. More crucially, her evidence did not square with the Accused’s evidence. In the Accused’s version, he had gone to seek her consent to massage V. In her account, the Accused came to tell her that it was V who had requested for a massage and she had to persuade the Accused to do it. Another huge inconsistency is that based on DW2’s account, her friends’ children were outside playing with V, whilst the Accused had testified the only person outside with them was V’s brother.</a></p><a id="p1_159"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a><a id="p1_160">160&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even more fundamentally, this evidence really did not advance the Defence case. Just because the Accused had sought permission or if DW2 had requested him to do it, it is only a neutral fact. This is because V’s mother was in the room playing mahjong and was not present in the living room and thus she would be oblivious to what was happening outside the room. The Accused could very well have obtained DW2’s consent and still commit the offence.</a></p><a id="p1_160"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Accused’s lie about who took the photographs D3 and D4 </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a><a id="p1_161">161&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence tendered 3 photographs of the Accused standing next to the couch in the living room to show his relative position to the couch during the massage on the couch. He identified the 2<sup>nd</sup> photograph showing him standing behind the armrest of the couch as the position he was in when he pulled V towards him. He volunteered that he took these photographs initially<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162">162&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when he was asked subsequently when the photographs were taken and who took those photographs, he strangely went quiet and did not answer for some time. He only answered finally that he could not remember and when pressed again he said that he believed it was him using a self- timer camera on his handphone. He also said that the photographs were taken in 2021.</a></p><a id="p1_162"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a><a id="p1_163">163&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During cross-examination, he was asked how he took the photographs. He claimed that he had placed his handphone on the seat of dining chain. He said he had placed something behind the phone to support it.</a></p><a id="p1_163"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a><a id="p1_164">164&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was then put to the Accused that the handphone has to be placed higher than the backrest of the sofa since the photographs taken were able to show the top of the backrest. This question was repeated four times to the Accused and each time he said he did not understand the question<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165">165&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that the Accused was being deliberately evasive by claiming he did not understand the question so as to avoid answering it. This was because he knew that logically the answer must be yes but that would mean that he could not have taken the photograph by placing his camera on the seat of a dining chair which would be patently lower in height than the top of the backrest of the sofa.</a></p><a id="p1_165"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a><a id="p1_166">166&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was suggested to the Accused had lied to hide the fact that DW2 had assisted in taking the photographs for him. This was because by the year 2021, the Accused had supposedly broken off relations with DW2 and was not supposed to be seeing her as that was a condition of the bail.</a></p><a id="p1_166"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a><a id="p1_167">167&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that there is some truth in this suggestion as the Accused had clearly lied on this issue and the reason suggested by Prosecution was highly plausible. Although this lie did not go directly towards the commission of the offence, it did show once again the Accused is not averse to lying in court when it served his interest to do so.</a></p><a id="p1_167"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a><a id="p1_168">168&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I found that the Accused is not a creditworthy witness.</a></p><a id="p1_168"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">CONCLUSION OF THE VERDICT IN RESPECT OF THE 1<sup>ST</sup> CHARGE DAC-907863-2020</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a><a id="p1_169">169&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, even though there were some inconsistencies in the evidence of V, I found those to be within an acceptable range due to the human frailty of memory and the immaturity of a young child’s mind whose thought processes and capabilities are still in the early stage of development.</a></p><a id="p1_169"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a><a id="p1_170">170&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, V’s description of the offending act which involved the flipping over of V’s body and the pulling of her legs towards the Accused had been corroborated by the Accused’s account.</a></p><a id="p1_170"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a><a id="p1_171">171&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that there was a ring of truth in V’s testimony when all the surrounding circumstances are taken into consideration including the messages sent by V to her mother.</a></p><a id="p1_171"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a><a id="p1_172">172&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, the Accused’s testimony has been filled with inconsistencies on various matters and the Accused had flip-flopped repeatedly on the stand. He also came across as deliberately evasive.</a></p><a id="p1_172"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a><a id="p1_173">173&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I found that on the first charge, V had given an unusually convincing evidence and it has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. I accordingly found the Accused guilty and convicted of this charge DAC-907863-2020.</a></p><a id="p1_173"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">CONCLUSION OF THE CHARGES DAC 907864-2020 AND DAC 907865-2020</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a><a id="p1_174">174&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the remaining 2 charges, I found that V’s credibility just as strong on the evidence given in support of these 2 charges. She had alluded to the Accused’s private part on her head in the 2<sup>nd</sup> message to her mother. On the whole I found that she genuinely believed that what she felt on her head as well as on her buttock was the private part of the Accused.</a></p><a id="p1_174"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a><a id="p1_175">175&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I found that for these 2 acts, unlike the first charge which act took place with V facing the Accused, V was not in a position to see with certainty which part of the Accused’s body she had come into contact with. For one charge, she had bowed down at 90 degrees towards the Accused. As such her eyes would be looking directly at the floor. For the other charge, her back would be facing the Accused.</a></p><a id="p1_175"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a><a id="p1_176">176&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In both instances, she could only feel with the top of her head and the back of her buttocks. In such a situation, whilst V might have believed the contact was with the private part of the Accused given what had transpired moments earlier, the basis of her belief was not elaborated upon during examination in chief and neither was it tested during cross-examination.</a></p><a id="p1_176"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a><a id="p1_177">177&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that it was bare assertion on the part of V that she had come into contact with the Accused’s private part without any further explanation. Given her lack of direct vision, I am of the view much more is needed than just a bare assertion to satisfy the burden of beyond a reasonable doubt. Whilst I had no doubt that V did feel something come into contact with her head and her buttock, I found that there was a reasonable doubt that it was the Accused’s private part.</a></p><a id="p1_177"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a><a id="p1_178">178&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly I found that these 2 charges not to have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, not because of the lack of veracity of V’s evidence but rather due to lack of sufficient quality in the evidence.

In this regard sentencing bands had been promulgated to cover the span of up to the statutory maximum of 5 years:</a></p><a id="p1_188"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_188"></a><a id="p1_188-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Band 1: less than one year’s imprisonment;</a></p><a id="p1_188-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_188-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_188-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Band 2: one to three years’ imprisonment; and</a></p><a id="p1_188-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_188-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_188-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Band 3: three to five years’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_188-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_189">189&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step is to determine which is the appropriate band the present offence should fall in. I herewith set out the following non-exhaustive offence-specific factors laid out in GBR and its application to the facts of the present case:</a></p><a id="p1_189"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The degree of sexual exploitation </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a><a id="p1_190">190&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The degree of sexual exploitation in the present case is moderate. It was not prolonged, however neither was it fleeting. The Accused had pulled V’s legs towards him, spreading them out and until her groin came into contact with his private part. V pulled away and the Accused pulled her towards him again to cause contact again. While it was over the clothing, nonetheless, it was contact between their respective private parts and that is certainly fairly intrusive as it simulated the act of sexual intercourse.</a></p><a id="p1_190"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The circumstances of the offence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a><a id="p1_191">191&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no high degree of premeditation. It would appear to be an opportunistic act done by the Accused during a situation where he was alone with V in the living room. However, there was some deception involved in that V had been put in a vulnerable position, having allowed herself to be massaged by the Accused. The Accused was in a position to physically commit the offence as V was lying on the couch and would have been caught unawares when the Accused moved from merely massaging her back to pulling her legs towards him to commit the sexual offence.</a></p><a id="p1_191"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_191"></a><a id="p1_192">192&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This point is linked to the factor of abuse of a position of trust. V was willing to be massaged by the Accused because of the relationship that had existed between them. Even though their relationship was not very close given the language difficulty, nonetheless, it would appear that they had shared a familial kind of relationship. The Accused being V’s mother’s boyfriend, had played a fatherly role to V. He cooked for her regularly, had gone on an outing together to Snow City and he had played together with her, such as washing each other’s hair and games with her friends. If not for this relationship, the Accused would not be in a position to have committed the offence. The relationship between him and the V’s mother had also inevitably given rise to difficulty in V disclosing the offence immediately and hence detection of the offence was delayed for some time.</a></p><a id="p1_192"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a><a id="p1_193">193&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst section 354(2) of the Penal Code is itself a provision that deals with outrage of modesty of a young child below the age of 14, it has been accepted in <em>GBR</em> that the framework should not treat all offences against minors equally and that if the victim was materially younger than the stipulated age, that would be considered an aggravating factor.</a></p><a id="p1_193"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a><a id="p1_194">194&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This factor would be relevant in the present case as V was clearly materially younger than the stipulated age by a significant period of 5 years. Her young age has certainly increased her vulnerability which has been exploited by the Accused.</a></p><a id="p1_194"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Harm caused to the victim</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a><a id="p1_195">195&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately for V, when she was assessed by Dr Woo on 8 April 2019, she was found to be “not sad or fearful and her sleep and appetite are unaffected<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a>”. Nonetheless, V was no doubt psychologically affected by the offending act of the Accused as evidenced by her messages to her mother. She had also expressed that keeping silent about it had been gnawing at her to the extent of feeling pain inside her.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196">196&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt going through a trial has further exacerbated her pain as the trial had to be stopped several times to allow her to compose herself when she broke down during the period when she was asked in more details about the offending acts committed on her.</a></p><a id="p1_196"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Calibration of the sentence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196"></a><a id="p1_197">197&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there are clearly more than 2 aggravating factors as set out above, I agree that the facts of this case fall within Band 2 of the sentencing framework. In view of the numerous aggravating factors particularly the manner in which the offence was committed and the young age of V, this would be a case at the mid-level of Band 2.</a></p><a id="p1_197"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a><a id="p1_198">198&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no further aggravating factors which are personal to the Accused to warrant a further upward calibration of the sentence. As for mitigating factors, the Accused is not entitled to any sentencing discount as he had claimed trial. His personal circumstances are not exceptional. As for the testimonials tendered, given the seriousness of the offence, the sentencing principle of deterrence would outweigh any mitigating effect. Hence I found there is no need to adjust the sentence downwards.</a></p><a id="p1_198"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a><a id="p1_199">199&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accordingly sentenced the Accused to 18 months’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_199"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_199"></a><a id="p1_200">200&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for caning, as noted in <em>GBR</em> at [31], caning should be imposed where a victim’s private parts or sexual organs have been intruded, a factor which is present in this case. Here there are other additional aggravating factors, caning should be imposed and I accordingly imposed 3 strokes.</a></p><a id="p1_200"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">CONCLUSION</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200"></a><a id="p1_201">201&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the overall criminality of the Accused and the harm caused to the victim, I am of the view that the appropriate sentence to ensure sufficient general deterrence effect is 18 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane and I so ordered.</a></p><a id="p1_201"> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"></a><p
