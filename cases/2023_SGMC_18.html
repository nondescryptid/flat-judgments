P4 shows the accused standing on Buffalo Road, oblivious to the danger posed by moving traffic.

While they were talking, the accused hit PW3 on the head twice before PW3 retaliated by slapping the accused twice on the face. Thereafter, the CCTV footage<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a> showed the accused pulling PW3’s arm towards the railing. There was a minor scuffle with the accused and PW3, each on either side of the railing before they moved out of sight of the CCTV.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst they were out of the field of view of the CCTV, both the accused and PW3 continued with their scuffle.</a></p><a id="p1_4-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_4-p2_e">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third and final part of their continued scuffle was captured by a POLCAM<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a>. This occurred nearby, a short while later, on the opposite side of Buffalo Road. The footage showed that the accused and PW3 standing near a carpark gantry, having apparently ceased their hostilities. Together with them was one Subramaniam A/L Rajindra (“PW6”), a friend of the accused, who was standing between the two protagonists, trying to calm things down.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_f">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the accused who once again initiate the fight. From the POLCAM footage, the accused can be seen suddenly closing the distance between him and PW3, rushing past PW6, and swinging his right hand, hitting PW3 on his face.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a> This caused PW3 to stumble backwards.

The accused suffered a laceration on his head that was caused by being hit by the wooden plank.

He had fought with one Heng by punching and kicking him. Heng suffered a nasal bone fracture and other minor injuries. The offender also suffered some minor injuries occasioned by a fall. The offender was fined $2,000 by a district court. The High Court allowed the Prosecution’s appeal and substituted the fine with a two-week imprisonment term.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At [36] – [37] See J held that, in determining whether the custodial threshold had been crossed, the court had to first analyse the level of harm and culpability as well as have regard to other mitigating and aggravating factors that do not relate to the commission of the offence <em>per se</em>. A fine would suffice where there is a low level of harm caused and a low level of culpability. On the other hand, a custodial sentence would be warranted where there is a higher level of harm and culpability.</a></p><a id="p1_9"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the custodial threshold had been crossed in the present case</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following from <em>Goh Jun Hao</em>, I proceeded to analyse the facts in the present case:</a></p><a id="p1_10"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_10-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Degree of harm</u>. The harm suffered by PW3 is similar to that suffered by Heng in <em>Goh Jun Hao</em>,<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a> namely a nasal bone fracture. Accordingly, I would similarly assess the degree of harm to be at least moderate to high. As highlighted by the High Court in <em>Goh Jun Hao</em>, a nasal bone fracture would be classified as grievous hurt under s 320(g) of the PC. I therefore disagreed with the Defence that the injuries caused to PW3 were minor.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Culpability</u>. In <em>Goh Jun Hao</em>, the offender initiated the fight as Heng was walking away. He punched Heng’s face and kicked him before Heng retaliated. See J assessed the offender’s culpability as being significant.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a> In the present case, the was drunk and also took needless offence at a perceived provocation from PW3. From the CCTV footage (P4) and the POLCAM footage, it was pertinently obvious that it was the accused that was the initiator of the fight in both instances. However, the accused’s acts against PW3 were, in my view, less violent than that of the offender in <em>Goh Jun Hao</em>. Accordingly, whilst I was prepared to assess the accused’s culpability as being significant, I found it to be less than the offender in <em>Goh Jun Hao</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Aggravating factors</u>. The most significant aggravating factor, in my view, was the fact that the accused was on bail for a similar offence of affray when he committed the present offence. The accused was charged for the present offence on 13 December 2021. However, he was originally charged on 18 December 2019 for four PC offences including one for affray under s 267B, two for voluntarily causing hurt on grave and sudden provocation under s 334 (including one with common intention) and one for voluntarily causing hurt under s 323. The accused pleaded guilty to the offences of affray and voluntarily causing hurt on grave and sudden provocation with common intention on 17 February 2022 and was sentenced to a fine $2,000 and an imprisonment term of five days respectively.</a></p><a id="p1_10-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_10-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Other factors</u>. The Prosecution had highlighted other aggravating factors in their sentencing submission. My assessment of these factors are as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_10-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_10-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_10-p2_d-p3_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The age difference</em>. An age difference is usually highlighted because the younger person would usually have an advantage over the older one in a fight. In the present case, the CCTV and POLCAM showed that the age difference did not appear to disadvantage PW3 in anyway. For example, it did not stop him from using the wooden plank to hit the accused on the head. Also, the actual fight itself was of an extremely short duration and my assessment is that this factor did not give the accused any significant advantage. I hence put little weight on this factor.</a></p><a id="p1_10-p2_d-p3_i"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_10-p2_d-p3_i"></a><a id="p1_10-p2_d-p3_ii">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Public disquiet</em>. While the fight took place on a weekday afternoon, the CCTV and POLCAM footage does not appear to show any impact on public disorder.</a></p><a id="p1_10-p2_d-p3_ii"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10-p2_d-p3_ii"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, having looked and the harm caused, the accused’s culpability and the aggravating factors, I assessed that the custodial threshold in the present case was crossed.</a></p><a id="p1_11"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I next considered the mitigating factors highlighted by the Defence and my views. These were as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_12"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_12-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>No weapons were used</u>. I note that no weapons were used by the accused. In the same breath, I note that PW3 had used a wooden plank to hit the accused as seen in P5.</a></p><a id="p1_12-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_12-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Short duration</u>. While the confrontation between PW3 and the accused stretched over a period of time, I agreed that the actual altercation lasted only for a short duration. There was no prolonged fight between the two of them and it did not require anyone to break it up. This is unlike in <em>Goh Jun Hao</em> where the fight between the offender and Heng appeared to carry on and required the intervention of the bouncers from the night club to stop it;<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>No premeditation</u>. Generally speaking, offences of affray are committed without premeditation, hence I put little weight on this.</a></p><a id="p1_12-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_12-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>No group element</u>. Whilst I accept that there was no group element in the present case, this was, in my view, not a mitigating factor but simply a lack of an aggravating factor.</a></p><a id="p1_12-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_12-p2_e">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Co-operation with the police</u>. While co-operation with the police is generally considered as a mitigating factor, the facts of the case were, in my view, relatively straight forward. There was ample <em>objective</em> evidence to show what really happened. Therefore, while I did consider this factor, I put very little weight on it.</a></p><a id="p1_12-p2_e"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_e"></a><a id="p1_12-p2_f">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Remorse and regret</u>. In my assessment, the supposed feelings of remorse and regret felt by the accused were simply because he had been convicted for the offence whilst the co-accused, PW3, was administered with a stern warning.</a></p><a id="p1_12-p2_f"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12-p2_f"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having considered the mitigating factors in the present case, I found that there was nothing to warrant a downward adjustment of the sentence to one that was below the custodial threshold.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All considered, I was therefore of the view that the acts of the accused in the present case crossed the custodial threshold.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the circumstances in the present case were less egregious than in <em>Goh Jun Hao</em>, where the offender therein was sentenced to two weeks imprisonment. I adjudged that the appropriate sentence in the present case to be:</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id=""> <b><em>seven days’ imprisonment.</em></b> </a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, as highlighted by the Prosecution, this sentence is not out of line with the median imprisonment term imposed on offenders where the custodial sentence has been held to have been crossed.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused, being dissatisfied with the sentence I have imposed now appeals against it.
