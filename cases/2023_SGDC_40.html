Thus, says the Respondent, pursuant to para 14(2)(<em>a</em>) of the Fourth Schedule to the BMSMA (which s 32(2) of the BMSMA is expressly subject to (see [12] above)), the prescribed by-laws in force in Fort Gardens are those set out in the First Schedule to the repealed Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158, 1999 Rev Ed) (“LTSA”), and <em>not</em> those set out in the Second Schedule to the BMSMR.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> Paragraph 14(2)(<em>a</em>) of the Fourth Schedule to the BMSMA provides as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) Subject to sub-paragraph (3), the by-laws in force for any parcel comprised in a strata title plan in respect of which a management corporation continued by the operation of paragraph 10 is constituted are the following by-laws in force immediately before 1 April 2005:</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>the by-laws set out in the First Schedule to the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap. 158, 1999 Revised Edition) repealed by this Act</em>; and</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For completeness, and as the Respondent highlights, the First Schedule to the LTSA does not include a by-law equivalent to para 2(2) of the Second Schedule to the BMSMR.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Applicant, in response, accepts that para 2(2) of the Second Schedule to the BMSMR does not form part of the Respondent’s by-laws. In this sense, the Respondent is not <em>directly</em> bound by para 2(2) of the Second Schedule to the BMSMR. However, the Applicant argues that the Respondent is still <em>indirectly</em> bound by para 2(2) of the Second Schedule to the BMSMR. Specifically, the argument is that by virtue of s 32(2) of the BMSMA, any additional by-law made by the Respondent post-BMSMA (and this includes the Parking By-Law, which was made on 17 October 2011<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a>) cannot be inconsistent with the by-laws in the Second Schedule to the BMSMR, including para 2(2) thereof. In support of this, the Applicant points to how the reference to “prescribed” by-laws in s 32(2) of the BMSMA is also found in the BMSMR. In contrast, the by-laws in the First Schedule to the LTSA are simply referred to as “by-laws”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I deal first with the last-mentioned point. In relation to by-laws, the term “prescribed” in the BMSMA seems to simply refer to the by-laws <em>prescribed by statute</em>, in contradistinction to the additional by-laws <em>made by a management corporation</em>. In my view, therefore, the reference to “prescribed” by-laws in s 32(2) of the BMSMA is neither here nor there. The real question is whether, for management corporations constituted before 1 April 2005, the reference to “any such prescribed by-law” in s 32(2) of the BMSMA is a reference to the by-laws in the Second Schedule to the BMSMR (such that the Respondent is bound (albeit only indirectly) by para 2(2) of the Second Schedule to the BMSMR) or the by-laws in the First Schedule to the LTSA (such that the Respondent is not).</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my judgment, for management corporations constituted before 1 April 2005, the reference to “any such prescribed by-law” in s 32(2) of the BMSMA is a reference to the by-laws in the First Schedule to the LTSA. As the Respondent submits, the opposing interpretation would lead to an illogical result: the Respondent would be (directly) bound by the by-laws in the First Schedule to the LTSA, but then cannot make by-laws that are inconsistent with a second set of by-laws, namely, those in the Second Schedule to the BMSMR. This makes no sense. Neither party has submitted on the purpose of the second half of s 32(2) of the BMSMA, but I think it is simply to ensure that any additional by-laws made by a management corporation do not undermine the by-laws prescribed by statute. This being the case, the reference point must be the by-laws prescribed by statute which are applicable to the <em>particular</em> management corporation in question. And for management corporations constituted before 1 April 2005, these would be the by-laws in the First Schedule to the LTSA.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, I find that the Respondent is not bound by para 2(2) of the Second Schedule to the BMSMR, whether directly or indirectly.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Parking By-Law is unreasonable</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have found that the Respondent is not bound by para 2(2) of the Second Schedule to the BMSMR, it is not necessary for me to consider whether the Parking By-Law is unreasonable.

Rather, it is whether the Parking By-Law constitutes an unreasonable <em>withholding of approval</em> in relation to the parking of a vehicle on the common property, such that it is inconsistent with para 2(2) of the Second Schedule to the BMSMR. Notwithstanding, because the inquiry invited by both questions is substantively the same, I am prepared to use the reasonableness of the Parking By-Law as a proxy for determining whether the Parking By-Law is inconsistent with para 2(2) of the Second Schedule to the BMSMR.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, the Respondent submits that an assessment of the reasonableness of the Parking By-Law involves a consideration of two factors: (a) whether there is a good reason for the Parking By-Law; and (b) whether the Parking By-Law is onerous. I agree that these are valid factors. The Respondent says that the Parking By-Law is reasonable because: (a) there is a good reason for the Parking By-Law; and (b) the Parking By-Law is not onerous.

By requiring the vehicle log card to be produced, the Parking By-Law allows the Respondent to verify that the applicant: (a) is a resident at Fort Gardens; and (b) is the owner of the vehicle. The Respondent must be able to verify <em>both</em> of these facts if it wants to meaningfully stem the abuse. In contrast, requiring only the applicant’s NRIC to be produced (which the Applicant says is sufficient<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>) would only allow the Respondent to verify (a) but not (b).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Applicant refers to a few hypothetical scenarios to show that the Parking By-Law is unreasonable. These include how: (a) the vehicle may be driven by a resident who does not own the vehicle (<em>eg</em>, a son who is a resident at Fort Gardens but who drives a vehicle owned by his non-resident parent, or a company director who is a resident at Fort Gardens but who drives a vehicle owned and provided to him by his company); and (b) the vehicle may be driven and owned by a person who only lives in Fort Gardens periodically because he owns multiple properties.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a> In these scenarios, the driver of the vehicle is a resident at Fort Gardens and, according to the Applicant, should be permitted to park at Fort Gardens.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I can see the logic of the argument, these scenarios do not bring the Applicant very far. First, these scenarios are exceptional; they are not common everyday scenarios. Second, there is no evidence that in these exceptional scenarios, the Respondent would not issue car park labels on an exceptional basis. Third, the Applicant is not contending that <em>he</em> falls into any of these scenarios; insofar as he is concerned, any alleged unreasonableness on this basis is purely hypothetical.</a></p><a id="p1_27"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the above reasons, I agree with the Respondent that there is a good reason for the Parking By-Law, and this, in turn, is a factor that points towards the reasonableness of the Parking By-Law.</a></p><a id="p1_28"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the Parking By-Law is onerous</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned earlier (see [9] above), the Respondent highlights that changing the address on one’s NRIC would automatically result in the change also being reflected on his vehicle log card. Moreover, says the Respondent, a vehicle log card can be easily retrieved online via the three steps set out on the LTA’s website. <em>If</em> the Respondent is correct, the only steps involved in complying with the Parking By-Law are: (a) updating one’s NRIC to reflect his Fort Gardens address (which one is legally required to do anyway, pursuant to s 10(1) of the National Registration Act 1965); and (b) producing a copy of the vehicle log card to the Respondent. These cannot be said to be onerous by any standard.</a></p><a id="p1_29"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Applicant has updated his NRIC to reflect his Fort Gardens address (see [3] above).

This is what I gather from parties’ responses to my question, at the start of the hearing on 3 February 2023, as to whether the only steps standing between the Applicant and a car park label were the Applicant printing a copy of his vehicle log card and producing it to the Respondent. Counsel for the Respondent confirmed that this was the Respondent’s position, save that the Applicant did not even need to print a copy of his vehicle log card; he could simply send an electronic copy to the Respondent. However, Counsel for the Applicant stated that the Applicant had in fact attempted to retrieve his vehicle log card on his mobile phone, but it did not show his Fort Gardens address.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given these circumstances, I proceeded with the hearing but granted the Applicant leave to file a supplementary affidavit deposing to the fact that his vehicle log card does not show his Fort Gardens address. I also granted the Respondent leave to file a further reply affidavit, and gave parties liberty to write in if they wished to make further oral arguments. Neither party eventually took up this latter offer.</a></p><a id="p1_31"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Applicant’s supplementary affidavit was duly filed and exhibits screenshots of what Applicant says is his vehicle log card.

Indeed, it does not show <em>any</em> registered address (in the sense that there is not even a <em>field</em> for a registered address).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I make two points about these screenshots. First, the Respondent had previously, in its reply affidavit, already set out the three steps involved in retrieving a vehicle log card (see [9] above). The Respondent did this by exhibiting a screenshot of the LTA’s website which contained these steps, so there is no question of the veracity of these steps. The first of these steps involves logging in to the LTA’s OneMotoring website. However, as the Respondent points out, despite clearly having read the Respondent’s reply affidavit, the Applicant chose not to follow this simple and unambiguous step.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a> Instead, he disingenuously chose to log in to something completely different, <em>ie</em>, his Singpass application.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I agree with the Respondent that these screenshots are not screenshots of the Applicant’s vehicle log card.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a> In the Respondent’s further reply affidavit, screenshots of a vehicle log card retrieved by one of the Respondent’s management council members from the LTA’s OneMotoring website are exhibited.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> In these screenshots (which, I should add, were clearly taken using a mobile phone, so there is no question of a different type of device being used), the title of the page is “Vehicle Registration Details”. This is, in fact, the LTA’s official term for a vehicle log card (see [9] above). There is also a field for a registered address in the vehicle log card. Plainly, this, and not what the Applicant exhibited in his supplementary affidavit, is what a vehicle log card should look like.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upshot of all of this is that there is not a shred of evidence to support the Applicant’s claim that his vehicle log card does not bear his Fort Gardens address. Moreover, because the Applicant could, but did not, produce his vehicle log card, the present case falls squarely within illus (<em>g</em>) to s 116 of the Evidence Act 1893, which provides as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_35"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>Court may presume existence of certain fact</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>116</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct, and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"></p><div align="center"> <em>Illustrations</em> </div><p></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court may presume —</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>g</em>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it;</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, the applicable presumption is that the Applicant’s vehicle log card bears his Fort Gardens address. The Applicant’s claim to the contrary is wholly unbelievable. Accordingly, I find that the Applicant’s vehicle log card bears his Fort Gardens address. Whether for the Applicant or for the other residents at Fort Gardens, the only steps involved in complying with the Parking By-Law are the non-onerous steps of: (a) updating one’s NRIC to reflect his Fort Gardens address; and (b) producing a copy of the vehicle log card to the Respondent (see [29] above).</a></p><a id="p1_36"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the above reasons, I agree with the Respondent that the Parking By-Law is not onerous, and this, in turn, is another factor that points towards the reasonableness of the Parking By-Law. As there is a good reason for the Parking By-Law, and as the Parking By-Law is not onerous, I find that the Parking By-Law is not unreasonable.</a></p><a id="p1_37"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on Issue 1</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarise, I find that the Respondent is not bound by para 2(2) of the Second Schedule to the BMSMR (see [15]-[20] above). Even if I am wrong on this, I find that the Parking By-Law is not unreasonable (see [21]-[37] above). On Issue 1, I conclude that the Parking By-Law is not invalid on the basis that it contravenes s 32(2) of the BMSMA.</a></p><a id="p1_38"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the Parking By-Law is invalid because it is discriminatory</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starting point for Issue 2 is the decision of the Strata Titles Board in <em>Roland Yeo Peng Sin/Chan Mei Yoke and Others v MCST Plan No 2054</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Decision/84807-M.xml')">[2014] SGSTB 1</a>), which the Applicant relies on. In that case, the Strata Titles Board observed (at [20]) that “a by-law that is discriminatory in its application will qualify for repeal”. Pursuant to this, the Applicant submits that the Parking By-Law unfairly, illogically and unreasonably discriminates against residents whose vehicles are registered to non-Fort Gardens addresses. To the extent that this submission touches also on the rationale for the Parking By-Law, I have already dealt with this under Issue 1 (see [24]-[28] above). I will therefore confine myself to considering the only fresh point raised by this submission, which is that the Parking By-Law should be repealed because it differentiates between residents whose vehicles are registered to Fort Gardens addresses and residents whose vehicles are registered to non-Fort Gardens addresses.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I start by reproducing the part of the Strata Titles Board’s decision where the observation in question is found:</a></p><a id="p1_40"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discriminatory:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">S105 provides that a Board can repeal additional by-laws and amendments to existing by-laws and revive revoked by-laws after considering the interests of all subsidiary proprietors in the use and enjoyment of their lots or the common property. Clearly a by-law that is discriminatory in its application will qualify for repeal.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a><a id="p1_41">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I make two points. First, the basis for the Strata Titles Board’s observation was s 105(1) of the BMSMA. However, all s 105(1) of the BMSMA says is that an amendment or repeal of a by-law or addition of a new by-law is liable to be repealed or revived (as the case may be) by the Strata Titles Board if, “having regard to the interest of all subsidiary proprietors in the use and enjoyment of their lots or the common property or limited common property”, it should not have been made or effected:</a></p><a id="p1_41"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>Order revoking amendment of by-law</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>105.</b>—(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, pursuant to an application by any person entitled to vote at a meeting of the management corporation or subsidiary management corporation (including both a first mortgagee and a mortgagor of a lot), a Board considers that, <em>having regard to the interest of all subsidiary proprietors in the use and enjoyment of their lots or the common property or limited common property</em> (as the case may be), an amendment or repeal of a by-law or addition of a new by-law should not have been made or effected, the Board may order that the amendment be repealed, that the revoked by-law be revived or that the additional by-law be repealed.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a><a id="p1_42">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What s 105(1) of the BMSMA does not say is that an additional by-law that involves a differentiating measure is, <em>ipso facto</em>, liable to be repealed. Given the language of s 105(1) of the BMSMA, what the Strata Titles Board was probably intending to say was that an additional by-law that involves a differentiating measure is liable to be repealed under s 105(1) of the BMSMA <em>if</em> the differentiating measure negatively impacts “the interest of all subsidiary proprietors in the use and enjoyment of their lots or the common property or limited common property”. This is also consistent with how the law does not generally regard a rule as invalid <em>just because</em> it involves a differentiating measure (see, <em>eg</em>, the “reasonable classification” test in the realm of constitutional law, recently summarised by the Court of Appeal in <em>Tan Seng Kee v Attorney-General and other appeals</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/27864-SSP.xml')">[2022] 1 SLR 1347</a> at [305]). In the present case, however, the Applicant is not contending (and, given the rationale for the Parking By-Law (see [24]-[28] above), I do not think he can validly contend) that the Parking By-Law has <em>this</em> sort of impact.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43">43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Applicant’s submission, to reiterate, is that the Parking By-Law discriminates against residents whose vehicles are registered to non-Fort Gardens addresses. However, I have found that the Applicant’s vehicle log card bears his Fort Gardens address (see [36] above). In other words, the Applicant is not even a victim of the alleged discrimination he complains of.</a></p><a id="p1_43"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a><a id="p1_44">44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the above reasons, I am of the view that, in answer to Issue 2, the Parking By-Law is not invalid on the basis that it is discriminatory.</a></p><a id="p1_44"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the Applicant is entitled to the reliefs sought </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a><a id="p1_45">45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given my finding that the Parking By-Law is not invalid (see [38] and [44] above), I do not need to decide Issue 3. However, I will set out some brief observations on Issue 3 for completeness.</a></p><a id="p1_45"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a><a id="p1_46">46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I start by observing that the reliefs sought (which are contained in prayers 1, 2 and 3 of the originating application (see [6] above)) are reliefs contingent on a finding that the Parking By-Law is <em>invalid</em>. However, some difficulty arises here because the primary provisions having to do with the enforcement of by-laws in the BMSMA are ss 32(10) and 32(11) of the BMSMA, which provide as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_46"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(10)&nbsp;&nbsp;The management corporation or subsidiary proprietor, mortgagee in possession, lessee or occupier of a lot is entitled to apply to the court —</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for an order to enforce the performance of or restrain the breach of any by-law by; or</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to recover damages for any loss or injury to person or property arising out of the breach of any by-law from,</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">any person bound to comply therewith, the management corporation or the managing agent.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(11)&nbsp;&nbsp;The court may make such order against any such person, the management corporation or the members of its council, or the managing agent, as the court thinks fit.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a><a id="p1_47">47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is immediately evident is that the reliefs referred to in s 32(10) and (11) of the BMSMA are premised on a <em>valid</em> by-law. Unsurprisingly, therefore, the reliefs sought in the originating application do not fall within the description of the reliefs referred to in ss 32(10) and 32(11) of the BMSMA. Accordingly, it appears that the Applicant cannot avail himself of ss 32(10) and 32(11) of the BMSMA.</a></p><a id="p1_47"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a><a id="p1_48">48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Applicant, however, relies on the decision of the High Court in <em>Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 901 v Lian Tat Huat Trading Pte Ltd</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22496-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGHC 270</a> (“<em>Lian Tat Huat Trading</em>”). In that case, the High Court struck out a claim on the basis, <em>inter alia</em>, that the by-law which the plaintiff management corporation was seeking to enforce against the defendant subsidiary proprietor was beyond the powers. In the course of its decision, the High Court held (at [30]) that the management corporation “could only have such powers that were expressly or impliedly granted under the BMSMA, and anything it did outside of these powers would have been void <em>ab initio</em>”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49">49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the decision in <em>Lian Tat Huat Trading</em> does not assist the Applicant. In that case, the subsidiary proprietor was not seeking <em>substantive reliefs</em> on the basis of an invalid by-law. Rather, the subsidiary proprietor had filed an application to <em>procedurally strike out</em> the management corporation’s claim pursuant to O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed). In the present case, the Applicant is seeking substantive reliefs on the basis of the alleged invalidity of the Parking By-Law. The decision in <em>Lian Tat Huat Trading</em> does not stand for the proposition that this is possible notwithstanding ss 32(10) and (11) of the BMSMA.</a></p><a id="p1_49"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a><a id="p1_50">50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, in view of s 123 of the BMSMA, it appears that the Applicant may still rely on the provisions relating to the District Court’s <em>general</em> jurisdiction and powers in the State Courts Act 1970 (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Diora-Ace Ltd and others v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 3661 and another</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17477-SSP.xml')">[2015] 3 SLR 620</a> at [23]-[43]). However, as I did not receive full submissions on this point, and as Issue 3 does not arise in the present case, I will confine my observations on Issue 3 to the above.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51">51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I return to the issues identified at [11] above. On Issue 1, I find that the Parking By-Law is not invalid on the basis that it contravenes s 32(2) of the BMSMA (see [38] above). As for Issue 2, I find that the Parking By-Law is not invalid on the basis that it is discriminatory (see [44] above). In view of these findings, it is not necessary for me to decide Issue 3 (see [45] above). In the circumstances, I dismiss the originating application in its entirety.</a></p><a id="p1_51"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a><a id="p1_52">52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I conclude with two observations about the Applicant’s conduct leading up to, and in, these proceedings. First, it appears that the Applicant did not even view the Parking By-Law before commencing this action. This was despite the Respondent offering him the opportunity to view the Additional By-Laws on at least two occasions (see [5(e)] and [5(g)] above). The Applicant now alleges that the Parking By-Law was not provided to him despite him having requested it,<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a> but this allegation is specious. The Applicant’s requests (see [5(d)] and [5(h)] above) were for the Additional By-Laws to be supplied to him <em>free of charge</em>,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> which was not something the Respondent was obliged to do (see s 32(8)(<em>c</em>) of the BMSMA).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53">53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, even when it should have become obvious that the only steps standing between the Applicant and a car park label were the Applicant printing (or downloading) a copy of his vehicle log card and producing it to the Respondent, the Applicant persisted with this originating application and claimed that his vehicle log card did not show his Fort Gardens address. I have found this claim to be wholly unbelievable in the context of considering the reasonableness of the Parking By-Law (see [30]-[36] above). But quite apart from that, the point I make here is that the Applicant could have simply taken these steps. Had he done so, this entire dispute would have fallen away. However, instead of taking this eminently sensible course, he conjured up a factual basis to keep this dispute alive.</a></p><a id="p1_53"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a><a id="p1_54">54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this compels me to conclude that the Applicant has never been interested in the legal merits of this originating application. Nor has he even been interested in obtaining a car park label. To use the language of the Court of Appeal in <em>Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1997] 3 SLR(R) 0649.xml')">[1997] 3 SLR(R) 649</a> (at [22]), his only interest has been in using the judicial process to vex and oppress the Respondent. Indeed, this originating application, with its highly emotive, but ultimately baseless, claims of unreasonableness and discrimination, has been a quintessential abuse of process from start to finish.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55">55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I direct that parties file written submissions, limited to five pages each, on the issue of costs. These are to be filed within two weeks of the date of this judgment and, in view of my observations in the preceding paragraphs, should also address whether this is an appropriate case for indemnity costs to be ordered.</a></p><a id="p1_55"> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"></a><p class="Footnote"><a id="p1_55"><sup></sup></a><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a>Affidavit of Manohar K
