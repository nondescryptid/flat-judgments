Dr Guo’s opinion was that although Cheo was in a state of “en-bloc amnesia” at the material time, he was still conscious of what he was doing, or he would have had clear intentions for his actions:</a></p><a id="p1_21"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused is likely to have been in a state of Alcohol Induced Amnesia (blackout) during the course of the alleged incident as he stated that he could not remember the exact sequence of events despite the fact that he was seen to be moving around consciously, joining the fight and even hitting the victims with his bare hand.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alcohol induced blackout is defined as a transient form of cognitive impairment where the memory consolidation (transformation from short term memory to long term memory) is affected by a high level of alcohol in the blood stream. A person with alcohol induced amnesia experiences a lapse of memory where they are unable to remember the events after the onset of the amnesia (anterograde amnesia) while sustaining other memories. The memory loss can be partial (segmental amnesia) or complete (en-bloc amnesia). <em>Although a person in alcohol induced amnesia cannot remember what they have done, they will still be conscious of their behaviours, be able to understand their actions, be aware of the happenings around them, and be able to respond relevantly.</em> The person may also be capable of carrying out more complex actions such as driving a vehicle. However, <em>as the brain function is under the influence of alcohol, people experiencing amnesia may exhibit disinhibition and poor judgement in decision making which is commonly seen in alcohol intoxication and so they are likely to commit offences which they might otherwise not commit in a sober state</em> (Reference 3).</p> </a><p class="Judg-Quote-1"><a id="p1_21">24.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the accused person’s subjective account, his behaviours observed by the witnesses and the objective BAC evidence confirming his alcohol intoxication, my opinion is that <em>he was in a state of en-bloc amnesia at the time of the alleged incident. This means that he should have been still conscious of what he was doing or he would have had clear intentions for his actions, in other words, he was not of unsound mind at the time of alleged incident</em>. However, his decision making might have been imprudent and so he could have behaved irresponsibly due to the dis-inhibitory effects of alcohol. Hence, I am not fully agreeable with Dr Tan’s conclusion.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"></p><div align="right">[Emphasis <em>in italics</em> added] </div><p></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among Dr Guo’s references was an extract from <em>Ethanol Forensic Toxicology</em>, J Am Acad Psychiatry Law 45:429–38, 2017 (pp 435-6), which made the point that a person suffering an alcoholic “blackout” could still have the ability to form the specific intent needed to commit crimes:<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">It has been stated that “[an alcoholic blackout] is not forgetting, rather it is not remembering,” implying that, at a high BAC, new memories cannot be formed.

One reason for this, as Dr Phang explained during his examination-in-chief, is that it is not uncommon for accused persons to exaggerate or malinger symptoms in order to escape liability. Compounding this risk is the fact that the diagnostic criteria of many diseases and disorders are readily available through the Internet. Conversely, it is also possible that accused persons may downplay their symptoms or be in a state of denial: see <em>Ong Pang Siew</em> at [43].

Not all experts are of equal authority and/or reliability. In so far as medical evidence is concerned, an expert with greater relevant clinical experience may often prove to be more credible and reliable on “hands-on” issues although this is not an inevitable rule of thumb. Having said that, there is no precise pecking order or hierarchy relating to expert evidence. Experts may sometimes be abundantly eminent while lacking credibility in a particular matter.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48">48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Dr Mak and Dr&nbsp;Guo possessed more relevant qualifications and had considerably more experience than Dr Tan in the areas of alcohol intoxication and forensic psychiatry.</a></p><a id="p1_48"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a><a id="p1_49">49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Mak was employed as a Consultant at the National Addictions Management Service (NAMS) at the IMH. In addition to his qualifications which were a prerequisite for practice as a psychiatrist (MBChB, MRCPsych), he obtained a Masters in Addiction Studies (Distinction) from King’s College, London in 2017. He ran an addiction clinic every Monday and Friday, and around 30% of the patients seen at the NAMS were alcohol patients. He had completed two postings in forensic psychiatry during his traineeship, and he had been doing forensic reports ever since he became a registrar in 2012. He did forensic assessments on average around once every two months. He had testified in court numerous times, and he would attend court on several occasions each year.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50">50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Guo was a Senior Consultant at the IMH. He had a Bachelor in Medicine from Beijing Medical College, China; and a Master Degree in Psychiatry from the Capital Medical University in Beijing, China. He also had a PhD in Psychopharmacology from Peking University, China in 2000. (Psychopharmacology is the study of substances, including alcohol, and how these substances affected a human being’s mood, thought and behaviours.) He had been dealing with forensic psychiatry for about 25 years.

His specialist qualification was a Master of Medicine (Psychiatry); and he had a Master of Clinical Investigation, which qualified him as a research scientist. He saw alcohol cases as a psychiatrist, and his most relevant experience was when he was previously with the Changi General Hospital as Director of Consultation Liaison, where he advised on the management of patients with alcohol intoxication.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a> He had done a posting in forensic psychiatry some time ago, but had not received specialised training in forensic psychiatry; and addictions was not one of his subspecialties. He had testified once in court, “last year or the year before”; and his oral testimony had been from the clinical perspective (relating to the treatment of patients). Dr Tan said that while he tried his best to give his opinion on forensic matters, he accepted that he was “lesser than my forensic colleagues”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Cogency in approach and opinions</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52">52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that Dr&nbsp;Mak and Dr&nbsp;Guo had more relevant qualifications and experience, it was reasonable that greater weight be accorded to their opinion.

They also took into account objective facts that had been proven and established.

This was supported by academic authority. In particular, during a “blackout”, individuals with intact immediate and short-term memory have the ability to form the specific intent needed to commit crimes despite their inability to retain their involvement in the crime in their long-term memory (above, at [21]-[22]).

Dr Mak and Dr&nbsp;Guo disagreed with Dr Tan’s opinion that Michael and Cheo were unable to form the necessary criminal intention. As explained above, the opinions of Dr Mak and Dr&nbsp;Guo were more cogent and to be preferred; despite their intoxication, Michael and Cheo retained the ability to form the specific criminal intent for the offence of rioting.</a></p><a id="p1_55"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a><a id="p1_56">56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my judgement, from the evidence heard at the trial, Michael and Cheo did have the requisite <em>mens rea</em>. There was an unlawful assembly comprising Michael, Cheo and the three co-accused persons (Wan Seng, Meng Chong and Regina). They shared a common object to hurt the victims, and each one of them was an active participant in causing hurt to one or more of the victims.</a></p><a id="p1_56"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a><a id="p1_57">57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Lim Thiam Hor and another v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1996] 1 SLR(R) 0758.xml')">[1996] 1 SLR(R) 758</a>, the High Court explained (at [13] and [17]) that the common object of an assembly is an inference of fact to be deduced from the facts and circumstances of the case, and an unlawful object can develop suddenly, on the spot after the offenders gather at the scene of occurrence:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[…] [A]ll that is required to constitute an unlawful assembly is that (a)&nbsp;the assembly must consist of five or more persons; and (b)&nbsp;the assembly should have as its common object one or more of the objects stated in s&nbsp;141. […] It was not in dispute that the object here was to cause hurt to PW1 which fell within s&nbsp;141(<em>c</em>) of the Penal Code. However, the assembly must be animated by a common object. <em>This common object is an inference of fact to be deduced from the facts and circumstances of each case.</em> Such an inference may be arrived at by considering the nature of the assembly, the weapons used by the offenders and the behaviour of the assembly at or before the scene of occurrence. But it is essential that the object should be common to the persons who constitute the assembly and they should be aware of it and concur in it.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[…]</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[…] [F]or there to be a common object, there is no need to even go so far to find a common intention. It is true that the two may overlap sometimes but in an offence involving unlawful assembly, <em>the law requires only a common object. This means that there is no requirement of a prior meeting of the minds or preconcert from the offenders before the formation of the assembly. An unlawful object could develop suddenly, on the spot after the offenders gather at the scene of occurrence. Accordingly, an assembly lawful at its inception may, therefore, convert itself into an unlawful one by the actions of its members.</em></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"></p><div align="right">(Emphasis added)</div><p></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58">58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the remittal hearing, Michael and Cheo sought to pursue a new line of defence: because of their intoxication, their sensory perception was impaired, and they were not aware where Regina was or what she was doing, unaware of there being an assembly of at least five persons, and unaware of any object common to the assembly. At the trial, however, neither Michael nor Cheo gave any evidence in support of such an assertion, nor was such a point put to any of the witnesses. Their defence then was one of bare denial (GD&nbsp;at [34], [47]); and it was also asserted that it was the victims who first assaulted Michael, and the others including Cheo had tried to help Michael and got dragged into the fray (GD at [22]-[26]).

It was a relatively short distance separating them – the width of two to three carpark lots, which Maureen estimated as about 8&nbsp;metres.
