The Accused’s grandmother was on the sofa.</a></p><a id="p1_12"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day-time helper briefed the First Victim and then left the Unit. Shortly thereafter, on the Accused’s instructions, the First Victim put the Accused’s grandmother on a wheelchair without any assistance from the Accused. They went out of the Unit for a short walk as the Accused wanted his grandmother to have some fresh air before settling down for the night. After the walk, the Accused’s grandmother was placed into her room. The Accused’s grandmother was transferred from the wheelchair to the bed. The Accused was dissatisfied with the manner in which she had done the transfer and told her off. Subsequently, there was a change of diaper for the Accused’s grandmother. The Accused was not in the grandmother’s room during the diaper changing. When the Accused came out from his room, he had changed his attire. He had changed into a triangular underwear and a singlet. Thinking that this was a foreigner’s lifestyle, the First Victim let it be.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside the Accused grandmother’s room, the Accused oriented the First Victim to the room and the place where the diapers were kept. In the midst of talking to her, the Accused used his right hand to make circular motion on the First Victim’s left hand. The First Victim was startled by the Accused’s action. But she thought that the Accused was just being friendly.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, the two of them continued their conversation outside the Accused grandmother room. At one stage, the First Victim could feel the Accused’s erect penis was touching her right thigh for about three to five seconds. The First Victim froze momentarily. The First Victim did not confront the Accused. She went back to the grandmother’s room. She felt scared and hoped to get through her shift.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At about 11:30 pm, the Accused returned to his grandmother’s room. On this occasion the Accused was wearing boxers instead of the triangular underwear. He asked the First Victim whether she had brought any food. If she had, she could consume her food if she wanted to. The Victim took out her food, a wrap, to eat. She was eating the wrap just outside the Accused grandmother’s room so that the Accused’s grandmother would remain in her sight.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused told her that the ventilation in his grandmother’s room was poor and suggested to the First Victim to have her food at the sofa in the dining area. When the Accused was talking to her, the Victim felt the erect penis making contact with her right thigh. <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a> It was a repeat of the first incident. Upon the second contact, the First Victim took up the Accused’s suggestion and moved to the dining area. At that moment, the Accused was skipping around the dining table and behind the sofa. It was obvious to the First Victim that the Accused’s penis was in an erect state, albeit underneath his boxers. The First Victim felt very scared. She quickly finished up her wrap and returned to the Accused grandmother’s room.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing untoward happened thereafter. The First Victim eventually completed her duties. The morning after, the First Victim left the Unit. That morning, the First Victim informed PW6, an officer from Caregiver Asia, that she would be making a police report against the Accused. The screenshots of the WhatsApp messages between the First Victim and PW6 were adduced as Exhibit P11.

The First Victim disagreed with the Accused’s version of the events. The Accused also alleged that the First Victim encountered problem with his grandmother in the toilet. The First Victim disagreed. She explained that she did not bring the Accused’s grandmother to the toilet because the Accused’s grandmother was using a diaper.

PW6 testified that in July 2019 the Accused asked for a quotation for nursing services. Arising therefrom, one nurse named Archana was deployed to the Accused’s Unit. Another nurse named Nur Farziah was deployed on a second occasion. PW6 testified that both nurses encountered some unpleasant moments whilst looking after the Accused’s grandmother.

On 4 August 2019, the Second Victim lodged a police report for her case. The nature of the allegations in the police reports were similar – it involved the same offender with incidents occurring at the same location against two victims hired from two different nursing agencies. Pursuant to the lodging of the FIR by the Second Victim, on 4 August 2019 itself, PW1 and two of her colleagues, namely Inspector Chang An Ting Adeline and Staff Sergeant Noor Azhar, went to the Unit to look for the Accused.

As part of her follow up actions, she recorded the cautioned statements of the Accused. During the investigations stage, the Police had released the Accused on a personal bond. When the Police made arrangements to produce the Accused in court, PW5 informed the Accused that he has to arrange for a bailor. The Accused was produced in court on 18 March 2020 and formally charged. The personal bond given to the Accused was revoked by the Court. Court bail was ordered instead.

The Accused stated that he has two full-time caregivers since 2018, and there have been many part-time caregivers. Whether it be caregivers or anyone else, he has never encountered the issues that he had with the two victims.

Section 231(1)(j) provides that the court must call on the accused to give his defence if it is of the view that “there is some evidence which is not inherently incredible and which satisfies each and every element of the charge as framed by the prosecutor or as altered or framed by the court”.</a></p><a id="p1_58"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a><a id="p1_59">59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In applying the said provision, I referred to the case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Wong Wee Kong</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19046-SSP.xml')">[2016] 3 SLR 965</a> at [32] – [34].</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As explained by Chan Sek Keong CJ in <em>Re Nalpon Zero GeraldoMario</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 3 SLR 0440.xml')">[2012] 3 SLR 440</a> (“<em>Re Nalpon</em>”) at [26], this is a statutory codification of the test which was set out in the seminal decision of the Privy Council in <em>Haw Tua Tau v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1981-1982] SLR(R) 0133.xml')">[1981–1982] SLR(R) 133</a> (“<em>Haw Tua Tau</em>”). The question, Chan CJ explained, was not whether the evidence as it presently stood <em>had already</em> established the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt but whether the evidence – <em>if</em> it were all accepted as accurate – <em>would</em> do so (at [26]). At a minimum, the evidence put forward has to cover every constituent element of the offence in question; if it did not, then it would plainly be impossible for a conviction to be lawfully sustained. In deciding whether to call on the accused to enter his defence, regard should be had to the following guiding propositions:</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All evidence of primary fact should be accepted as being true, unless it is so inherently incredible that no reasonable person would be able to accept it as being true or if it has been discredited or shown to be wholly unreliable. This may happen, for example, during the course of cross-examination (see <em>Haw Tua Tau</em> at [15]; <em>Re Nalpon</em> at [25]).</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inferences may be drawn, but only if they are reasonable – it is not enough that the inference may be credible or not inherently incredible. In this regard, there is a different standard which applies to primary facts and inferences insofar as the former should be accepted as true unless it is inherently incredible whereas inferences can only be accepted if they can reasonably be drawn (see <em>Re Nalpon</em> at [25]). It is not necessary that the inference be irresistible or that it must be only possible inference that may be drawn from the facts.</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The totality of the evidence has to be considered when determining whether evidence is so inherently incredible that it can be accepted or if the inferences sought to be drawn are reasonable enough to pass muster. The court cannot only look to those parts of the evidence which are favourable to the prosecution’s case and ignore those which are detrimental: <em>ie</em>, it cannot pick out only the plums and leave the duff behind (see <em>Public Prosecutor v IC Automation (S) Pte Ltd</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1996] 2 SLR(R) 0799.xml')">[1996] 2 SLR(R) 799</a> at [17]).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Privy Council explained in <em>Haw Tua Tau</em> at [16] and [17], calling for the defence only brought proceedings to the next stage. The evaluation of the evidence was a task that still fell to be performed at the close of the trial. Until then, a Judge must keep an “open mind” as to the accuracy of the evidence of any of the witnesses until both sides have had a chance to present their case and to advance such submissions as they might wish. It was entirely possible, Chan CJ later explained in <em>Re Nalpon</em> at [25] that a trial court which had earlier found that there was a case to answer could – even if no evidence had been called for the defendant – eventually decide that the charge had not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt and that the accused should be acquitted.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60">60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having reviewed the evidence, I was satisfied that the evidence satisfied each and every element of the four charges.

It is well-established that in a case where no other evidence is available, a victim’s testimony can constitute proof beyond reasonable doubt (see s 136 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“EA”)) – but only when it is so “unusually convincing” as to overcome any doubts that might arise from the lack of corroboration: <em>AOF v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 3 SLR 0034.xml')">[2012] 3 SLR 34</a> at [111] and followed in <em>Public Prosecutor v GCK</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24365-SSP.xml')">[2020] 1 SLR 486</a> (“<em>GCK</em>”) at [89].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104">104&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply put, the uncorroborated testimony of a victim can sustain a conviction only if it is “unusually convincing”. The Court of Appeal (“the CA”) in <em>GCK</em> provided more insight to the “unusually convincing” standard:</a></p><a id="p1_104"> </a><p class="Judg-Quote-1"><a id="p1_104">90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put simply, the “unusually convincing” standard entails that the witness’s testimony <em>alone</em> is sufficient to prove the Prosecution’s case beyond a reasonable doubt: see <em>Teo Keng Pong v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1996] 2 SLR(R) 0890.xml')">[1996] 2 SLR(R) 890</a> at [73]. The overwhelming consideration that triggers the application of the standard is the <em>amount</em> and <em>availability</em> of evidence: see also <em>Kwan Peng Hong</em> ([72] <em>supra</em>) at [29].</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">91&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a sense, the “unusually convincing” standard is not a “test” at all but rather, a <em>heuristic tool</em>. It is a cautionary reminder to the court of the high threshold that the Prosecution must meet in order to secure a conviction, and of the anxious scrutiny that is required because of the severe consequences that will follow from a conviction. That scrutiny is directed towards the sufficiency of a witness’s testimony, which is inextricably linked to the ultimate inquiry of whether the case against the accused person has been proved by the Prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt: see <em>Mohammed Liton</em> at [39].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105">105&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summarising key legal principles, the CA in <em>GCK</em> further held:</a></p><a id="p1_105"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of proof beyond a reasonable doubt can be conceptualised in two ways. First, a reasonable doubt may arise from <em>within the case mounted by the Prosecution</em>. As part of its own case, the Prosecution must adduce sufficient evidence to establish the accused person’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on at least a <em>prima facie</em> basis. Failure to do so may lead to a finding that the Prosecution has failed to mount a case to answer, or to an acquittal. In those situations, the court must nevertheless particularise the specific weakness in the Prosecution’s own evidence that irrevocably lowers it below the threshold of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the court has identified the flaw internal to the Prosecution’s case, weaknesses in the Defence’s case cannot ordinarily shore up what is lacking in the Prosecution’s case to begin with because the Prosecution has simply not been able to discharge its overall legal burden.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second way in which a reasonable doubt may arise is on an assessment of the <em>totality of the evidence</em>. The inquiry here is intimately connected with the “unusually convincing” standard, which arises in the context of mutually exclusive and competing testimonies. The “unusually convincing” standard sets the threshold for a witness’s testimony to be preferred over the evidence put forth by the accused person where it is a case of one person’s word against another’s.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assessment of the Prosecution’s evidence under the “unusually convincing” standard must be made with regard to the <em>totality of the evidence</em>, which logically includes the case mounted by the Defence. The evaluative task is not just <em>internal</em> to the Prosecution’s case, but also <em>comparative</em> in nature. Where the evidential burden lies on the Defence and this has not been discharged, the court may find that the Prosecution has discharged its burden of proving its case against the accused person beyond a reasonable doubt. At this stage, regard may be had to weaknesses in the Defence’s case.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a><a id="p1_106">106&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing in mind the above principles, I turn now to my assessment and evaluation of the evidence.</a></p><a id="p1_106"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Accepting the First Victim’s evidence in respect of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Charges</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a><a id="p1_107">107&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my assessment, the First Victim gave her testimony in a clear and cogent manner.

The Accused was then standing on her right and facing her. This is consistent with her apprehension of the “bulge” that came into contact with her right thigh. She was unequivocally certain that it was Accused’s erect penis that had come into contact with her. I accept her evidence because this was the only logical conclusion from the evidence.</a></p><a id="p1_108"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a><a id="p1_109">109&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Charge, she was able to provide a detailed description of the sequence of events, including the fact that the Accused had changed his attire. The Accused was properly dressed when they went out for a walk. Certainly, the Accused would not want to be seen in his underwear walking outside the Unit. Upon their return from the walk, the Accused went to change and came out wearing a triangular underwear, which he later changed into a boxer. Protected by the privacy of his apartment, the Accused had pushed the boundaries of decency beyond what would have been normally acceptable. I found the First Victim’s explanation that she thought that this might probably be the lifestyle of a foreigner to be a reasonable one.</a></p><a id="p1_109"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a><a id="p1_110">110&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused claimed that the First Victim had defied his instructions by eating outside his grandmother’s room. He found that the First Victim could not properly bring his grandmother to urinate in the toilet. Despite these alleged dissatisfactions, he did not make any complaint against the First Victim to her agent or company. According to PW6, the Accused contacted her to engage another nurse to look after his grandmother and he had specifically asked for the First Victim to be assigned. In my assessment, the Accused had no issue with the First Victim. He was merely looking to find a basis to ascribe a motive to the First Victim for framing him with false allegations of outrage of modesty.</a></p><a id="p1_110"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a><a id="p1_111">111&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused made the argument that it was neither logical nor reasonable for the First Victim to remain at his Unit after being molested twice.

There was also the difficulty of finding a replacement at such late hours of the night. If she were to lodge a police report then, and the police were to come, there was the possibility of the Accused’s grandmother being left alone if she and the Accused had to leave the Unit to assist in the investigations. I found her reasoning to be credible and I accepted it. I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that the First Victim’s provision of consistent and rational explanations for her decision to stay despite her discomfort with the Accused’s conduct bolstered her credibility.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> I also agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions that the First Victim’s post incident behaviour was consistent with fear and shock arising out two incidents of outrage of modesty.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112">112&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of her shift, the First Victim reported the incidents to PW6 without any prompting (see Exhibit P11).

Other than the two incidents of outrage of her modesty, the Second Victim testified to the Accused sniffing at his grandmother’s private area. The Accused did not challenge the Second Victim on this aspect of her testimony. In his investigations (see Exhibit P16), the following was recorded:</a></p><a id="p1_114"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you put your face close to your grandmother’s vagina?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do that regularly.

The Accused’s evidence was materially different from his statement (see [77] above, referring to Q11/A11 in Exhibit P16).

If the prosecution witnesses’ evidence was unchallenged by him, and that evidence is not illogical or inherently incredible, then the Court would have no grounds to reject the prosecution witnesses’ evidence. The Accused claimed that the victims were lying. At some point in time, he felt that it was pointless to continue to question them.

Hence, it was important for him to narrate his versions of the event. This was explained to him several times during the trial. Despite the explanation, the Accused maintained his defiance. At one stage of his cross-examination, the Accused had the audacity to say:</a></p><a id="p1_130"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, even after it was specifically told to you, it’s not about the charge, it’s about what happened that night, you didn’t mention it.</p> </a><p class="Judg-Quote-1"><a id="p1_130">A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t tell you about the weather that night.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131">131&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, I found the Accused giving different accounts at different stages.

Exhibit P16 was read to him on completion and he was then given the opportunity to make amendments but he chose not to. This indicated that he had accepted the contents of the statement.

General deterrence is applicable where there is a pressing need to educate and deter other like-minded members of the general public by making an example of the particular offender: <em>Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 2 SLR(R) 0814.xml')">[2007] 2 SLR(R) 814</a> (“<em>Law Aik Meng</em>”) at [24]. General deterrence is applicable when the offender commits sexual exploitation of his victims in a setting where the victims are taken advantage of in the course of their work such as in the present case. Furthermore, the public disquiet about sexual offences and the difficulty of detection of the offender’s offences are key factors that calls for general deterrence: <em>Law Aik Meng</em> at [25(c)] and [25(d)].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139">139&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific deterrence is applicable in the present case as the Accused was a brazen offender who committed the sexual offences against two victims in quick succession. The Accused was unremorseful for his transgressions. Specific deterrence dictates that unremorseful offenders are to be punished more severely: <em>Thong Sing Hock v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2009] 3 SLR(R) 0047.xml')">[2009] 3 SLR(R) 47</a> (“<em>Thong Sing</em> Hock”) at [59].</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Offence-specific and Offender-specific factors</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140">140&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution highlighted the following offence-specific factors:</a></p><a id="p1_140"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_140"></a><a id="p1_140-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused used his penis to touch the victims in respect of the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> Charges. The touches were more than fleeting. In respect of these three charges, the victims reported that the touches lasted a few seconds each time. In respect of the 4<sup>th</sup> Charge, the Accused used his hand to touch the Second Victim’s buttocks. The contact was a forceful one. The Prosecution thus submitted that there was a moderate degree of sexual exploitation.</a></p><a id="p1_140-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_140-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_140-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victims were at the Accused’s place to look after his elderly and bedridden grandmother. The Accused had exploited the victims whilst they were performing their duties. The Accused had therefore abused the victims’ trust when he outraged their modesty. The Accused’s offending conduct forced the victims into making a difficult decision of either staying to see through their professional commitment to look after the Accused’s grandmother or to the leave the premises for their personal safety. The First Victim chose to remain. The Second Victim decided to leave immediately. The different decisions of the victims demonstrated the dilemma the Accused’s transgression had put them through. The Prosecution submitted that a deterrent sentence is necessary to send a message that such exploitative behaviour is intolerable. A deterrent sentence is also needed to protect private nurses like the victims from suffering such harm.</a></p><a id="p1_140-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_140-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_140-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victims were defenceless when the Accused perpetrated the offending acts against them in his home where there was no one to witness the offending or to help them.

For the Second Victim, the Accused used his penis to touch the Second Victim’s buttocks on the first incident. The Accused then used his hand to touch the Second Victim’s buttocks during the second incident.

This alone takes the offending act outside of Band 1. That said, the District Judge expressly found at [73] of the GD ([5] <em>supra</em>) that the duration of the contact was “brief”. The contact was in the nature of a “brush” and made “in one motion” (GD at [73]). The action was taken at a “slow/normal speed” (at [19]), and there was no skin-on-skin contact (at [73]). The degree of sexual exploitation therefore suggests that the act falls within the lower end of Band 2.”</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_147">147&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, the Defence relied on <em>Thompson, Matthew</em> at [66] to argue that the brief nature of the contact points towards a lower sentence than that proposed by the Prosecution.</a></p><a id="p1_147"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a><a id="p1_148">148&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Defence submitted that consecutive sentencing should apply only to two out of the four charges. The Defence submitted that the sentences of imprisonment for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Charges should run consecutively, with the other sentences to run concurrently. In the circumstances, the Defence sought a global sentence of not more than 4.5 months’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_148"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Court’s Decision on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Applying Kunasekaran</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a><a id="p1_149">149&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agreed with both the Prosecution and Defence that the offending acts fell into Band 1 of <em>Kunasekaran</em> sentencing framework.</a></p><a id="p1_149"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a><a id="p1_150">150&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that the sentencing principles of general and specific deterrence were applicable to this case. I also agreed with all but one of the Prosecution’s submissions on the offence-specific and offender-specific factors applicable to this. I disagreed with the Prosecution’s submission regarding the weight to be placed on the duration of the physical contact. The evidence, as pointed out by the Defence, showed that the duration of the contact was not more than five seconds on each occasion. In my assessment, the Prosecution has put excessive weight on this factor.</a></p><a id="p1_150"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a><a id="p1_151">151&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the Defence’s plea-in-mitigation, I found that the Accused was not a first-time offender given that he had committed three more offences after the 1<sup>st</sup> Charge. The fact that he had claimed trial was a neutral factor. A sentencing discount that is often given to an offender who has elected to plead guilty would not apply to the Accused. I also found that the Defence had placed excessive weight to the Accused’s personal and familial circumstances. It is well settled that, except in most exceptional circumstances, hardship to the offender’s family has very little, if any mitigating value: <em>Lai Oei Mui Jenny v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1993] 2 SLR(R) 0406.xml')">[1993] 2 SLR(R) 406</a>. I did not find the Accused’s personal and family circumstances to be any different from other cases. This was plainly not an exceptional case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152">152&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my judgment, the appropriate individual sentence for 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Charges lies somewhere between the sentences proposed by the Prosecution and the Defence. It was my assessment that a sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment each for the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Charges would be adequate punishment on the facts of this case.</a></p><a id="p1_152"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a><a id="p1_153">153&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my assessment, the 4<sup>th</sup> Charge is less egregious than the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Charges. This was also the respective positions of the Prosecution and Defence for they have each set a lower sentence in respect of the 4<sup>th</sup> Charge. In my judgment, a sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment would be adequate punishment for the 4<sup>th</sup> Charge.</a></p><a id="p1_153"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Global Sentence and Totality Principle</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a><a id="p1_154">154&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having established the individual sentence for each charge, I then proceeded to consider the appropriate total sentence for this case. In this regard, the Accused’s overall criminality should be reflected in the global sentence. I was also mindful of the applicability of s 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (2010 Rev Ed.)</a></p><a id="p1_154"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a><a id="p1_155">155&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was clear to the Court that the sentence of imprisonment involving the two victims should run consecutively. First, these were separate and unrelated offences involving different victims. Second, the two offences were committed on different occasions. The general rule of consecutive sentencing therefore applied in this case: <em>Public Prosecutor v Raveen Balakrishnan</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22604-SSP.xml')">[2018] 5 SLR 799</a> at [98(b)] (“<em>Raveen</em>”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156">156&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution and the Defence submitted for only two out of the four sentences of imprisonment to run consecutively.

The Accused gave his evidence-in-chief on 26 January 2021 (<em>ie</em> Day 6 of the trial). At the end of the Accused’s evidence-in-chief, the trial was adjourned and was scheduled to resume on 11 May 2021 whereby the Prosecution was slated to commence their cross examination of the Accused. Between 27 January 2021 to 10 May 2021, the Accused made two attempts to reach out to me. The first occasion was on 26 April 2021 where the Accused sent an email to the State Courts’ general registry requesting, <em>inter alia</em>, for my email address. It was his intention to speak to me privately, suggesting that the mode of communication could be via email. I gave instructions to my registry staff that my email address must not be released to the Accused. Nonetheless, the Accused managed to get my email address. This brings us to the second occasion which was on 4 May 2021. Accused sent an email to me on 4 May 2021. In his email, he requested that I review, acquit and dismiss his case. I did not reply to his email. In both instances, I did not communicate with the Accused.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a> In fact, other than dealing with the Accused in open court throughout the course of the trial, I did not have any other form of communication, directly or indirectly, with the Accused. The Accused’s actions in attempting to contact me were certainly improper. Be that as it may, I disregarded these two episodes when I deliberated and assessed the evidence adduced in this trial. In arriving at my decision to convict the Accused, I had decided the case purely on the strength of the evidence adduced by the Prosecution.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>See Exhibit P12 and Exhibit P13.
