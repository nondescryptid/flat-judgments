Each bond was in the sum of $150,000, meaning that the total bail amount was $300,000. The first bond had been executed to secure the accused’s release on bail. The second bond had been executed to enable the accused to leave Singapore while on bail – I had granted him permission to leave Singapore between hearing dates in a long-running joint trial before me of the accused and another co-accused (“the trial”), subject to the condition that the further bond be executed.</a></p><a id="p1_1"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having left Singapore pursuant to the permission granted, the accused subsequently failed to return to Singapore and attend court for his trial. He claimed through his counsel Mr&nbsp;Rakesh s/o Pokkan Vasu that he was unable to return to Singapore because he was medically unfit to travel from his present location in south India to Singapore. At first the relevant medical diagnosis was a kidney infection, but later it became deep vein thrombosis (“DVT”). I considered the medical evidence that the accused furnished progressively through Mr&nbsp;Rakesh, but did not think that this evidence sufficed to show that the medical diagnoses, individually or collectively, prevented the accused from traveling to Singapore. Thus I held that the accused did not have any justification or excuse for his failure to return to Singapore and attend court for the trial, and so I revoked his bail and issued a warrant for his arrest.</a></p><a id="p1_2"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the accused’s default I called upon the surety to explain why the two bonds he had executed should not be forfeited. Having heard the surety’s explanations I decided to forfeit the whole of the amounts of both bonds. The surety has filed two appeals against my decision, one for each bond, and so I set out now in writing the reasons for my decision in respect of both bonds.</a></p><a id="p1_3"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is useful to state at the outset that the surety’s explanations were largely, if not wholly, built on the premise that the accused was medically unable to return to Singapore. This was the premise I had repeatedly rejected in deciding in the first place to revoke the accused’s bail and issue a warrant of arrest against him. It is therefore necessary to explain in detail why I rejected that premise in spite of the medical evidence that the accused put forward.</a></p><a id="p1_4"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The accused’s absence from the trial</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 30&nbsp;September 2022, which was the last day of a tranche of the trial that had started two weeks before, the prosecution closed its case and I called on both the accused and his co-accused to give their defences. The next hearing dates for the trial had been fixed in November 2022, specifically, 7 to 11&nbsp;and 23 to 26&nbsp;November 2022. On the accused’s application I granted him permission in the meantime to leave Singapore on bail from 1&nbsp;October to 5&nbsp;November 2022. The prosecution had not objected to the accused’s application, and I granted permission on the basis that the accused needed to work in Cambodia, India and Malaysia during that period.</a></p><a id="p1_5"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The accused’s kidney infection</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the trial resumed on 7&nbsp;November 2022 the accused was not present in court. Mr&nbsp;Rakesh informed me that the accused was still in India and that he was instructed that the accused was medically unfit to return to Singapore. Mr&nbsp;Rakesh showed me two medical documents. One was a handwritten note by Dr&nbsp;T Rajendran (“Dr&nbsp;Rajendran”) dated 2&nbsp;November 2022. The typewritten letterhead on the note bore the logo of AKC Nursing Home and stated an address in Thanjavur, India, and identified Dr&nbsp;Rajendran as “Consultant Nephrologist &amp; Transplant Physician”. The note was titled “Medical certificate” and went on to state that the accused was suffering from “obesity” and “Acute Pyelonephritis” and needed “bedrest and IV Antibiotics for nearly 2 weeks so he can’t travel till fourth week of Nov. 22”. The other medical document was a typewritten report by Dr&nbsp;Vasuki Ganesan, also dated 2&nbsp;November 2022, on the letterhead of Babas Scans, described as a provider of “ULTRA SONOGRAPHY &amp; COLOUR DOPPLER SERVICES”. This report recorded an impression of “Left pyelonephitis [<em>sic</em>]” based on an ultrasound of the accused’s abdomen.</a></p><a id="p1_6"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that the medical documents did not suffice to show that the accused was unable to return to Singapore. I accepted that the accused had acute left pyelonephritis, which I understood to mean an infection of his left kidney, but I could not see how this was preventing him from returning to Singapore. Even if he needed bedrest and intravenously administered antibiotics, as Dr&nbsp;Rajendran said he did, I did not see why he could not take a flight from India to Singapore and thereafter receive treatment in Singapore. Nonetheless, given the unavoidable fact of the accused’s absence, I could not proceed with the trial, and so I adjourned the proceedings to the morning of the next day and extended the accused’s bail.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morning of 8&nbsp;November 2022, Mr&nbsp;Rakesh’s colleague informed me that the accused was still in India and would be seeing a doctor in the afternoon. Once more I could not proceed with the trial and so adjourned the proceedings to the morning of the next day and extended the accused’s bail.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 9&nbsp;November 2022, Mr&nbsp;Rakesh’s colleague informed me that the accused was still in India and produced a further medical document. This was another handwritten note from Dr&nbsp;Rajendran on the same typewritten letterhead of AKC Nursing Home. The note was titled “Medical certificate (supplement)”. It stated that, “[i]n view of ‘Acute Pyelonephritis’ with the background of obesity / Diabetes Mellitus”, the accused “needs to have Intravenous injection &amp; Antibiotics with bed rest for at least 2 weeks” and “strict control of blood sugar also – so he needs to be tested blood sugar level on &amp; off”. According to the note, these reasons were “self-explanatory why he can’t travel now at least for 2 weeks”. The note added that the accused was “having fever on &amp; off and he can’t sit for many hours”.</a></p><a id="p1_9"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that even taking into account this additional note from Dr&nbsp;Rajendran there was insufficient basis to find that the accused was unable to return to Singapore for medical reasons. There was no evidence of any risk of irreparable harm to the accused if he were to fly back to Singapore, and I could not see any reason why it would be impossible or impracticable for him to do so. It appeared that no consideration had been given to the question of whether accommodation could be made for his circumstances – for instance, giving him an injection shortly before the flight and having him fly in a class that would enable him to lie down in his seat, and then proceeding immediately after landing in Singapore to a medical institution for another injection. That being so, it seemed to me that the accused’s health would at most make it merely inconvenient for him to return to Singapore, and would not render him genuinely unable to do so.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though this meant that the accused had no valid reason for his absence from the trial, I took up the prosecution’s very fair and reasonable suggestion that I could give the accused one final opportunity to return to Singapore instead of revoking his bail immediately. I extended the accused’s bail, as well as the grant of permission for him to leave Singapore, to 14&nbsp;November 2022, meaning that he would have at least five calendar days, including the weekend, to return to Singapore. I fixed a hearing in the morning of 15&nbsp;November 2022 for an update on the accused’s whereabouts.</a></p><a id="p1_11"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The accused’s deep vein thrombosis</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 15&nbsp;November 2022, the accused continued to be absent. Mr&nbsp;Rakesh maintained that the accused was medically unfit to return to Singapore, but this time the medical reason given was not a kidney infection but DVT. In support of this Mr&nbsp;Rakesh submitted two new medical documents. One was a typewritten medical certificate dated 10 November 2022 signed by Dr&nbsp;M&nbsp;Anguraj (“Dr&nbsp;Anguraj”), consultant neurologist at Navin Neuro Care Centre located in Thanjavur. Dr&nbsp;Anguraj explained that the accused had been referred to him with “swelling and throbbing pain in the calf and thigh area of the left leg”, and that a “venous Doppler study” of the accused’s left leg revealed DVT, which was a “medical condition that occurs when a blood clot forms in a deep vein”. For this the accused had been “prescribed anticoagulant medicine warfarin for 3 months”. Dr&nbsp;Anguraj then opined that the accused was “unfit travel [<em>sic</em>] long distance and air travel for a minimum period of 8 weeks till 05/01/2023”. Dr&nbsp;Anguraj elaborated:</a></p><a id="p1_12"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">As High altitudes and low cabin air pressure lead to physiological changes that may predispose to venous thromboembolisms (VTE) including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). He is obese with uncontrolled diabetes and blood pressure which put him on high risk to occur Pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs when a blood clot gets stuck in an artery in the lung, blocking blood flow to part of the lung. This condition is detrimental to health and life.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other new medical document was a typewritten medical certificate dated 11&nbsp;November 2022 signed by Dr&nbsp;V&nbsp;Jayavel (“Dr&nbsp;Jayavel”). From the letterhead it appeared that this certificate was issued by Refresh Hospital located in Chennai, India. The certificate essentially echoed the views of Dr&nbsp;Anguraj: it stated that the accused had been diagnosed with DVT and that “HE IS UNFIT TO TRAVEL LONG DISTANCE AND AIR TRAVEL FOR A MINIMUM PERIOD OF 8 WEEKS”. There was no explanation or elaboration beyond this and so I did not think it added anything to Dr&nbsp;Anguraj’s views.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I did not doubt that the accused had DVT, I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that the medical evidence did not show that the result of the accused’s DVT was that he was unable to travel to Singapore. The starting point was that the accused should have returned to Singapore by 5&nbsp;November 2022 but failed to do so, and the onus was on him to provide some justification or excuse for his absence. I considered that the accused needed to demonstrate that it was truly impossible or at least impracticable for him to return to Singapore. I thought that it was right to require the accused to meet this high threshold given the strong public interest in ensuring that persons alleged to have contravened Singapore’s criminal laws stand trial to have the question of their guilt or innocence determined.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the strength of Dr&nbsp;Anguraj’s medical certificate I was prepared to accept that a pulmonary embolism (“PE”) is a dangerous condition that is “detrimental to health and life”. But this characterisation was not extended to DVT, which was what the accused actually had. All Dr&nbsp;Anguraj said about DVT was that the high altitudes and low cabin air pressure inherent in air travel would lead to “physiological changes” that may “predispose” a traveller to developing DVT. If the DVT-specific danger of air travel is only that it increases the risk of getting DVT, I could not see how this was relevant to the accused’s situation because the fact was that the accused already had DVT. It was not suggested that air travel might exacerbate existing DVT or cause it to become more harmful. Hence I could not see how the accused’s DVT would prevent him from traveling by air.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While PE might be a truly dangerous condition and air travel might predispose a traveller to developing PE, I could not see how all this was relevant to the accused’s situation because the medical evidence did not suggest any connection between DVT and PE. It was not suggested, for instance, that DVT might increase the risk of getting PE. Rather, it appeared from Dr&nbsp;Anguraj’s opinion that the “high risk” of PE arose from the accused’s obesity, uncontrolled diabetes and blood pressure. But these were all health issues that the accused had had all along, and it had never been suggested that he should not travel by air as a consequence. If the accused had been able to leave Singapore by air to begin with notwithstanding these health issues, I could not understand how the same health issues would prevent him from flying back to Singapore.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons I did not think that the medical evidence established that the accused’s latest diagnosis of DVT made it hazardous or risky, let alone impossible or impracticable, for him to return to Singapore by air. Moreover, it seemed to me that the accused was prepared to act contrary to medical advice if it suited his interests to do so. From the fact that the accused consulted Dr&nbsp;Anguraj in Thanjavur on 10&nbsp;November 2022 and visited Refresh Hospital in Chennai on 11&nbsp;November 2022, it was apparent that he had undertaken a journey from Thanjavur to Chennai, which I understood to be more than 300km apart, even though Dr&nbsp;Anguraj’s opinion was that the accused was unfit to travel “long distance” in addition to being unfit for air travel. While the meaning of “long distance” might be relative it seemed to me that a distance of more than 300km, which would take at least four or five hours to traverse on land, was no doubt a long distance. The likely travel time of four or five hours was after all not far off from the duration of a flight from south India to Singapore which the accused claimed to be unable to take.</a></p><a id="p1_17"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After taking the accused’s instructions Mr&nbsp;Rakesh confirmed that the accused had travelled by road from Thanjavur to Chennai, but explained that the accused had taken frequent breaks along the way. I did not think that this explanation assisted the accused. If anything, I thought it meant that it was entirely possible for the accused to travel by air with appropriate measures in place to minimise any associated risk.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only plausible inference I could draw in all the circumstances was that the accused was simply unwilling to return to Singapore for the trial. This could not begin to justify or excuse his absence from the trial, and so I revoked his bail and issued a warrant for his arrest.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties requested that they be given some time to consider how the trial should proceed against the co-accused in the accused’s absence, and so I adjourned the proceedings to the morning of 23&nbsp;November 2022. I asked that the parties provide at that hearing an update as to the accused’s whereabouts and intentions, and I also directed that the surety attend that hearing to explain why the bonds he had executed should not be forfeited.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The accused’s unsuccessful attempts to reverse revocation of his bail</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 23&nbsp;November 2022 the accused continued to be absent. Mr&nbsp;Rakesh showed me two more medical documents and submitted that I should reconsider and thereupon reverse my decision to revoke the accused’s bail and issue a warrant for his arrest. One of the documents was a typewritten medical certificate dated 15&nbsp;November 2022 on the letterhead of Refresh Hospital and signed by Dr&nbsp;Jayavel. This certificate reiterated Dr&nbsp;Jayavel’s view in the medical certificate dated 11&nbsp;November 2022 that the accused was unfit for air travel and long-distance travel for at least eight weeks, and added that the reason for such unfitness was that air travel and long-distance travel “MIGHT CAUSE HARM TO HIS HEALTH &amp; LIFE”. The other medical document was a typewritten report dated 15&nbsp;November 2022 on the letterhead of Avanthika Scans signed by Dr&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Ramkumar, a consultant radiologist. This report was titled “LEFT LOWER LIMB VENOUS DOPPLER STUDY” and recorded an impression of “[c]hronic thrombosis of left external iliac vein, left femoral vein and superficial femoral vein”.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not think that these new medical documents provided any cause for me to revisit my decision to revoke the accused’s bail and issue a warrant of arrest. The report from Avanthika Scans did no more than state the uncontroversial fact that the accused had DVT, and so was not probative of the question of whether the DVT made it impossible or impracticable for the accused to return to Singapore. As for Dr&nbsp;Jayavel’s latest medical certificate, I did not think it right to place any substantial weight on the bare assertion that air travel might cause harm to the accused’s health and life in the complete absence of any elaboration on that point, especially given that I had already found insufficient the more detailed explanation provided by Dr&nbsp;Anguraj in his medical certificate dated 10&nbsp;November 2022.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surety was in attendance at the hearing on 23&nbsp;November 2022 and was represented at the time by Mr&nbsp;Rakesh. Through Mr&nbsp;Rakesh the surety indicated his intention to travel to India to look for the accused. I adjourned the proceedings to 14&nbsp;December 2022 to give the surety time to do so.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 14&nbsp;December 2022 the accused continued to be absent. Mr&nbsp;Rakesh showed me yet another new medical document and again submitted that I should revisit and thereupon reverse my decision to revoke the accused’s bail and issue a warrant of arrest. This new medical document was a typewritten discharge summary dated 23&nbsp;November 2022 on the letterhead of Padmini Nursing Home and signed by an unnamed duty medical officer. I assumed that the “DR.JAYAVEL” named therein as one of the accused’s medical consultants was the same Dr&nbsp;Jayavel who had signed the typewritten reports dated 11 and 15&nbsp;November 2022. It appeared from the discharge summary that the accused had been admitted to Padmini Nursing Home on 19&nbsp;November 2022 and had been discharged on 23&nbsp;November 2022. According to the summary, during his stay the accused was “Treated with Conservative Medical Management” and his “condi[ti]on Improved gradually”, but nonetheless he was advised that he was “Unfit for Long Distance travel and Air Travel For A Minimum Period Of 2 Months, As it will Cause Harm to His health and Life”. The summary also referred to an anticipated “Review after 1 week with PT INR Report”.</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once more I declined the invitation to reconsider my decision to revoke the accused’s bail and issue a warrant for his arrest. I did not think that the latest medical document made any material difference. The relevant portion of the discharge summary from Padmini Nursing Home was the advice that the accused was unfit for air travel for a minimum of two months, the stated basis being that this would cause harm to his health and life. But this was nothing more than a reiteration of the opinions of Dr&nbsp;Anguraj and Dr&nbsp;Jayavel that I had already found to be unsatisfactory. Like Dr&nbsp;Jayavel’s medical certificate dated 15 November 2022, this discharge summary contained only a bare assertion and lacked any analysis as to how and why the accused’s DVT would or would likely cause harm to his health if he were to travel by air. I thought that this fell far short of the high threshold the accused had to meet to demonstrate an excuse for his absence from Singapore and from the trial.</a></p><a id="p1_25"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agreed with the prosecution’s two specific criticisms of this latest medical evidence. One was that the discharge summary effectively lengthened without any justification the period for which the accused was allegedly unfit for air travel. Given that Dr&nbsp;Jayavel’s medical certificate dated 15&nbsp;November 2022 stated a minimum period of eight weeks, one might reasonably expect that a medical document prepared one week later would stipulate a minimum period of seven weeks, or provide some reason why the period had been extended. But the discharge summary dated 23&nbsp;November 2022 stated a minimum period of two months, which was even longer than eight weeks, yet furnished no reason at all for the extension. The other criticism was that even though the discharge summary alluded to an expected review one week later there was no evidence that any such review had been carried out. I thought that if the accused wished to furnish a medical excuse for his absence it was incumbent on him to go for regular reviews at the very least, in order that his condition might be reassessed and appropriate adjustments might be made to the estimated period for which he was allegedly unable to travel by air. These two inadequacies in the medical evidence strengthened my impression that the accused had no real intention of returning to Singapore and was simply trying to delay facing the legal consequences of his absence.</a></p><a id="p1_26"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The proceedings against the surety</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned above, the surety first attended court on 23&nbsp;November 2022, and I adjourned the proceedings to 14&nbsp;December 2022 to give him time to carry out his intention to travel to India to look for the accused.</a></p><a id="p1_27"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 14&nbsp;December 2022, Mr&nbsp;Rakesh explained that the surety had gone to Chennai on 9&nbsp;December 2022 and had managed to visit the accused there before returning to Singapore on 10 December 2022. In addition to the discharge summary from Padmini Nursing Home, Mr&nbsp;Rakesh handed up several photographs that the surety had taken of the accused resting in bed in Chennai wearing what appeared to be a compression leg sleeve around his left knee and calf. Mr&nbsp;Rakesh submitted that the surety had done the very best he could in traveling to Chennai to check on the accused. He contended that the discharge summary showed that the accused was truly medically unfit to travel by air, and that it was physically impossible for the surety to drag the accused onto a flight back to Singapore, and that the surety could not reasonably be expected to override the accused’s will and somehow force the accused to get out of bed and walk and board a flight to Singapore. Mr&nbsp;Rakesh asked rhetorically what more the surety could possibly do given the circumstances.</a></p><a id="p1_28"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I informed the parties that I did not agree with the surety’s argument that there was nothing more that he could have done, and that on the material placed before me I did not think that the surety had shown cause for non-forfeiture of the bonds. Mr&nbsp;Rakesh sought another adjournment of the proceedings so that the surety could make further endeavours towards discharging his duties, and the prosecution did not object to giving the surety one last opportunity in this regard. Accordingly I granted the surety a final adjournment of the proceedings to 6&nbsp;January 2023.</a></p><a id="p1_29"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 6&nbsp;January 2023 the accused continued to be absent. At the commencement of the hearing Mr&nbsp;Rakesh applied to be discharged from acting for the surety. The surety did not object and I granted the application.</a></p><a id="p1_30"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surety proceeded to explain that he had planned to travel to India on 2&nbsp;January 2023 to meet the accused’s doctors but eventually did not do so because the doctor he had planned to see, Dr&nbsp;Davidson – who was identified in the discharge summary from Padmini Nursing Home as the accused’s primary consultant – extended his leave until 15&nbsp;January 2023. He said that he had kept in contact with the accused, in that he had checked on the accused’s health and when the accused would be able to return to Singapore. The surety added that he had also asked about the possibility of transporting the accused back to Singapore by way of an emergency airlift, in that he had contacted a company called Air Rescuers Worldwide, but the company quoted a price of US$63,000 for the service and he could not afford it. He said that he tried to see if there were any ways of bringing the accused back to Singapore, but the accused’s leg was in a very bad state and there was nothing more that he – the surety – could do having regard to the accused’s health.</a></p><a id="p1_31"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">My assessment of the surety’s explanations</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking guidance from the High Court decision of <em>Cher Ting Ting v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20380-SSP.xml')">[2017] 3 SLR 1009</a> (“<em>Cher Ting Ting</em>”) at [28], the first question I had to answer was whether the surety had exercised reasonable due diligence in the discharge of his duties. The essence of the surety’s explanations was that the accused was medically unfit to return to Singapore, and that in such circumstances he did all he could have done by traveling to Chennai to check on the accused, and there was nothing more that he could reasonably have done because it would be unrealistic and unfair to expect him to force the accused to travel to Singapore in spite of his medical condition and against medical advice.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin with, the surety’s explanations were confined to the steps that he took after the accused failed to return to Singapore and attend court for the trial on 7&nbsp;November 2022. The surety did not explain at all how he had discharged his duties prior to the accused’s failure. Nonetheless, even assuming – as I was prepared to do – that if the surety could prove that there was truly nothing more that he could have done following the accused’s failure to return to Singapore and attend court this would amount to reasonable due diligence on his part, I thought that the surety fell far short of proving this.</a></p><a id="p1_33"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have explained above why I repeatedly rejected the accused’s claim that he was medically unable to undertake a journey from south India to Singapore. Given this context, I expected the surety to act on the basis that the accused was capable of returning to Singapore. On that basis, it seemed to me that reasonable due diligence would, at the very least, require the surety to investigate thoroughly the extent of the accused’s DVT and explore all measures to mitigate any risk to the accused’s health that would arise from traveling back to Singapore. To put it bluntly, I expected the surety to move heaven and earth to obtain a medically sound plan to transport the accused back to Singapore, or failing that, clear and reliable medical evidence that transporting the accused was impossible or so extremely risky as to be impracticable.</a></p><a id="p1_34"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I had explained at the hearing on 14&nbsp;December 2022, I could think of various things that the surety could do. He could accompany medical doctors to see the accused and impress on the doctors that the starting point is that the accused must return to Singapore, so that the question is not whether the accused is fit to travel – which had been the accused’s focus thus far in seeking medical advice – but what can practically be done to facilitate the accused’s travel despite his medical diagnoses. The surety could make his own inquiries as to how patients with DVT can nonetheless be transported safely by air, including the possibility of travel in business class, which would allow the patient to lie down with legs fully extended. He could make these inquiries with airlines or medical institutions or service providers with expertise in emergency air evacuations. All this might involve considerable time and expense, but given the strong public interest in getting the accused back to Singapore for the trial I thought that reasonable due diligence could require the surety to expend significant time and money in discharging his duties. I did not think it sufficed for him just to travel to India for a day to see the accused, which was all that he had done prior to 14&nbsp;December 2022. To hold that this was sufficient diligence would mean that the surety could avoid forfeiture of $300,000 simply by purchasing a return air ticket for, say, $1,000, which could not be right.</a></p><a id="p1_35"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that the surety’s efforts between the hearings on 14&nbsp;December 2022 and 6&nbsp;January 2023 were woefully inadequate. His stated intention to see Dr&nbsp;Davidson in India was meaningless given that he did not carry it out. I saw no reason why he could not have engaged and accompanied another medical doctor to evaluate the accused for the purpose of formulating an air travel plan. According to the prosecution, the accused informed the investigation officer shortly before the hearing on 6&nbsp;January 2023 that he was following up with Dr&nbsp;Anguraj. Leaving aside the point that this suggested that the accused was even then continuing to travel from his residence in Chennai to Dr&nbsp;Anguraj’s clinic in Thanjavur more than 300km away despite medical advice that he was unfit to travel long distances, I did not see why the surety could not have consulted Dr&nbsp;Anguraj, or for that matter Dr&nbsp;Jayavel.</a></p><a id="p1_36"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the surety’s inquiries with Air Rescuers Worldwide, I agreed with the prosecution that it was not enough to obtain a single quote for emergency airlift and then go no further. Even accepting that the single quote of US$63,000 – which was less than S$100,000 – represented the likely actual cost of evacuating the accused to Singapore, I disagreed with the surety’s argument that it was unreasonable to expect him to pay such a sum. The surety stood to lose up to $300,000 if the bonds were forfeited, and in the event of full forfeiture would have to cough up $150,000 in cash in addition to the $150,000 he had already set aside as monetary security, and so I did not see why the economics of the situation made it prohibitive or otherwise unfeasible for the surety to pay US$63,000 if that would enable the accused to return to Singapore.</a></p><a id="p1_37"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the half-hearted nature of the steps taken by the surety after the accused’s failure to return to Singapore, I found that the surety had adopted a highly lackadaisical attitude towards his duties. He seemed content to accept unquestioningly the premise that the accused was medically unfit to travel to Singapore even though I had made it abundantly clear that I rejected this premise. He seemed to me essentially indifferent as to whether the accused returned to Singapore for the trial. The only conclusion open to me was that the surety had not exercised reasonable due diligence and so had not shown cause for non-forfeiture of the bonds that he had executed.</a></p><a id="p1_38"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the High Court held in <em>Cher Ting Ting</em> at [41], where the surety has failed to show cause for non-forfeiture the starting point is forfeiture of the whole of the bonds, unless the surety can show exceptional circumstances warranting a departure from that starting point. On the facts before me I could perceive no mitigating circumstances, let alone exceptional ones. Accordingly I forfeited the whole of the amounts of both bonds that the surety had executed.</a></p><a id="p1_39"> </a></div></content></html>
