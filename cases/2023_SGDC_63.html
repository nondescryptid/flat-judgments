This is clear from the wording of s 304(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) itself … which states that the court shall sentence the accused to preventive detention if the court is satisfied that “it is expedient for the protection of the public”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal in <em>PP v Rosli Bin Yassin</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 2 SLR 0831.xml')">[2013] 2 SLR 831</a> (“<em>Rosli</em>”) at [11] observed that:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The overarching principle is the need <em>to protect the public</em> … Put simply, if the individual offender is such a habitual offender whose situation does not admit of the possibility of his or her reform, thus constituting a menace to the public (and this would include, but is not limited to, offences involving violence), a sentence of preventive detention would be imposed on him or her for a substantial period of time in order to protect the public. As Yong Pung How CJ put it in the Singapore High Court decision of <em>PP v Wong Wing Hung</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1999] 3 SLR(R) 0304.xml')">[1999] 3 SLR(R) 304</a> (“<em>Wong Wing Hung</em>”) at [10], the “sentence [of preventive detention] is meant essentially for <em>habitual</em> offenders, who must be over the age of 30 years, whom the court considers to be <em>beyond redemption and too recalcitrant for reformation</em>”. The court will look at the <em>totality</em> of the offender’s previous convictions. (see the Singapore High Court decision of <em>Tan Ngin Hai v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2001] 2 SLR(R) 0152.xml')">[2001] 2 SLR(R) 152</a> at [7]).

In its assessment, the court will have regard to the totality of the offender’s previous convictions viewed together with the circumstances of the offender’s present offending.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Importantly, since a sentence of PD is underpinned by the need to protect the public, it differs from a sentence of imprisonment and different considerations may apply in determining the appropriate duration and implementation of the sentence. As Yong CJ explained in <em>Public Prosecutor v Perumal s/o Suppiah</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2000] 2 SLR(R) 0145.xml')">[2000] 2 SLR(R) 145</a> at [38]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">In this regard, I must reiterate my earlier exhortation in <em>PP v Wong Wing Hung</em> … at [10] not to confuse the concept of preventive detention and imprisonment, which are distinct sentences and are underpinned by different objectives and rationales. The former is essentially aimed at the protection of the public while the latter reflects the traditional policies of prevention, deterrence, rehabilitation and retribution. They are different in duration, character and implementation. As such, it would be a mistake to view them as fungible sentences.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The need to protect the public</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not disputed that the technical requirements under s.304(2)(a) CPC for the imposition of PD were satisfied in the present case. Both parties also accepted the findings of the PSR without challenge. Therefore, the key issue was whether it was expedient for the protection of the public for a sentence of PD to be imposed on the accused, as opposed to a regular term of imprisonment: <em>Sim Yeow Kee v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/19466-SSP.xml')">[2016] SGHC 209</a> (at [107])</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, there is a real need to protect the public against future re-offending by the accused such that a sentence of preventive detention should be imposed. In arriving at this conclusion, I had regard to the findings of the PSR and considered the accused’s history of offending, the circumstances of the present offences, and the risk of future re-offending.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">History of offending</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused’s criminal history spanning over 30 years spoke for itself. Three conclusions can be drawn.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_20-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, from the accused’s long list of antecedents starting from 1988, there was no doubt that the accused was a habitual offender. The PSR noted that the accused committed his first offence at the age of 11 years old and at age 13, he was sentenced to two-year probation for the offence of Robbery with hurt under s.394 PC. Since then, the accused has been charged with new offences and was ordered to stay at the Singapore Boy’s home and had gone through multiple incarcerations including Reformative Training and two stints of Corrective Training of 8 and 10 years respectively. The history of offending behaviours included drug consumption, violence, theft, cheating, forgery, driving a motor vehicle without license, house-breaking and fraudulent possession of property. The latest set of offences related to committing harassment on behalf of unlicenced moneylenders, repeat offending for driving a motor vehicle without license, and cheating.</a></p><a id="p1_20-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_20-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the accused demonstrated a propensity to resort to criminality when released into society. The accused has been unable to refrain from crime for any significant period whenever he was released from incarceration, with a maximum period of about two years in between incarcerations. The accused was last released in January 2021 and barely three months after being released, committed another offence in April 2021.</a></p><a id="p1_20-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_20-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, all the earlier punishments appeared to have limited rehabilitative or deterrent effect on the accused and were insufficient to deter the accused from turning to a life of crime and to commit further offences. Significantly, the accused had previously served <em>two terms</em> of Corrective Training of 8 and 10 years respectively. Barely three months after being released, the accused committed fresh offences and continued to offend even whilst on court bail and after a warrant of arrest was issued against him.</a></p><a id="p1_20-p2_c"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Circumstances of present offences</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current offences for which the accused has been convicted were serious ones and the circumstances of the accused’s present offending were consistent with the conclusions drawn above. Undeterred by his previous Corrective Training stint of 10 years, the accused shortly after release committed crimes of a similar nature including cheating and driving a motor vehicle without a license. As highlighted by the Prosecution, the accused’s present offences has also escalated to serious offences of UML harassment through the use of fire, racially sensitive gestures (placing pork meat at a unit occupied by a Malay family) and direct engagement with the occupants of various residential units, including both debtors and innocent occupants. The accused had even roped in and instructed other accomplices to commit the crimes in question (1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> charges). The accused’s criminal conduct directly impacted members of the public.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the Defence has argued that the accused had committed the present offences out of financial desperation, the facts also reveal the accused’s resort to the utility of crime to resolve immediate problems and the tendency to minimise the severity of the present offences. Notably, the accused’s comment of “what to do, no money?” as recorded in the PSR, speaks volumes.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the amalgamated charges of cheating by personation, driving a motor vehicle without license and driving a motor vehicle without insurance, the sustained period, and numerous occasions on which the offences were committed revealed the accused’s blatant disregard for the law.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Risk of future re-offending</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general risk factors highlighted in the PSR were concerning in three material aspects.</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_24-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the accused has no significant protective factors in his favour. The accused’s social circle continued to be made up of peers who were negative influences. In particular, he continued to associate with peers who offered him drugs and have pro-criminal tendencies. The reported familial support appeared to be limited and there is an absence of organised prosocial activities in the accused’s routine. Furthermore, the accused’s employment history revealed infrequent participation in the labour market, and he faced difficulty staying employed. While the accused’s attempt to improve himself by enrolling in courses was commendable, he failed to complete the two courses which were meant to enhance his chances of employment.</a></p><a id="p1_24-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_24-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the accused’s behaviour and attitude suggested that he viewed crime as the quick solution to immediate problems. As the accused committed the HUML offences to gain quick monies, there is a real risk that he will continue to re-offend in the same manner, especially if he remains unemployed. While the accused expressed hope and motivation to change, he did not provide any concrete plans or proposals.</a></p><a id="p1_24-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_24-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, I was of the view that the accused’s risk factors significantly outweighed any protective factors in this case. The accused is assessed in the PSR to have a moderate to high risk of criminal re-offending and belongs to a group of prisoners with a 43.8% probability of recidivism within two years of release. This probability was derived through a qualitative assessment of the various risk factors which were highlighted in the PSR and was not merely a matter of statistics. In <em>PP v Iskandar bin Tahar</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20843-SSP.xml')">[2017] SGDC 266</a>, the offender had a 30% probability of recidivism within 2 years of release and PD was nonetheless imposed. In <em>Rosli</em>, the offender was sentenced to 20 years’ preventive detention in circumstances where his probability of recidivism was assessed to be 49% to 60%. The accused’s assessed probability of 43.8% in the present case, which falls between the cases of <em>Iskandar</em> and <em>Rosli</em>, does not preclude the possibility of a PD sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering all the above in its totality, there was in my judgment a clear need to protect the public from the real risk of the accused’s future re-offending and to prevent him from being a menace to the public. He has further shown that he has a very low possibility of reform as the two previous lengthy stints of Corrective Training has failed to steer him away from a life of crime. I therefore did not think that a third stint of Corrective Training was appropriate as I had little confidence in its utility in reforming the recalcitrant accused. Section 304(2) CPC provides that once the court is satisfied that it is expedient for the protection of the public to impose a term of PD, it should do so unless it has special reasons for not doing so. Special reasons would generally refer to an accused’s physical and mental suitability for PD, and in any event, must be exceptional: <em>PP v Perumal s/o Suppiah</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2000] 2 SLR(R) 0145.xml')">[2000] 2 SLR(R) 145</a> at [41]. As the accused has been assessed to be physically and mentally suitable to undergo PD, there were no special reasons in the present case not to impose PD.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Length of PD</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I next considered the appropriate length of PD to be imposed on the accused.
