He sued the defendants for introducing him to Ufun. He claimed that they knowingly made false representations to induce him to invest.</a></p><a id="p1_1"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the trial, the plaintiff filed closing submissions which abandoned his claim in fraud. He advanced arguments solely for a claim in unjust enrichment. Neither the claim in unjust enrichment nor the abandoned fraud claim was made out on the evidence and I dismissed the plaintiff’s claim. The plaintiff has filed an appeal and I set out my detailed grounds of decision.</a></p><a id="p1_2"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff is a businessman and the principal of the company Fire Terminator International Pte Ltd, whose main business is manufacturing and selling firefighting products.</a></p><a id="p1_3"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendants are husband and wife. The plaintiff and the 2nd defendant came to know each other because the plaintiff’s company used the 2nd defendant’s employer for freight forwarding services. The 2nd defendant later introduced his wife, the 1st defendant, to the plaintiff in the context of the UFun scheme. The 2nd defendant was himself invested in the Ufun scheme, and was the plaintiff’s “upline”. This meant that within the scheme, the 2nd defendant was the one who introduced the plaintiff and benefitted from the plaintiff’s participation.</a></p><a id="p1_4"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff’s witnesses were himself and his brother-in-law, one Mr Anthony Cruze. The gist of Mr Cruze’s evidence was that the plaintiff invested SGD 15,000 on Mr Cruze’s behalf in the Ufun scheme and Mr Cruze witnessed the plaintiff hand this money in cash to the 2nd defendant.</a></p><a id="p1_5"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendants appeared as witnesses and also called the 2nd defendant’s father, one Mr Lee Ser Tiong, as a witness. The gist of Mr Lee’s evidence was that he was the 2nd defendant’s “upline”. He received the plaintiff’s investment of SGD 14,500 from the 2nd defendant and handed it to the Malaysian principal of the Ufun scheme.</a></p><a id="p1_6"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants in the Ufun scheme purchased a digital currency called Utokens. Utokens could be used to purchase goods and services on the Ufun platform. Utokens were also expected to appreciate in value and be exchanged for cash.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing participants in the Ufun scheme could earn bonus Utokens by opening new accounts or sponsoring new participants to open accounts.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 24 April 2015, the plaintiff received news that the Ufun scheme was an illegal pyramid scheme.

The defendant’s counsel objected to the question on the basis that no claim was being made against Lee Ser Tiong. I allowed the objection and disallowed the question on the basis that I did not think it relevant to the issues in dispute. In particular, in my view, whether or not Lee Ser Tiong knew that bringing SGD 20,000 in cash over the border was a crime was not relevant to the question of whether the 1st and 2nd defendants were personally enriched by the payment of the SGD 14,500.</a></p><a id="p1_65-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_66">66&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2nd defendant and Lee Ser Tiong’s account of events was supported by the fact that the plaintiff’s Ufun account was created and the plaintiff was provided with his username and password.</a></p><a id="p1_66"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66"></a><a id="p1_66-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendants’ evidence was that the plaintiff’s account was created, and the plaintiff’s username and password was given to him by the 1st defendant’s email of 22 Dec 2014.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a> By as early as 22 December 2014, the plaintiff was provided with the username and password for his Ufun account.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 24 April 2015, after the news of Ufun being a pyramid scheme broke out, the plaintiff asked the 2nd defendant over WhatsApp chat for his password for his Ufun account.
