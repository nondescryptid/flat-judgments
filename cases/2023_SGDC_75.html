It is a contagious respiratory viral disease that is easily spread through the droplets of infected persons, airborne transmission, or surface transmission. A person infected with COVID-19 can spread the disease even if he is asymptomatic.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organisation (“the WHO”) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. The WHO estimates that there have been 2,230,570 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 1,722 COVID-19-related deaths in Singapore as of 7 March 2023.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To combat the spread of COVID-19, the Singapore Government introduced vaccination differentiated safe management measures (“VDS”) which took effect from 10 August 2021. Under the VDS, unvaccinated persons were only allowed to take part in activities which carried a higher risk of COVID-19 transmission, such as dining in at food and beverage (“F&amp;B”) establishments, if they had a valid negative pre-event test (“PET”) result.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to an exponential rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in Singapore in around October 2021, the Singapore Government expanded the VDS with effect from 13 October 2021. Under the expanded VDS, unvaccinated persons were not allowed to enter shopping malls and large standalone stores, visit attractions, or dine in at F&amp;B establishments, hawker centres and coffee shops, unless they had a valid negative PET result. With effect from 1 January 2022, unvaccinated persons were not allowed to enter workplaces and VDS settings even if they had a valid negative PET result.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of October 2021, those who had received two full doses of the Sinopharm vaccine would be regarded as being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 for four months after the date on which they had received their second dose, or until 31 December 2021, whichever was later.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">FACTS RELATING TO THE CHARGE: DAC-909140-2022</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The co-accused persons are as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jipson Quah (“Dr Quah”), a 34-year-old male Singaporean. At the material time, he was a registered medical practitioner and owned several clinics, including: (i) Mayfair Medical Clinic, located at Block 182 Woodlands Street 13, #01-04, Singapore; and (ii) Mayfair Medical Clinic (Yishun Chong Pang), located at Block 103 Yishun Ring Road, #01-73, Singapore. His registration as a medical practitioner has been suspended.</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chua Cheng Soon Thomas (“Thomas”), a 41-year-old male Singaporean. At the material time, he worked as Dr Quah’s logistics supervisor and was responsible for the logistical affairs of Dr Quah’s clinics.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The involved party is Wonglangka Apinya (“Apinya”), a 32-year-old female Thai who is the accused’s wife.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In or around December 2021, the accused joined a “Healing the Divide” group chat on Telegram. “Healing the Divide” is an anti-vaccination group. The accused obtained Thomas’ contact number from the “Healing the Divide” Telegram group chat.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 26 December 2021, Thomas went to the accused’s home at the latter’s request. The accused, Apinya and their daughter (“Alanna”) were present. The accused told Thomas that he had a job offer in Australia but that he would face significant difficulty entering Australia if he was unvaccinated. He asked Thomas whether he could be certified as having been vaccinated without getting “the real vaccine”. The accused also asked Thomas whether Apinya could be certified as being medically ineligible to receive any COVID-19 vaccine, even though he knew that Apinya did not fulfill the vaccination exemption criteria set out by the Ministry of Health of Singapore (“the MOH”). Thomas replied that he would consult Dr Quah.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 27 and 28 December 2021, Thomas told Dr Quah that the accused wanted himself and Apinya to be certified as having been vaccinated against COVID-19 without actually receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. On Dr Quah’s instructions, Thomas arranged for the accused and Apinya to receive fake COVID-19 vaccines at Mayfair Medical Clinic. Thomas also unilaterally quoted a total price of $6,000 for the accused and Apinya. The accused agreed to pay Thomas $6,000 in exchange for the accused to be falsely certified as having been vaccinated against COVID-19 and for Apinya to be falsely certified as being medically ineligible to receive any COVID-19 vaccine. On or about 28 December 2021, Thomas collected a deposit of $2,000 from the accused.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the evening of 29 December 2021, Thomas informed Dr Quah that the accused had agreed to his quoted price of $6,000. Thomas also told Dr Quah that he had already collected $2,000 from the accused. Dr Quah acknowledged.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later that evening, Thomas drove the accused, Apinya and Alanna to Mayfair Medical Clinic. While in the car, the accused lied to Apinya that he had arranged for her to receive the Sinopharm vaccine. The accused, Apinya, Alanna, and Thomas reached the clinic at about 8pm.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the clinic, Dr Quah told the accused that he would administer the Sinopharm vaccine to the accused and Apinya. Despite what Dr Quah had said, the accused knew that Dr Quah was not in fact administering the Sinopharm vaccine to him and Apinya. Dr Quah then showed the accused a syringe filled with liquid and injected the accused with the liquid. Dr Quah likewise showed Apinya a syringe filled with liquid and injected her with the liquid. Apinya thought that she had been injected with the Sinopharm vaccine. Dr Quah had, however, injected the accused and Apinya with saline.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas drove the accused, Apinya and Alanna home. While in the car, the accused paid Thomas $2,000 for the first set of saline injections that he and Apinya had received.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Quah documented in his clinic’s medical records system that the accused and Apinya had each received their first dose of the Sinopharm vaccine. His staff then sent the vaccination records to the National Immunisation Registry (“the NIR”), which is maintained by the Health Promotion Board of Singapore (“the HPB”). On 7 January 2022, the NIR reflected that the accused and Apinya were partially vaccinated.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused asked Thomas to arrange another appointment for him and Apinya to receive their second set of saline injections from Dr Quah. The accused requested that the appointment be fixed on 15 January 2022 as he had read on the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority of Singapore’s website that the two doses of the Sinopharm vaccine ought to be administered at least 17 days apart. Thomas accordingly arranged for the accused and Apinya to attend at Mayfair Medical Clinic (Yishun Chong Pang) on 15 January 2022.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 15 January 2022, Thomas drove the accused, Apinya and Alanna to Mayfair Medical Clinic (Yishun Chong Pang) for the accused and Apinya to receive their second set of saline injections. The four of them reached the clinic at about 6.30pm.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the clinic, Dr Quah told the accused that he would administer the Sinopharm vaccine to the accused and Apinya. Despite what Dr Quah had said, the accused knew that Dr Quah was not in fact administering the Sinopharm vaccine to him and Apinya. Dr Quah then showed the accused a syringe filled with liquid and injected the accused with the liquid. Dr Quah likewise showed Apinya a syringe filled with liquid and injected her with the liquid. Apinya thought that she had been injected with the Sinopharm vaccine. Dr Quah had, however, injected the accused and Apinya with saline.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas drove the accused, Apinya and Alanna home. While on the way home, the accused paid Thomas the remaining $2,000 for the second set of saline injections that he and Apinya had received. Thomas and Dr Quah split the total payment of $6,000 between themselves.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Quah documented in his clinic’s medical records system that the accused and Apinya had each received their second dose of the Sinopharm vaccine. His staff then sent the vaccination records to the NIR. A few days later, the NIR reflected that the accused and Apinya were fully vaccinated.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By virtue of the above, the accused was party to a criminal conspiracy with Dr Quah and Thomas to commit an offence punishable under section 417 of the Penal Code 1871, namely, by agreeing with Dr Quah and Thomas to deceive the HPB into believing that he had received two doses of the Sinopharm vaccine, a fact which he knew to be false. By such a manner of deception, the accused intentionally induced the HPB to reflect in the NIR that he was fully vaccinated against COVID-19, which the HPB would not have done if it had not been so deceived, and which act was likely to cause harm to the HPB’s reputation. The accused has thereby committed an offence under section 417 read with section 120B of the Penal Code 1871.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MOH alerted the police to Dr Quah’s role in enabling patients to be falsely certified as having been vaccinated with the Sinopharm vaccine. Police investigations revealed that the accused was one of at least 17 patients who had been certified as being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 when they had in fact received saline injections from Dr Quah. The accused was arrested on 21 January 2022.”</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">(C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;REASONS FOR THE SENTENCE IMPOSED </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prosecution sought a sentence of 16 to 18 weeks’ imprisonment while the defence submitted for a fine, or alternatively, a sentence of 4 to 8 weeks’ imprisonment. After careful consideration of the written submissions and replies of both parties, I imposed on the AP a sentence of 16 weeks’ imprisonment for the charge in DAC-909140-2022. As submitted by the prosecution, my reasons are as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_4"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4"></a><a id=""> <em>Public interest considerations</em> </a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_4-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public interest considerations call for a deterrent sentence and a fine as submitted by the defence is wholly inappropriate. The COVID-19 pandemic was Singapore’s first public health emergency since the 2003 SARS outbreak. Even as of October 2021, there were still thousands of new COVID-19 cases daily. To cope with the surge in COVID-19 cases near the end of 2021, the Singapore Government introduced and then expanded a series of vaccination-differentiated safe management measures (“VDS”). The VDS were carefully calibrated to protect the unvaccinated and those at risk of developing serious COVID-19 symptoms, as well as reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and hence the strain on our healthcare system, while allowing the vaccinated to go about their day-to-day lives unimpeded. Unlike the approximately 91% of Singaporeans who have been vaccinated against COVID-19<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a>, the AP selfishly took advantage of the attendant privileges of being vaccinated without in fact being vaccinated. He was a willing participant in a fake vaccination scheme that undermined our national response to a global pandemic.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP, acting in concert with Dr Jipson Quah (“Dr Quah”) and Chua Cheng Soon Thomas (“Thomas”), sought to subvert the COVID-19 vaccination programme and the VDS, which were key pillars of Singapore’s fight against COVID-19. Given the context of the public health emergency in which the AP offended and his attempt to undermine the national COVID-19 vaccination programme, deterrence must feature prominently in the sentence imposed.</a></p><a id="p1_4-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_4-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the material time, Singapore was experiencing an “exponential rise” in the number of COVID-19 cases, which exerted a strain on Singapore’s healthcare capacity. About 15% of beds in public hospitals were used for COVID-19 cases while bed occupancy in intensive care units had increased from 26% to 53% .<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a> It was against this backdrop that the Singapore Government expanded the VDS which it had first introduced in August 2021. With effect from 13 October 2021, unvaccinated persons were not allowed to enter shopping malls and large standalone stores, visit attractions, or dine in at F&amp;B establishments, hawker centres and coffee shops.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expanded VDS were critical to Singapore’s efforts to stem the wave of COVID-19 infections. They protected the unvaccinated, who were more likely to contract COVID-19 and who were at greater risk of developing serious COVID-19 symptoms and COVID-19-related complications. At the same time, the expanded VDS sought to reduce the risk of breakthrough infections amongst vaccinated individuals who came into contact with those unvaccinated. The expanded VDS also safeguarded the health of the at-risk population – namely, those whose underlying medical conditions made them more susceptible to contracting COVID-19 and developing serious symptoms, as well as those who could not be vaccinated for medical reasons. The differentiated access to public spaces for the vaccinated and unvaccinated was thus crucial to protect <em>both</em> groups of people.</a></p><a id="p1_4-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_4-p2_e">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It remained open to the AP to be unvaccinated, but he would have had to bear the consequences of his decision – namely, not being able to access VDS settings unless he had a valid negative pre-event test (“PET”) result. The AP, however, was unwilling to either be vaccinated or undergo a PET before accessing VDS settings. With effect from 1 January 2022, two weeks before the AP received his second saline injection, the Singapore Government removed the exemption that allowed the unvaccinated to enter workplaces and VDS settings if they had a valid negative PET result. This was a reflection of the growing threat that COVID-19 posed to the public health. The AP made his bed by deciding to remain unvaccinated but refused to lie in it, choosing instead to skirt the expanded VDS.</a></p><a id="p1_4-p2_e"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_e"></a><a id="p1_4-p2_f">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above public interest considerations call for a deterrent sentence. In the context of a raging pandemic, the AP had no qualms about circumventing Singapore’s measures to contain the public health emergency. Knowing that a fully vaccinated status would allow him access to public spaces that he otherwise would not have access to, the AP conspired with Dr Quah and Thomas to defraud the Health Promotion Board of Singapore (“the HPB”) as to his vaccination status.</a></p><a id="p1_4-p2_f"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_f"></a><a id=""> <em>Aggravating factors</em> </a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_4-p2_g">(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the public interest considerations canvassed above, the following aggravating factors in the present case also warranted a substantial imprisonment term.</a></p><a id="p1_4-p2_g"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_4-p2_g"></a><a id="p1_4-p2_g-p3_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The offences were premeditated</u>: The criminal conspiracy was premeditated in at least three ways. First, the AP did not spontaneously decide to receive a saline injection when he visited Dr Quah’s clinic on 29 December 2021 and 15 January 2022. He had instead informed Thomas a few days in advance of his intention to be vaccinated with something other than “the real vaccine”. Thomas had, in turn, co-ordinated with Dr Quah to arrange for the AP to receive a fake COVID-19 vaccine. Second, the AP had taken care to ensure that the two saline injections were administered 17 days apart, per the guidelines on the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority of Singapore’s website, to avoid arousing suspicion. Third, the AP paid Thomas a total sum of $6,000, of which $2,000 was paid as a deposit before his first visit to Dr Quah’s clinic on 29 December 2021. At every step of the way, the AP made a calculated choice to partake in the criminal conspiracy. The premeditated nature of the AP’s offence calls for a deterrent sentence (<em>PP v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 2 SLR(R) 0334.xml')">[2007] 2 SLR(R) 334</a> (“<em>Fernando Payagala</em>”) at [39] and [41]).</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_4-p2_g-p3_ii">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Sophistication of offence and difficulty of detection</u>: The AP’s offence was sophisticated and difficult to detect. When a doctor certifies that a patient has been vaccinated against COVID-19 and sends the vaccination record to the NIR, it is nearly impossible for the HPB to verify whether the vaccination record is genuine. This is especially so given the sheer number of COVID-19 vaccination records that the NIR receives each day. The AP also took deliberate steps to conceal his offending – for example, he ensured that the timing of both his saline injections mirrored the recommended schedule for the administration of the Sinopharm vaccine. Such steps only compounded the difficulty of detecting the AP’s offence and warrant an uplift in sentence (<em>Fernando Payagala</em> at [42]).</a></p><a id="p1_4-p2_g-p3_ii"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_4-p2_g-p3_ii"></a><a id="p1_4-p2_g-p3_iii">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Public disquiet caused</u>: The AP’s offence resulted in public disquiet when it came to light. This was unsurprising, as his offence was an affront to the basic principle of exercising social responsibility. His defrauding a statutory board also generated considerable unease, with various news sites reporting on his offence.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a> The appropriate response to the ensuing public disquiet is a sufficiently deterrent sentence (<em>PP v Law Aik Meng</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 2 SLR(R) 0814.xml')">[2007] 2 SLR(R) 814</a> (“<em>Law Aik Meng</em>”) at [25(c)]).</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_4-p2_g-p3_iv">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The offence was committed against a public institution</u>: The AP’s offence was especially brazen because it was a carefully devised fraud perpetrated against the HPB, a statutory board under the Ministry of Health of Singapore. His fraud has inevitably dented public trust in the HPB, now that the integrity of the NIR has been undermined. Offences against public institutions must be deplored by way of a deterrent sentence, so as to safeguard the integrity of and public confidence in our public institutions (<em>Law Aik Meng at [24(a)]</em>).</a></p><a id="p1_4-p2_g-p3_iv"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_4-p2_g-p3_iv"></a><a id="p1_4-p2_g-p3_v">(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The AP actively took part in the criminal conspiracy</u>: Patients such as the AP were pivotal to the perpetration of the fraud. If not for willing co-conspirators like the AP, Dr Quah and Thomas would have been unable to implement their fake vaccination scheme. Further, the AP was not an acquiescent but an <em>active</em> participant in the criminal conspiracy. He was the one who had approached Thomas to enquire about receiving something other than “the real vaccine”; he was the one who had arranged for Apinya to receive two saline injections; and he was the one who had asked that both sets of saline injections be administered 17 days apart. The AP was thus intimately involved in perpetrating this fraud on the HPB.</a></p><a id="p1_4-p2_g-p3_v"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_4-p2_g-p3_v"></a><a id="p1_4-p2_g-p3_vi">(vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The AP was motivated by personal benefit</u>: The AP’s motivations were purely selfish – he wanted the benefit of accessing VDS settings and entering Australia without being vaccinated. Given that he could have either been vaccinated at little to no cost or borne the consequences that all other unvaccinated individuals had to bear, there are no grounds on which his offending can be excused. The court should not treat those who offend out of self-interest and greed with sympathy (<em>Zhao Zhipeng v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 4 SLR(R) 0879.xml')">[2008] 4 SLR(R) 879</a> at [37]).</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_4-p2_g-p3_vii">(vii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Apinya did not consent to being injected with saline</u>: It is highly aggravating that the AP also conspired with Dr Quah and Thomas for Apinya to be injected with saline instead of the Sinopharm vaccine. This criminal conspiracy formed the subject matter of a similar offence in DAC-909141-2022 which has been taken into consideration for sentencing. On both visits to Dr Quah’s clinic, the AP did not inform Apinya that Dr Quah would inject her with something that was <em>not</em> the Sinopharm vaccine, even though he was fully aware that Dr Quah would do so. Apinya, who was not fluent in English, did not understand Dr Quah when he explained that he had injected her and the AP with saline. Nor did the AP explain to her what had transpired in Dr Quah’s clinic after each visit. Even after receiving both saline injections, Apinya continued to believe that she had received the Sinopharm vaccine. Apinya therefore did not give her informed consent to being injected with saline. As the person who had arranged for Apinya to be injected with saline, the AP was the most culpable for this gross violation of her bodily autonomy.</a></p><a id="p1_4-p2_g-p3_vii"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_g-p3_vii"></a><a id=""> <em>Sentencing precedents</em> </a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_4-p2_h">(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present case is unique in its nature and context. Most other cases involving offences under section 417 of the Penal Code are thus of little assistance in determining the appropriate sentence in this case (<em>PP v Poh Yuan Nie and others</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25592-SSP.xml')">[2021] SGMC 5</a> (“<em>Poh Yuan Nie</em>”) at [173]).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One case that is of greater relevance is <em>PP v Tan Jia Yan</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23637-SSP.xml')">[2019] SGMC 60</a> (“<em>Tan Jia Yan</em>”) where the offender was a tuition teacher who had conspired with the principal and two other teachers of the tuition centre where she worked at to assist six students in cheating in their GCE ‘O’ Level examinations. She had helped the students to wear Bluetooth devices and skin-coloured “in-ear” earphones before their examinations. She had also attended the examinations as a private candidate with an iPhone strapped to her chest and had provided a live feed of the examination papers to her co-conspirators via FaceTime. Her co-conspirators then relayed the examination answers to the students via the Bluetooth devices and “in-ear” earphones that the students wore. On one occasion, the offender transmitted the examination answers to her co-conspirators while one of her co-conspirators assumed the role of attending the examination with an iPhone strapped to her chest. The offender, who was untraced, pleaded guilty to 26 charges under section 417 read with section 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”) and a charge under section 417 read with section 116 of the PC. The court imposed a sentence of nine months’ imprisonment for each charge under section 417 PC read with section 109 of the PC and a sentence of nine weeks’ imprisonment for the remaining charge. As the court ordered the sentences for four of the charges under section 417 read with section 109 of the PC to run consecutively, the aggregate sentence imposed was 36 months’ imprisonment. The offender’s appeal against sentence lapsed. In imposing a sentence of nine months’ imprisonment for each charge under section 417 read with section 109 of the PC, the court held (at [40]–[41]) that a sentence at the upper end of the usual range was warranted on account of three main aggravating factors. First, the offender had enabled the students to obtain a significant advantage by helping them to cheat during the GCE ‘O’ Level examinations, a foundational and internationally recognised examination (<em>Tan Jia Yan</em> at [41]). Second, the offences were sophisticated and hard to detect (<em>Tan Jia Yan</em> at [44]). Third, the wider impact of the offences was significant – apart from seeking to undermine an internationally recognised examination, the offences had also tarnished Singapore’s reputation as an education centre (<em>Tan Jia Yan</em> at [45]).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_j">(j)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the above three aggravating factors apply to the present case where the AP obtained the considerable benefit of accessing VDS settings despite not having been vaccinated. Although dining in at a hawker centre or visiting a shopping mall are activities which we would not bat an eyelid at today, it must be remembered that the AP obtained such a benefit while COVID-19 restrictions were still in force and while other unvaccinated individuals were <em>not</em> allowed to engage in such everyday activities. The benefit that he dishonestly obtained was thus significant in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the strict public health measures adopted by Singapore. Much like the offences in <em>Tan Jia Yan</em>, the present offence occasioned public disquiet and was sophisticated, difficult to detect and committed against an important institution (see [10]–[12] above). More fundamentally, both <em>Tan Jia Yan</em> and the present case involve nation-wide or international programmes that depend on the honest co-operation of every participant for their success, and a bold assault on those programmes. The principle of deterrence must therefore assume precedence in this case (see also <em>Poh Yuan Nie</em> at [160]).</a></p><a id="p1_4-p2_j"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_j"></a><a id="p1_4-p2_k">(k)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, <em>Tan Jia Yan</em> is more serious than the present case as the offender in <em>Tan Jia Yan</em> had played an instrumental role in enabling the six students to cheat, whereas the AP was not directly responsible for the other 17 or more patients receiving saline injections from Dr Quah. The cheating offence in <em>Tan Jia Yan</em> also garnered media attention internationally, and the relevant benefit in that case – namely, helping the students excel in the GCE ‘O’ Level examinations – was greater than in the present case. Balancing the public interest considerations, the various aggravating factors, the AP’s culpability and the harm caused, and even after accounting for his plea of guilt, a sentence of 16 weeks’ imprisonment is justified.</a></p><a id="p1_4-p2_k"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">(D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NO MERIT IN DEFENCE SUBMISSIONS</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4-p2_k"></a><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see no merit in and rejected the following defence submissions for the reasons as submitted by the prosecution:</a></p><a id="p1_5"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reliance on the case of <em>Lim Mong Hong v PP </em></a><em><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2003] 3 SLR(R) 0088.xml')">[2003] 3 SLR(R) 88</a> (“Lim Mong Hong”)</em>, the defence had argued it is largely irrelevant that the AP cheated a government body – namely, the HPB – since the HPB did not disburse public funds as a result of the AP’s deception. While the AP did not cause a loss of public funds, a deterrent sentence is still nonetheless warranted as the need to safeguard national resources is but one reason why the courts adopt a harsh approach in cases where a government body has been defrauded. Offences against government bodies compromise the administration and effectiveness of government policies. In <em>Dong Guitian v PP <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2004] 3 SLR(R) 0034.xml')">[2004] 3 SLR(R) 34</a></em>, the appellant submitted bogus applications to the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) to obtain Prior Approval for the recruitment of foreign workers. These applications were a scam devised by the appellant and some others to make a quick profit. On appeal, the appellant’s counsel similarly cited <em>Lim Mong Hong</em> and contended that a harsh sentence was not justified as the MOM had not suffered any financial loss. The High Court rejected this submission and held (at [40]) that although the MOM had not suffered any immediate and tangible financial loss, the appellant’s deception had frustrated the Singapore Government’s aim of effectively regulating and monitoring the recruitment of foreign labour in Singapore. In the same vein, a deterrent sentence is justified in the present case as the AP had compromised the effectiveness of our national COVID-19 vaccination programme and vaccination-differentiated safe management measures (“VDS”), which formed the key pillars of our fight against COVID-19. Conduct that impedes public policies must be categorically denounced (<em>PP v Law Aik Meng <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 2 SLR(R) 0814.xml')">[2007] 2 SLR(R) 814</a> (“Law Aik Meng”) at [24(d)]</em>).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offences against public institutions should also be met with stiff sentences to meet the ends of general deterrence. Other members of the public may be similarly tempted to circumvent public health measures, whether in the case of a future pandemic or in the event of a COVID-19 resurgence. A fine imposed on the AP would represent no more than a slap on the wrist, “a cynically calculated cost of breaking the law for personal [benefit]” (See <em>Abu Syeed Chowdhury v PP </em></a><em><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2002] 1 SLR(R) 0182.xml')">[2002] 1 SLR(R) 182</a> (“Abu Syeed Chowdhury”)</em> at [26]). If the principle of general deterrence is to carry any meaningful weight, a stiff custodial sentence must be imposed on the AP to signal firmly that such acts of deception do not pay (<em>Abu Syeed Chowdhury at [26]; Xia Qin Lai v PP <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1999] 3 SLR(R) 0257.xml')">[1999] 3 SLR(R) 257</a> at [29]</em>).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offences against public institutions also have the potential to undermine public trust in those institutions. A deterrent sentence is crucial to restoring public confidence as it assures the public that such offences will be met with utmost disapprobation. The case of <em>Lim Ek Kian v PP </em></a><em><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/212-M.xml')">[2003] SGHC 58</a></em> is instructive in this regard. The appellant in that case had forged a transfer form to cheat the Land Transport Authority into issuing a certificate for the transfer of rebates. He was convicted of an offence of forgery for the purpose of cheating. In upholding the sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment imposed, the High Court held (<em>at [33] and [37]</em>) that the appellant’s offence had to be “dealt with seriously” as it had adversely affected confidence in the integrity of Singapore’s system of vehicle registration. In the present case, the AP had dented public trust in the HPB and undermined the integrity of the National Immunisation Registry (“NIR”). An exemplary sentence must therefore be imposed to assure the public that the law does not treat such calculated acts of fraud lightly.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the defence submission that a harsh sentence is not warranted as the AP’s offences did not cause any public disquiet, it is evident from the various news reports of the AP’s offending that public disquiet did arise. The litmus test for whether public disquiet has resulted is not whether the AP had instigated others to commit similar offences, as the defence had submitted, but whether his actions threatened societal values cherished by Singaporeans. There can be no question that the AP’s fraud on the HPB offended the sensibilities of the public (<em>Law Aik Meng at [25(c)]</em>). His brazen misconduct was an assault on our collective efforts to stem the rising tide of COVID-19 cases. Offences like the present, which have caused public disquiet, will “almost inevitably merit deterrent sentencing” (See <em>Law Aik Meng at [25(c)]</em>). Further, while the VDS have since been lifted, the affront to our core value of civic-mindedness remains. It cannot be the case that members of the public, who had dutifully complied with the VDS, would now take a more generous view of the AP’s offending simply because the VDS are no longer in force. The lifting of the VDS therefore does not temper the need for a deterrent sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_e">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reliance on the case of <em>Lim Choon Kang v PP </em></a><em><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1993] 3 SLR(R) 0254.xml')">[1993] 3 SLR(R) 254</a> (“Lim Choon Kang”) at [6]</em> that “… fines instead of custodial sentences can be imposed where the amounts involved are not of great magnitude or consequence, but when the operation smacks of something on a considerable scale, a custodial sentence must necessarily follow”, the defence had submitted that a fine is appropriate as the AP’s fraud was not of a considerable scale, the case of <em>Lim Choon Kang</em> is, however, irrelevant as it only applies to cases of multiple share applications (<em>Lim Choon Kang at [1]</em>). This is clear from the High Court’s holding (at [7]) that a custodial sentence must be imposed on those who commit “such offences of multiple share applications on a substantial scale”. The High Court in <em>Idya Nurhazlyn bte Ahmad Khir v PP and another appeal <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 1 SLR 0756.xml')">[2014] 1 SLR 756</a> (“Idya”)</em> likewise interpreted that holding in <em>Lim Choon Kang</em> to mean that “… fines could be imposed instead of custodial sentences where the offence involved misleading share applications unless the operation in question was of a considerable or substantial scale”. The holding in Lim Choon Kang at [6], which the defence had cited, is hence not a general proposition that applies to all offences under section 417 of the Penal Code (“PC”) – it merely prescribes when the custodial threshold is crossed in cases of multiple share applications.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_f">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No weight should be placed on the unreported case of v Andy Joshua Warren ("Andy Joshua Warren") cited by the defence. Such unreported decisions are of limited precedential value as the facts of the case and the reasoning behind the sentences imposed are unknown. (<em>Toh Suat Leng Jennifer v PP </em></a><em><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29487-SSP.xml')">[2022] 5 SLR 1075</a> at [51]</em>). In any case, it is apparent from even the newspaper article of Andy Joshua Warren tendered by the defence that that case is readily distinguishable from the present. Not knowing that the MediSave claim limits had been raised, the offender in <em>Andy Joshua Warren</em> had authorised the submission of nine false MediSave claims to allow three patients to sidestep what he thought were the claim limits. There was no real prejudice to the Central Provident Fund Board since the patients could legitimately have claimed the full amounts from their MediSave accounts. The offender also did not personally benefit, whether financially or otherwise. As <em>Andy Joshua Warren</em> and the present case involved vastly different facts, the former is an unhelpful precedent on which no weight should therefore be placed.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_g">(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In submitting for a high fine, the defence makes much of the fact that the HPB did not suffer any (property) loss or part with any property. This defence submission is misplaced for the following reasons:</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_g"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_5-p2_g"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_g-p3_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of the loss occasioned is a relevant sentencing consideration, but it is not determinative of whether the custodial threshold is crossed. The defence cited the case of <em>Idya</em> for the proposition that a fine may be appropriate in cases where no loss is suffered. This proposition may hold true in general, but the present case is exceptional. This case, unlike other cases under section 417 of the PC, concerns a premeditated conspiracy to cheat the HPB against the backdrop of an unprecedented public health emergency. A custodial sentence is warranted as a matter of sound principle - the AP's deception was hard to detect, engendered public unease, and frustrated public policy intent. Where public interest considerations arise, such as in this case, "the fact that no actual harm or loss was suffered by any party [is] of less relevance" (<em>PP v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar </em></a><em><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 2 SLR(R) 0334.xml')">[2007] 2 SLR(R) 334</a> ("Fernando Payagala") at [49]</em>).</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_5-p2_g-p3_ii">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of <em>Poh Yuan Nie</em> shows that whether the HPB suffered any tangible loss should be a secondary consideration in this instance. In <em>Poh Yuan Nie</em>, which involved a conspiracy to assist some students with cheating in their GCE 'O' Level examinations, the court rejected the very argument that the defence now raised in the present case. Counsel for one of the conspirators in that case likewise cited <em>Idya</em> and sought a fine or an aggregate sentence of no more than two weeks' imprisonment on the basis that no monetary loss was caused. The court held (at [158]) that counsel's reliance on <em>Idya</em> was "misplaced" as it failed to account for the reputational harm suffered by both Singapore and the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board ("SEAB"). The defence's reliance on <em>Idya</em> in this case should be rejected for the same reason.</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_g-p3_ii"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_5-p2_g-p3_ii"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_g-p3_iii">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is untrue that the AP's offending "caused no real loss to HPB. The HPB did not incur any financial loss, but it did suffer intangible loss in the form of reputational harm as well as the eroded integrity of the NIR (<em>Fernando Payagala at [49]</em>). Such damage is no less real simply because it is intangible. The HPB's pristine reputation and the credibility of the NIR are crucial to ensuring co-operation with immunisation programmes and other nation-wide health initiatives. The AP's misconduct also resulted in considerable time and costs being expended in investigations (<em>Fernando Payagala at [49]</em>), especially since he was separately investigated by both the police and the Ministry of Health. The defence therefore cannot characterise the AP's offence as a harmless misadventure.</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_g-p3_iii"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_5-p2_g-p3_iii"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_g-p3_iv">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss occasioned by the AP's offending is merely one factor relevant to sentencing. Equally relevant is the benefit that the AP obtained - namely, being able to access VDS settings and enter Australia without being vaccinated or having to undergo pre-event testing. Apart from being in a position to enter Australia more easily than other unvaccinated individuals, the AP would also have been at liberty to access a great number of public spaces - such as hawker centres, F&amp;B establishments, and shopping malls - that he otherwise would not have had access to. His gain of such a significant advantage militates in favour of a deterrent sentence (<em>Poh Yuan Nie at [173]</em>). The defence contention that the AP's fraud was "temporal" as he had intended to leave Singapore for Australia in March 2022 cannot possibly be mitigating. To hold otherwise would be to give the AP credit for planning to leave the jurisdiction upon achieving one of the very purposes of his fraud - namely, to be able to enter Australia while unvaccinated.</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_g-p3_iv"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_5-p2_g-p3_iv"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_g-p3_v">(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence reliance on the case of <em>PP v Wong Cheng Rui [2016] SGD 325</em> to argue for a fine is of limited utility due to the exceptional circumstances of the present case. The court in <em>Poh Yuan Nie</em> (<em>ie</em>, the GCE ‘O’ Level Examinations cheating case) likewise did not find other precedents under section 417 of the PC to be particularly helpful, given the unusual facts at hand (<em>Poh Yuan Nie</em> at [173]). In any event, <em>Wong Cheng Rui</em> supports the position that a custodial sentence should be imposed even though no property loss was occasioned. The untraced offender in <em>Wong Cheng Rui</em> deceived the owner of a car sales company (“Xu”) into believing that he had paid Xu for the purchase of a car, thereby inducing Xu to deliver the car to him. Xu ultimately suffered no loss as the car was recovered. The offender pleaded guilty to an offence under section 417 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), with two similar offences taken into consideration. The court sentenced him to one week’s imprisonment and a fine of $15,000, even though Xu had not suffered any loss. The offender withdrew his appeal against sentence. Both <em>Wong Cheng Rui</em> and this case involved premeditated cheating offences (<em>Wong Cheng Rui</em> at [25]). But the present case is significantly more aggravated than <em>Wong Cheng Rui</em> due to the nature and context of the AP’s fraud. Simply by dint of the AP’s deception of a government body and the considerable advantage that he thereby obtained, the starting point must be more than the sentence of four to eight weeks’ imprisonment that the defence had sought in the alternative. Taking into account the other aggravating factors – namely, the difficulty of detecting the AP’s offence, his active role in the criminal conspiracy, his arranging for Apinya to receive a fake COVID-19 vaccine without her informed consent, and the resulting public disquiet – a sentence of at least 16 weeks’ imprisonment is justified. If any reliance on precedents need be had, it should be on <em>Tan Jia Yan</em> (as explained above), which is much more relevant than <em>Wong Cheng Rui</em> to the present case. The offender in <em>Tan Jia Yan</em> was one of the conspirators embroiled in the GCE ‘O’ Level examinations cheating case. Much like the AP in this case, the offender in <em>Tan Jia Yan</em> did not cause the SEAB to part with any property. The court nonetheless imposed a sentence of nine months’ imprisonment for each charge under section 417 read with section 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). This was in view of the significant advantage that the offender had helped the students to obtain, the difficulty of detecting the offences, and the resulting harm to Singapore’s reputation. All three aggravating factors apply in the present case.</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_g-p3_v"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_g-p3_v"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_h">(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence submissions that the AP's offence did not harm others is unpersuasive for two reasons. First, the defence argued that the AP likely did not increase the spread of COVID-19 in VDS settings as he was arrested before his vaccination status on the TraceTogether application had been updated. Even if this were true, it is purely fortuitous that such harm was averted because of timely intervention by the authorities (<em>Fernando Payagala at [49]</em>). That the AP was apprehended before he could access VDS settings is to no credit of his. Second, there was a real risk of the AP infecting others with COVID-19, had the authorities not arrested him promptly. The defence itself highlighted that the AP had a negative serology test result in September 2021 and a positive serology test result in March 2022. What this meant is that the AP had likely contracted COVID-19 at some point in that six-month period, and possibly after he had received his second saline injection on 15 January 2022. If the AP had contracted COVID-19 after his vaccination status on the TraceTogether application had been updated, he would have been able to roam freely in VDS settings even while being infected with COVID-19. Again, it was fortunate that he was arrested on 21 January 2022, not long before his TraceTogether application would have falsely reflected that he was fully vaccinated.</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_h"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_h"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence submission that the AP’s culpability was low as he had extenuating reasons for offending is of no merit. The defence argued that the AP offended primarily out of concern for Apinya’s health. The narrative crafted is a sympathetic but ultimately incomplete one as the AP himself did not suffer from any health condition. There is no excuse for the AP’s receiving a fake COVID-19 vaccine. He simply and selfishly did not wish to be vaccinated. The AP’s worries over the possible side effects of a COVID-19 vaccine on Apinya’s health also did not excuse his conspiring with Dr Quah and Thomas for Apinya to receive a fake COVID-19 vaccine. All Singaporean residents were subject to the same vaccine exemption criteria. Those with health conditions that did not render them eligible for an exemption similarly had to decide whether to be vaccinated or to remain unvaccinated and bear the attendant consequences. This was a trade-off that every other similarly situated individual had to make; it was not up to the AP to take matters into his own hands. The defence attempts to cast the AP in a sympathetic light by stressing that he was worried over Apinya’s well-being are of no merit.</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_i"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_i"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_j">(j)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence contention that the AP did not actively participate in the criminal conspiracy as he did not intend to partake in Dr Quah's and Thomas' wider fraud is misconceived as it is not and has never been the prosecution’s case that the AP took part in the criminal conspiracies involving other patients. But the AP did play an active role in the specific criminal conspiracy at hand. He approached Thomas to ask about receiving something other than "the real vaccine"; he arranged for Apinya to receive her two saline injections; and he requested that both sets of saline injections be administered 17 days apart to avoid arousing the authorities' suspicion. Far from being a passive participant who merely went along with Dr Quah's and Thomas' every suggestion, the AP was heavily involved in every step of the criminal conspiracy.</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_j"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_j"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_k">(k)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence claim that the AP “did not even know for a fact what Dr Quah [had injected] him and Apinya with” is a red herring. What is material is that the AP knew that Dr Quah had injected him and Apinya with something that was <em>not</em> the Sinopharm vaccine. It is irrelevant whether the AP is the only patient who has been charged thus far since the defence does not allege that the AP has been subjected to impermissibly differential treatment <em>vis-à-vis</em> other patients.</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_k"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_k"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_l">(l)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP’s personal circumstances are not mitigating. The court should not have regard to the loss of the AP’s job offer with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia or any future difficulties he may face in seeking employment. Any adverse impact on his career or job prospects is a natural consequence of his offending and should be given no mitigating weight (<em>M Raveendran v </em></a><em><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/27671-SSP.xml')">[2022] 3 SLR 1183</a> at [39] and [47]</em>). As for the hardship that the AP’s offending has visited upon his family, it is settled that familial hardship is of scant mitigating value, save in “some very exceptional or extreme” circumstances that are absent in the present case (<em>Chua Ya Zi Sandy v PP <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26485-SSP.xml')">[2021] SGHC 204</a> at [11]–[12]</em>). The AP had no misgivings about participating in the criminal conspiracy, despite knowing full well the consequences that would befall his family if he was caught and punished. He who lives on borrowed time cannot complain when the clock runs out.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_m">(m)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be emphasised that the AP had conspired with Dr Quah and Thomas to subvert the COVID-19 vaccination programme and the VDS, in the context of a once-in-a-lifetime global pandemic, and at a time when the number of COVID-19 cases in Singapore was growing exponentially. Single-mindedly concerned with his own convenience, the AP had no qualms about jeopardising the public good. Given the public interest considerations engaged, a harsh deterrent sentence must be imposed not only to rectify the AP's wrong, but also to deter those who may be emboldened to perpetrate such audacious acts of fraud in the future (<em>PP v Poh Yuan Nie and others </em></a><em><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25592-SSP.xml')">[2021] SGMC 5</a> ("Poh Yuan Nie") at [163]</em>).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">(E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONCLUSION</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present case represents an audacious assault on nation-wide public health measures – measures which were enacted to contain a worsening public health emergency, and which required the honest co-operation of all Singapore residents. The sentence imposed must resonate with the public’s shock at the AP’s brazen fraud on the HPB, which threatened to make a mockery of those public health measures.</a></p><a id="p1_6"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, I took the view that the aforesaid global sentence of 16 weeks’ imprisonment which I have imposed on the AP was not manifestly excessive or inadequate, but entirely appropriate and consistent with the principles of proportionality and totality without the effect of a crushing sentence on the AP.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"></a><p class="Footnote"><a id="p1_7"><sup></sup></a><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a>Section 417 of the Penal Code 1871 states: “Whoever cheats shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 years, or with fine, or with both.” Section 120B of the Penal Code 1871 states: “Whoever is party to a criminal conspiracy shall, where no express provision is made in this Code for the punishment of such a conspiracy, be punished in the same manner as if he had abetted the offence that is the subject of the conspiracy.”</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>See YCharts, “Singapore Coronavirus Full Vaccination Rate” (31 January 2023) &lt;https://ycharts.com/indicators/singapore_coronavirus_full_vaccination_rate&gt; (accessed 17 March 2023) at Annex A of the prosecution’s sentencing submissions dated 17 March 2023.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>See Audrey Tan, “Longer waiting times as Singapore’s healthcare capacity impacted by recent ‘exponential rise’ in Covid-19 cases: Janil”, <em>The Straits Times</em> (4 October 2021) in Annex B of the prosecution’s sentencing submissions dated 17 March 2023.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>See Shaffiq Alkhatib, “Aussie allegedly conspired with GP to unlawfully obtain Covid-19 vaccination certificates”, <em>The Straits Times</em> (8 June 2022) and Davina Tham, “Iris Koh, suspended doctor and assistant linked to Healing the Divide group get more charges”, <em>CNA</em> (27 July 2022) at Annexes C and D of the prosecution’s sentencing submissions dated 17 March 2023.</p></div></content></html>
