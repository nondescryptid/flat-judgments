At about 12.58 pm, the officers saw <b>V1</b> parked at the Pick-up point of Block 364A Sembawang Crescent, Singapore (“the Pick-up Point”). Subsequently, the accused alighted and was seen behaving suspiciously beside the passenger side door of <b>V1</b>. Suspecting that there were duty unpaid cigarettes in <b>V1</b>, at about 1.01 pm, the officers identified themselves to the accused and conducted a check on <b>V1</b>. Upon checking, the officers found <b>1,112 cartons x 160 sticks and 80 packets x 16 sticks Gudang Garam Surya brand of duty unpaid cigarettes</b> (“<b>C1</b>”) in the rear compartment of <b>V1</b>. <b>The accused admitted knowledge and ownership of C1</b> and was arrested. <b>C1</b>, <b>V1</b>, 1 lot of brown carton boxes and 1 lot of clear plastic wraps found in <b>V1</b> were seized as case exhibits.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>Facts pertaining to DAC-917090-2022</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the search, the officers found another van key in the accused’s possession. Upon further questioning by the officers, the accused informed that the key was for <b>V2</b> which was parked at Deck 4A of Block 365 Sembawang Crescent Multi Story Carpark, Singapore (“the Carpark”). At about 1.50 pm, the officers conducted a follow-up search on <b>V2</b> at the Carpark and found a further <b>2,500 cartons x 200 sticks of assorted brand of duty-unpaid cigarettes</b> ("<b>C2</b>") stored in various compartments of <b>V2</b>. <b>The accused admitted knowledge and ownership of C2</b>. <b>C2</b>, <b>V2</b> and one lot of carton boxes which <b>C2</b> were found in were seized as case exhibits.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>Investigation findings</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investigations revealed that since October 2022, the accused was working on a part time delivery job for an unknown Malay male known to him as “Abang”. Sometime in the night of 31 October 2022, the accused met Abang, together with 2 other unknown Malay males known to the accused as “Ann” and “Kecik”. Abang passed <b>V2</b>’s keys to the accused and Ann instructed the accused to drive <b>V2</b> to Pandan Loop with Kecik to transfer duty unpaid cigarettes from a lorry to <b>V2</b>. The accused agreed and, at about 11 pm, Kecik and the accused proceeded to Pandan loop in <b>V2</b>. At the same time, a group chat with Abang, Kecik and the accused was created on WhatsApp mobile application. Abang would provide the instructions about the collection of duty unpaid cigarettes to Kecik and the accused via the group chat, and Kecik would update the accused of the same while he was driving <b>V2</b>.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1 November 2022, at about 1.30 am, Kecik and the accused located the lorry at Pandan Loop. Kecik, together with the lorry driver, unloaded boxes of duty unpaid cigarettes from the lorry, while the accused loaded them into <b>V2</b>. Thereafter, Kecik and the accused proceeded to the Carpark in <b>V2</b>. Kecik then left while the accused received additional instructions from Abang to transfer some of the duty unpaid cigarettes from <b>V2</b> into <b>V1</b> which was already parked at the Carpark. The accused did so and informed Abang after he was done.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abang then instructed the accused to drive and deliver the duty unpaid cigarettes in <b>V1</b> according to a delivery list provided by Abang via WhatsApp. This list included information on the location, quantity to deliver and amount of cash to collect from the customers of the cigarettes. The accused was told to store the remaining duty unpaid cigarettes, namely, <b>C2</b>, in <b>V2</b> and to park <b>V2</b> at the Carpark. <b>The accused was promised $1,000 for each day of delivery. The accused agreed to do so. At the end of each day’s delivery, the accused would meet and pass the cash collected to Abang.</b></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the night of 2 November 2022, Abang instructed the accused to pick up one unknown Malay male using <b>V1</b> and to proceed to Pandan Loop to collect <b>C1</b> from a lorry. On 3 November 2022, at about 2 am, the accused and the unknown male arrived at Pandan Loop in <b>V1</b> and transferred <b>C1</b> from the lorry to <b>V1.</b> Thereafter, the accused sent the unknown male home and parked <b>V1</b> containing <b>C1</b> at the Carpark. At about 11 am, Abang informed the accused that he would have to deliver <b>C1</b> to others. The accused then drove <b>V1</b> containing <b>C1</b> to the Pick-up Point at 1.01pm pending further delivery instructions from Abang, when he was arrested by the officers.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>Excise duties leviable</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused knew that the excise duties leviable on <b>C1</b> and <b>C2</b> were unpaid at the material time the offences were committed.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The excise duty leviable on <b>C1</b> weighing a total of 262.313 kilogrammes is $153,036.80.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The excise duty leviable on <b>C2</b> weighing a total of 421.344 kilogrammes is $213,500.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By virtue of the foregoing, the accused, on 3 November 2022, at about 1.01 pm, was concerned in the delivery of uncustomed goods, that is <b>C1</b>.

The following factors were held by the High Court held (<em>at [29] to [32])</em> to be relevant to sentencing for customs offences (emphasis in bold added):</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">“28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;<em>Moey Keng Kong v PP</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;(“<em>Moey Keng Kong</em>”), Yong Pung How&nbsp;CJ (at [10]) identified five factors that he considered were relevant to sentencing for customs offences, as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-3"> <b>… the amount of duty evaded, the quantity of goods involved, repetition of the offence, whether the offender was acting on his own or was involved in a syndicated operation, and the role of the offender.</b> </p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my judgment, these can be distilled into four factors. The first is the <b>quantity of tobacco product imported</b>. Because this has a direct and virtually linear correlation to the amount of duty evaded the two should properly be regarded together.</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next factor is the <b>repetition of the offence</b>. While this will generally be relevant in all sentencing decisions, it should be noted that the Customs Act already provides for uplifts of sentences where the offender has committed previous customs offences: see ss&nbsp;128L(3), 128L(5) and 128L(5A). The application of these sections would provide different starting points for the sentencing exercise. Hence, there might be no need to have separate regard to whether the accused has committed previous&nbsp;<em>like</em>&nbsp;offences if and to the extent that this has already been factored into the charges brought against the accused. However, where the prior offence is not a Customs Act offence or in any case is not an offence that has already been factored into the charge, the fact of the offender’s antecedents should rightly be considered within the rubric of general aggravating factors (see&nbsp;<em>Sentencing Practice</em>&nbsp;(<u>[24]</u>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>) at p&nbsp;141).</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third factor is <b>whether the offender was acting on his own</b> or was involved in a syndicated operation. The fact that an offender commits the offence as part of a syndicate is an established aggravating factor that may justify an enhanced sentence in the interest of general deterrence:&nbsp;<em>PP v Law Aik Meng</em>&nbsp;<u><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 2 SLR(R) 0814.xml')">[2007] 2 SLR(R) 814</a></u>&nbsp;at [25]. Having said that, in most cases where substantial weights are involved and require modifications of vehicles, this element will be found. The precedents will therefore often have incorporated some consideration of this factor.</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the final factor, <b>the role of the offender</b>, this too might to some extent be encapsulated in the kind of charge that is preferred…..”</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In applying the above High Court case, the following were relevant sentencing considerations as highlighted by the prosecution in the present case:</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_c-p3_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quantity of duty unpaid cigarettes involved in the 1st charge was 262.313 kg and the excise duty evaded on these cigarettes was $153,036.80.

If such a quantity was the subject matter of a single charge, the benchmark sentence from <em>Pang Shuo</em> would be more than 28 months’ imprisonment while that from <em>Yap Ah Lai</em> would be between 30 to 36 months’ imprisonment. I agreed with the prosecution that an uplift from the aforesaid proposed sentence is warranted as the offences in both proceeded charges arose from different occasions, which indicates a pattern of reoffending with 4 other similar GST or excise duty evasion charges to be taken into consideration. The 2<sup>nd</sup> charge in DAC-917089-2022 concerned the GST evaded on the 262.313 kg of duty unpaid cigarettes valued at $163.520.00 which amounted to $11,446.40. The 4<sup>th</sup> charge in DAC-917091-2022 concerned the GST evaded on the 421.344 kg of duty unpaid cigarettes valued at $242,750.00 which amounted to $16,992.50. The 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> charges in DAC-917092-2022 and DAC-917093-2022 pertained to the 5.682 kg of duty unpaid cigarettes which the AP stored in his residence at Block 364A Sembawang Crescent [redacted], Singapore and the excise duty evaded on these cigarettes was $2,732.80 while the GST evaded was $217.50.</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id=""></a><a id="">(viii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, given the large quantities of duty unpaid cigarettes in both the 2 proceeded charges and the 4 TIC charges as well as the loss of government revenues from the large sums of unpaid excise duty and GST in all the aforesaid charges, there is a strong public policy interest to impose a specific and general deterrent sentence on the AP to deter him from future offending, and also to discourage other people from committing similar offences by setting an example of what the consequences of these offences can be.</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id=""></a><a id="">(ix)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found nothing mitigating in the AP’s oral mitigation plea (wherein he pleaded for leniency as he is the sole breadwinner and needs to support his family) as it is trite that hardship to an offender’s family is not normally a circumstance which will be taken into account for the purposes of sentencing, and the courts will not normally mitigate a sentence on the ground that the offender’s family will suffer because this is regarded as a normal concomitant of imprisonment<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="">(x)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all the above reasons, I accepted the prosecution submission for at least 11 months’ imprisonment to be imposed for the charge in DAC-917088-2022 and for at least 20 months’ imprisonment to be imposed for the charge in DAC-917090-2022.</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id=""></a><a id="">(xi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general rule is that sentences for unrelated offences should be ordered to run consecutively as each offence should attract its own distinct consequence. Single offenders and multiple offenders should not generally be treated alike. Concurrent sentences for unrelated offences would not adequately serve, and in fact may undermine, the sentencing considerations that underlie the individual sentences comprising the aggregate term. Offenders who are sentenced at one sitting should not be treated materially more leniently or more seriously than offenders who are sentenced separately, and the Court needs to avoid any suggestion that a multiple offender may benefit from a bulk discount in sentencing.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="">(xii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, in terms of the global sentence, as the duty unpaid cigarettes in the 1st and 3rd charges in DAC-917088-2022 and DAC-917090-2022 respectively were unrelated and arose from separate and distinct transactions involving the delivery of uncustomed goods using a van and the storage of uncustomed goods using another van, I agreed with the prosecution that the sentences for both charges ought to run consecutively, resulting in a global sentence of 31 months’ imprisonment to be imposed on the AP.</a></p><a id=""> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">(D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONCLUSION</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the aforesaid global sentence of 31 months’ imprisonment which I have imposed on the AP was not manifestly excessive or inadequate, but entirely appropriate and consistent with the principles of proportionality and totality without the effect of a crushing sentence on the AP.
