Applying this trite principle to the present case, the plaintiff bears the legal burden of proving all the elements of his claim in negligence, namely that the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff, that the defendant had breached that duty of care, and that the breaches had caused the plaintiff to suffer loss: see also <em>Grace Electrical Engineering Pte Ltd v Te Deum Engineering Pte Ltd</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21295-SSP.xml')">[2018] 1 SLR 76</a> (“<em>Grace Electrical Engineering</em>”) at [39].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the premises, I reject the plaintiff’s submission that the defendant bears the legal burden of proving that the lamppost did not have to be maintained. That submission was no more than a misconceived attempt to reverse the legal burden of proving breach of the duty of care. It appeared to arise from a misunderstanding of the holding in <em>SCT</em> that the respondent there bore the legal burden of proving the purposes of various payments it had made. In that case, the appellant sued the respondent for a debt owed, and the respondent pleaded in its defence that the debt had been fully paid via various payments: see <em>SCT</em> at [22].<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a> In other words, the respondent ran a ‘confession and avoidance’ defence: it confessed to the truth of what was alleged against him (i.e., the existence of the debt) but attempted to avoid the effect of such an allegation by asserting that payment had been made: see <em>SCT</em> at [23].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> It was in that context that the Court of Appeal held that the respondent bore the legal burden of proving the facts on which he relied on to avoid liability, namely the purpose of the alleged payments.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present case was distinguishable from <em>SCT</em> as the defendant did not run a confession and avoidance defence. On the contrary, the defendant denied that it had breached its duty of care. Since breach of duty of care was a fundamental element of the plaintiff’s claim, and the defendant had denied any such breach, it behoved the plaintiff to prove that there were such breaches.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the plaintiff has discharged its burden of proving negligence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having clarified that the plaintiff bore the legal burden of proving that the defendant had breached its duty of care, I then examined the issue of whether the plaintiff has discharged his burden.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step in this enquiry is to determine the standard of care to be imposed on the defendant. In this regard, the standard of care is pegged to the objective standard of a reasonable person, in the class of persons to which the defendant belongs, that is, the standard of a reasonably competent property management agency. Factors relevant to determining the standard of care are the likelihood and risks of harm, the extent of harm, the costs of avoiding harm, and industry standards. After determining the applicable standard of care, I must then ascertain whether, on the facts of the case, the defendant had breached that standard.

The plaintiff’s case was that the defendant was required, but failed, to implement a system of regular inspection and proper maintenance of the lamppost (see [7] above). However, none of the plaintiff’s witnesses gave evidence on what exactly this requirement entailed, whether by reference to the likelihood and risks of harm, the extent of harm, the costs of avoiding harm, or industry standards. Ms Ang’s evidence was mainly on the events that occurred on the day of the incident, while the focus of Mr Siva’s evidence was on showing that the lamppost had fallen due to corrosion as opposed to wind speed. In any event, Ms Ang and Mr Siva were not qualified to opine on what a reasonably competent property management agency would have done in terms of inspecting and maintaining the lamppost. They did not claim to be from the estate management industry, or to have experience in estate management matters.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even assuming, for argument sake, that the applicable standard of care required the defendant to regularly inspect the lamppost for <em>visible</em> signs of damage, corrosion or rust and to take reasonable measures to address the concerns posed by such signs, I was not satisfied that the defendant had breached such a standard. There was insufficient evidence before me of any visible signs of damage, corrosion or rust on the lamppost prior to the day of the incident, which the defendant had failed to detect and act upon.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Mr Siva had opined that there were two tell-tale (i.e., visible) signs of corrosion on the lamppost:<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, portions of the paint topcoat at the base of the lamppost were missing, as encircled in photograph 5 of his report.</a></p><a id="p1_20-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_20-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, blisters had formed close to the concrete base of the lamppost, as marked by the arrows in photograph 6 of his report.</a></p><a id="p1_20-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect, I was unable to accept that these were visible signs of corrosion for the following reasons.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the encircled area in photograph 5, there appeared to be a step down, in terms of the thickness of the pipe, at the fractured portion of the lamppost. However, I found it impossible to conclude, from the photograph alone, that the step down was due to portions of the paint topcoat being missing, as opposed to the product of the lamppost fracturing. This was underscored by the fact that there were no photographs of what the lamppost looked like before the incident.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to photograph 6, Mr Siva’s opinion, based purely on visual observation of the lamppost in this photograph, was that the areas marked by the arrows were blisters and not impurities. In this regard, Mr Siva explained that:<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paint had clearly detached from these areas, which would leave a gap for air to enter. When air entered, oxygen was supplied and the structure would begin to corrode. This caused blisters to form.</a></p><a id="p1_23-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_23-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blisters which have been forming for some time would be longer and narrower, and protrude out less: they would have a wormlike appearance. The areas marked by the arrows in photograph 6 did have a wormlike appearance.</a></p><a id="p1_23-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Siva ultimately conceded that apart from corrosion, there were other possible causes of blistering such as the manufacturing and finishing process or the presence of impurities, and that he did not conduct any tests to verify whether the areas marked by the arrows in photograph 6 were blisters or impurities.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a> He also did not have any photographs of what the lamppost looked like before the incident to verify whether the alleged blisters were the product of the manufacturing and finishing process. In the premises, I was not satisfied that on the balance of probabilities, the areas marked by the arrows were blisters that were indicative of corrosion.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Ms Ang, she gave evidence in her AEIC, and at trial, that she had observed on the day of the incident that the lamppost was rusty both internally and externally.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a> She marked, using arrows on page 12<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> of Exhibit P1 (i.e., a bigger version of photograph 5 of Mr Siva’s report), the allegedly rusty portions of the lamppost. I did not find her evidence that the lamppost was externally rusty to be credible. There was no mention that the lamppost was visibly rusty in her police report which was filed mere hours after the incident, or in the Statement of Claim. Furthermore, it was unclear from page 12 of exhibit P1 that the rusty portions of the lamppost were in fact externally visible prior to the falling of the lamppost.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the forgoing reasons, I dismissed the plaintiff’s claim.</a></p><a id="p1_26"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Observations on whether the doctrine of res ipsa loquitor applied</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, for completeness, I set out below my views on whether the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitor</em> applied in the present case.</a></p><a id="p1_27"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Res ipsa loquitor</em> is a rule of evidence that enables a plaintiff to establish a <em>prima facie</em> case of negligence in the event that there is insufficient direct evidence to establish the cause of the accident in a situation where the accident would not have occurred in the ordinary course of things had proper care been exercised.

Instead, the defendant submitted that strong winds were more likely than not to “<em>also</em> [be] a proximate cause”.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a> I do not think this submission is tenable. It is Mr Siva’s unchallenged evidence that the minimum yield stress of steel is 2.4 x 10<sup>8</sup> N/m<sup>2</sup>, and that for the wind to topple the lamppost, the stress exerted by the wind would need to be more than the minimum yield stress of steel.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> On the day of the incident, the maximum wind speed measured at the two weather stations which were the closest to Mandarin Gardens – the East Coast Parkway weather station and the Marina Barrage weather station – were 59 km/h and 45.7 km/h respectively. I accept these wind speeds to be the best proxy for the maximum wind speed at Mandarin Gardens on the day of the incident.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> According to Mr Siva’s unchallenged calculations, wind blowing at 59 km/h would exert a pressure of 161.4 N/m<sup>2</sup>,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> which is far lower than the minimum yield stress of steel. To be precise, such pressure is, on my calculations, a mere 0.00006725% of the minimum yield stress of steel. In the premises, I find it implausible, on any view, that strong winds on the day of the incident could have been a proximate cause of the lamppost falling. The dominant cause of the lamppost falling was likely to have been internal corrosion, which had weakened the integrity of the lamppost.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the cause of the lamppost falling is known, the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitor</em> cannot apply to shift the evidential burden onto the defendant.</a></p><a id="p1_33"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I dismissed the plaintiff’s claim as he had failed to prove that the defendant was negligent.
