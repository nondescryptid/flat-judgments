PW3 was in the business of selling duty unpaid cigarettes. Having received the order, PW3 had packed 20 cartons of the said cigarettes from the stock that he kept in his bedroom of his flat at Block 299A Tampines Street 22. He packed them into a canvas bag. The packing was done in his bedroom. After that, he had placed the canvas bag on a trolley. On 15 March 2021, the Accused again contacted PW3 to tell him that he (the Accused) was on his way to the flat to collect the cigarettes. Because PW3 was at his workplace at the time, he told the Accused that his son, one Muhammed Ariffin Bin Noor Mohamed (“PW2”), would pass the cigarettes to him.</a></p><a id="p1_5"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused drove his NTUC Comfort taxi bearing registration numbers SHD7152H to the drop off point at the ground floor of PW3’s flat. He then waited for PW2 to come down with the cigarettes. At about 5.22 pm, PW2 arrived at the drop off point with the trolley containing the canvas bag. He helped the Accused to transfer the canvas bag into the boot of the Accused’s taxi. The Accused then drove away. When the Accused was arrested some time later, the said cigarettes were not recovered.</a></p><a id="p1_6"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining the weight and therefore the corresponding unpaid amounts of duties dealt with by the Accused, the prosecution had used similar cartons of Gudang Garam cigarettes seized by the Customs Department from PW3’s bedroom on the same day, 15 March 2021, as samples. This was because PW3 had confirmed with them that the 20 cartons of cigarettes which he had sold to the Accused were packed from the same stock that were seized from his bedroom.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defence’s case</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused had elected to remain silent.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused did not dispute the following facts in issue –</a></p><a id="p1_9"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_9-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had ordered 20 cartons of duty unpaid Gudang Garam cigarettes from PW3 prior to 15 March 2021.</a></p><a id="p1_9-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_9-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was the person to whom PW2 had handed over the canvas bag at the drop off point of PW3’s flat on 15 March 2021.</a></p><a id="p1_9-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main thrust of the Accused’s defence was that there was no evidence that the canvas bag contained 20 cartons of duty unpaid cigarettes when he took possession of the canvas bag from PW2. He said he had not counted the contents of the canvas bag. As the canvas bag and the contents had not now been recovered, the number of cartons delivered to him could not be definitively ascertained.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Accused raised the argument that he had been unjustly treated in being charged with the two offences. This was because the main protagonist, PW3, had not himself been charged for selling the 20 cartons of duty unpaid cigarettes to him.</a></p><a id="p1_11"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The issues</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key issues for determination were as follows –</a></p><a id="p1_12"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_12-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the Accused’s statement recorded pursuant to s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC”) voluntarily made?</a></p><a id="p1_12-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_12-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the Accused receive the 20 cartons of Gudang Garam cigarettes and did he know that they were duty unpaid cigarettes?</a></p><a id="p1_12-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_12-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was the weight of the 20 cartons of Gudang Garam cigarettes?</a></p><a id="p1_12-p2_c"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Analysis of the evidence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was the Accused’s long statement made by him voluntarily?</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would first address the first issue set out above concerning the admissibility of the Accused’s statement (“P1”) made to Customs Officer Muhammad Noor Bin Noordin (“PW4”). This was because the prosecution relied on P1 to prove that the canvas bag which was delivered to the Accused on 15 March 2021 contained the 20 cartons of duty unpaid Gudang Garam cigarettes from PW2, and that the Accused knew this.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused had challenged the admissibility of P1. His challenges were as follows –</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_14-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had reported at the Customs Operations Centre (“COC”) as requested on 6 May 2021 at 11.00 am. He was then made to wait for some four hours at the lobby before he was brought into the interview room for P1 to be recorded from him. On that day, he was observing his fast as it was the Muslim month of Ramadan. The lobby was air-conditioned, he had felt very cold. The cold and the long wait coupled with his observance of the fast had caused him to feel stressed out.</a></p><a id="p1_14-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_14-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the pre-recording interview conducted by PW4, he alleged that PW4 had told him to cooperate with them; that they would only be charging PW3, and he would be used as evidence against PW3.</a></p><a id="p1_14-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_14-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the stress that he had felt earlier, and the inducement offered by PW4, he had confessed to PW4. He had just agreed with everything that PW4 had suggested to him. When the statement was printed out, he alleged that he had signed without reading the contents because he had wanted to leave the place quickly as it was close to the time to break his fast.</a></p><a id="p1_14-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P1 was recorded on 6 May 2021. The recording stated at 3.10 pm and it ended at 5.25 pm. It was not disputed that the Accused had waited at the COC lobby from 11.00 am. It was also not disputed that the lobby was air-conditioned. However, in cross-examination, I noted that the Accused had agreed that PW4 had informed him that he could leave the COC if he had wanted to. Further, there were seats just outside the lobby where the Accused could sit to escape the cold air as that area was not air-conditioned. Significantly, the Accused had confirmed that he had done just that. He had also confirmed that he had gone to the toilet several times during the wait<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a>. It was therefore clear that the Accused’s freedom had not been unduly restricted, and that he was able to seek respite from the cold, which he had done.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admittedly, the wait endured by the Accused was not of a short duration. I have no doubt that the Accused must have felt some degree of stress because of the wait. However, in light of [15] above, I did not think that the stress was of such a degree that it rendered the statement that he gave to PW4 involuntary and therefore inadmissible. I also did not think that the degree of stress was of such an extent that his free will was sapped when he gave his statement. In this regard, I noted that the Accused himself had confirmed in court that the contents of P1 was correct and he had also affirmed the same in P1<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a>. He admitted that he had signed the declaration at the end of P1 that the statement had been read back to him in Malay and that it was true and correct. He confirmed that if the declaration was not true, he would not have signed it<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the alleged inducement, I accepted PW4’s evidence that he had not informed the Accused that he was only after PW3 and that he would use the Accused as evidence against PW3. It was incongruous for PW4 to have promised the Accused that he would not be charged for the offence when P1 was recorded for the purpose of investigating into the specific offence of dealing with duty unpaid cigarettes. More pertinently, when it was specifically put to the Accused that PW4 had not promised not to charge him in return for his statement, the Accused had replied that he could not recall if PW4 had said this to him. This lack of recall was significant. In my mind, he had on his own accord formed the wrong impression that he was not going to be charged because he was not arrested after he had given P1 and instead was allowed to leave COC after the recording. The Accused had alluded to this mis-impression when it was put to him that he had known he was also being investigated for duty unpaid cigarette-related activities<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All considered, I was satisfied that the Accused had given P1 voluntarily. I therefore admitted P1 into evidence.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Did the Accused receive 20 cartons of Gudang Garam cigarettes and did he know that they were duty unpaid cigarettes?</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW3 testified that on 14 March 2021, the Accused had called him to purchase 20 cartons of duty unpaid Gudang Garam cigarettes from him. He counted the 20 cartons from the lot that he had stored in his bedroom and packed them into a canvas bag that same night in his flat. After that, he had placed the canvas bag on a trolley. Then sometime in the afternoon of 15 March 2021, the Accused had called again to collect the cigarettes. As PW3 was then at work, he had asked PW2 to bring the trolley with the canvas bag to the Accused. PW3 also gave a description of the Accused’s taxi to PW2.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW2’s evidence was consistent with that of PW3’s. PW2 testified that PW3 had called him on his mobile phone and instructed him to pass a canvas duffel bag to a friend. The friend would be waiting at the void deck of their flat. PW2 said the canvas duffel bag was on a trolley in the living room. PW2 pushed the trolley with the canvas duffel bag to the ground floor. At the ground floor, PW2 saw a man waiting. After confirming that the man was PW3’s friend, PW2 pushed the trolley to the boot of the man’s taxi. PW2 then helped the man to load the bag into the boot. PW2 did not know what was inside the canvas duffel bag.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tee Wei Shen (“PW1”) was a Customs officer who had conducted surveillance of PW3’s flat on 15 Mach 2021. At about 5.40 pm that day, he had seen PW2 coming out from the unit pushing a trolley. On the trolley was a canvas bag. About two minutes later, he saw PW2 at the drop off point of the flat. There, he saw PW2 put the canvas bag into the boot of a waiting blue Comfort taxi. PW2 noted the taxi’s registration numbers which was. After that, the taxi drove off and PW2 was seen returning to his unit with the trolley</a></p><a id="p1_21"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused’s account of the events before and on 15 March 2021 in P1 was also very consistent with the accounts set out in the preceding paragraphs. In P1 the Accused had admitted that he was a heavy smoker. He smoked about two to three packets of cigarettes a day. He bought duty unpaid cigarettes as this was a cheaper way of indulging his smoking habit. Initially he made his purchases of these cigarettes at the Geylang area. Sometime in January 2021, the Accused switched to buying duty unpaid cigarettes from PW3. His first two purchases from PW3 comprised 10 cartons each at $70 per carton<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Accused’s account in P1, on 12 March 2021, PW3 had told him that he had 20 cartons of duty unpaid Gudang Garam cigarettes and offered to sell them to him at $60 per carton. The Accused agreed and paid him $1,200 on 13 March 2021<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a>. On 15 March 2021, the Accused had called PW3 to say that he was on his way to PW3’s flat to collect the cigarettes. PW3 told him that he was at work but he would instruct PW2 to deliver the cigarettes to him. PW2 had passed the canvas bag containing the 20 cartons to him at the drop off point at PW3’s flat. The bag was placed inside the boot of his taxi. After that, he drove away. The Accused stated that the cigarettes were for his own consumption<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence as set out above clearly established the following –</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_24-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused had ordered 20 cartons of the Gudang Garam duty unpaid cigarettes from PW3<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused had taken delivery of the 20 cartons of the Gudang Garam cigarettes from PW2.</a></p><a id="p1_24-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW3 had testified that he had packed 20 cartons of the Gudang Garam cigarettes into the canvas bag. Thereafter, the canvas bag was placed on the trolley and left in the flat. The next day, PW2 passed the canvas bag with its contents to the Accused. PW2 confirmed that he had not opened up the canvas bag before he passed it to the Accused. Therefore, I was satisfied that the 20 cartons that PW3 had packed into the canvas bag had not disturbed or tampered with before it was delivered to the Accused.</a></p><a id="p1_25"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The account in P1 clearly showed that the Accused had ordered 20 cartons duty unpaid cigarettes.

The excise duty for one stick of Gudang Garam cigarette as of 15 March 2021 was $0.854 per stick. As such, the total excise duty for the 3,200 sticks was $2,732.80.

In any case, it should be noted that PW3 had in fact been charged with the offence of dealing with more than 200 cartons of duty unpaid Gudang Garam cigarettes.

In my mind, the indicative starting point fell at the lower end of the range ie four and a half months’ imprisonment. However, the fact that he has a similar conviction in 2015 warranted an uplift from the indicative starting point. In my view, an uplift of two weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate. In coming to this conclusion, I took into account that the duty unpaid cigarettes were for his own consumption. I would like to stress that this did not constitute a mitigating factor. Rather, it reduced the egregious nature of the offence, as compared to the situation where he had possessed the cigarettes for sale. If it was the latter, then a higher uplift would have been warranted. For the same reasons, I also was of the view that the fine should fall within the minimum prescribed which was 30 times the excise duty evaded, which came to $81,984, and in default to serve three months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43">43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying the same considerations set out above, I was of the view that the sentence of one month’s imprisonment and the minimum prescribed fine of 30 times the GST duty evaded which was $6,158.10 were appropriate for the GST charge.
