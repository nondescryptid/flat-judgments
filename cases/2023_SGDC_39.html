He was first charged on 14 November 2017 by the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) under Section 22A(1)(a) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91A, 2009 Rev Ed) (“EFMA”) for receiving money from foreign workers as a condition of their employment. The Accused contested the EFMA charges and a trial began on 26 April 2018 in a District Court (“the 1st MOM trial”).</a></p><a id="p1_1"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 27 April 2018, the second day of the 1<sup>st</sup> MOM trial, the Accused decided not to contest the charges and indicated through counsel to plead guilty. He pleaded guilty on the same day and the case was adjourned for Mitigation and Sentencing on 23 May 2018. In the meantime, the Accused changed lawyers and the new defence counsel informed that he had received instructions from the Accused for the Mitigation which would amount to a qualification of the Guilty plea. He therefore applied for a retraction of the plea entered earlier. The District Judge did not allow the plea to be retracted and the Accused was sentenced on 24 May 2018. The Accused filed a petition for revision in the High Court against the decision.</a></p><a id="p1_2"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1 October 2018, the High Court ordered a retrial. A retrial was conducted in another District Court in 2020 before a different District Judge. The Accused was convicted on 20 October 2020 midway through the retrial after he decided to plead guilty to 25 EFMA charges of receiving payments from foreign workers as a condition for employment, with 38 similar EFMA charges taken into consideration for sentencing. He was sentenced to a total fine of $320,000 and ordered to pay a total penalty of $50,000.</a></p><a id="p1_3"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Allegation of bribery</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 22 June 2018, a police report was lodged by the MOM Investigation Officer (PW1 Lim Wee Siong) against the Accused for the offence of bribery of foreign workers to be called as witnesses in the 1<sup>st</sup> MOM trial. PW1 stated he had gathered information from the witnesses that one Zaw Oo (PW2) was instructed by the Accused to “<em>approach the witnesses and offered money to them</em>” [<em>sic</em>]. PW1 also stated in that police report that MOM was of the view that the Accused was “<em>trying to induce the witnesses in the judicial proceeding or offers gratification to them to abstain from giving evidence</em>.” [<em>sic</em>]</a></p><a id="p1_4"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police report gave the date of the alleged incident of attempted bribery as occurring between 20 and 22 April 2018, just before the start of the 1<sup>st</sup> MOM trial.</a></p><a id="p1_5"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused was subsequently charged for <b>instigating</b> PW2 to offer gratification to 7 workers to abstain from giving evidence at the 1<sup>st</sup> MOM trial. On 29 July 2021, the Accused entered a plea of Not Guilty to the 7 charges. After hearing the evidence adduced in the trial and having considered the submissions of the Prosecution and Defence, I was satisfied that the 7 charges were not proven and he was granted an acquittal. I had given brief reasons when delivering the verdict. The Prosecution has filed this appeal against the acquittal. The following are my detailed reasons for the decision.</a></p><a id="p1_6"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prosecution’s Case</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution proceeded on 7 charges under Section 204B(1)(b) read with Section 109 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev Ed). The particulars of the charges in terms of the dates and details are identical save for each name of the individual person to be called as a witness in the 1<sup>st</sup> MOM trial. It suffices to state the nature of the charges as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_7"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“You are charged that you, sometime before 26 April 2018, in Singapore, did abet the commission of an offence of bribery of a witness, to wit, you instigated one Zaw Oo to offer one <em>XXX (name of the foreign worker)</em> gratification of $2,000, upon an understanding that the said <em>XXX</em>, a person to be called as a witness in a judicial proceeding, Case Number SC-910802-2017, to be heard in State Court Number 36 from 26 April 2018 to 27 April 2018, and from 23 May 2018 to 25 May 2018, will abstain from giving evidence, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 204B(1)(b) read with section 109 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev Ed).”</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution’s case is that <b><em>the Accused instigated PW2</em></b> in a phone call to offer seven Myanmar workers gratification of $2,000 each upon an understanding that these workers, who were to be called as witnesses, would abstain from giving evidence in the 1st MOM trial.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DPP submitted that the Prosecution had proven the offences beyond a reasonable doubt based on the evidence led from PW2. PW2 testified that the Accused had called him and told him to gather the workers so that the Accused could meet them. PW2 said that the Accused wanted to pay them $2000 each. The DPP accepted that the credibility of PW2 was impeached by the Defence using PW2’s first statement to the police, in which he had not implicated the Accused. Nevertheless, the DPP urged the Court to accept his Court testimony as the truth.</a></p><a id="p1_9"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution called Nan Lwin Aung (PW3), Hein Min Ko (PW4), Yan Naing Soe (PW5) and Min Khant Thu Rein (PW6) to provide some form of corroboration for PW2’s evidence. Only PW3 and PW4 were workers named in two of the seven charges. PW3 did not have any contact with the Accused but testified that he was told by PW2 to help inform workers to gather at Peninsula Plaza for a meeting. PW4 did not have any working relationship with PW2 or the Accused. He went for the meeting at Peninsula Plaza and met PW2 for the first time. He went to the meeting as he had received a Facebook Messenger message from an unidentified friend informing him of the meeting.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW5 did not have any working interactions with the Accused and did not attend the meeting at Peninsula Plaza. His understanding was that they were to meet there and that the Accused would pay them $2,000. As part of the Prosecution’s case, there were tendered in evidence out-of-court statements of several foreign workers pursuant to section 32(1)(j)(iii) of the Evidence Act 1893 as their attendance could not be secured for the trial.</a></p><a id="p1_11"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Defence’s Case</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence’s position against the charges was that the Accused had not given any instructions to PW2 to offer bribes to the foreign workers. The Accused was not aware that PW2 had offered bribes to the witnesses to be called for the 1st MOM trial. If indeed bribes had been offered to the workers by PW2 and in the manner that he did, PW2 had done so without the knowledge of the Accused.</a></p><a id="p1_12"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence submitted that if PW2 had arranged the meeting of the workers at Peninsula Plaza, PW2 did not inform the Accused about the meeting or about what PW2 intended to discuss with the workers at such a meeting. In the statement that PW2 gave to the police on 6 August 2018 (admitted as evidence in court and marked as Exhibit D7), PW2 had admitted that he did not inform the Accused about the meeting that he had arranged for the workers. The Defence submitted that not only had PW2’s credibility been successfully impeached, the evidence of the witnesses PW3, PW4, PW5 and PW6 was not credible and was not corroborative of PW2’s evidence.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Key Issue</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This case turns on the evidence of the key witness PW2. The Accused is charged for abetment by <b><em>instigating</em></b> PW2 to offer bribes to the seven workers in the meeting at the Peninsula Plaza. The Accused was not present at that meeting. Therefore, PW2 is the vital link in the whole chain of events. If it is shown that PW2 is not a credible witness or that the evidence he had given of what the Accused told him to do is not reliable or unclear, there would be grave doubts cast on the charges that the Accused had <b><em>instigated</em></b> PW1 to commit the offences. The evidence of the workers would not be independent objective corroboration as it emanated from the impressions given to them by PW2.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the evidence adduced at trial and the respective closing submissions of the Prosecution and the Defence, the key issue of this case is whether the Accused did instruct PW2 in a phone call to bribe the workers and the determination of this key issue hinged on:</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_15-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW2 having made an offer of $2000 as gratification to each one of the 7 workers named in each one of the 7 charges against the Accused.</a></p><a id="p1_15-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_15-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offer was made for the purpose of the workers abstaining from giving evidence at the 1<sup>st</sup> MOM trial.</a></p><a id="p1_15-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_15-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether PW2’s testimony that he was told by the Accused to gather the workers and make the offer is reliable.</a></p><a id="p1_15-p2_c"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Court Findings</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Meeting at Peninsula Plaza </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept the Prosecution’s submissions that the evidence adduced from the witnesses proved there was a meeting held at the Peninsula Plaza. I reject the submissions of the Defence that there was no such meeting and that the witnesses had fabricated it. I agreed with the Prosecution that there was no basis to say that the workers who had turned up for the meeting arranged by PW2 would lie about the meeting they had attended. Any allegations of a conspiracy to frame the Accused was baseless.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the fact that the meeting did take place would not prove that the Accused had asked PW2 to organise it and to offer gratification to them. There were difficulties in the evidence to pin down how and why the workers were being gathered. These difficulties were:</a></p><a id="p1_17"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_17-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no clear and concrete evidence as to what messages were sent out in calling for the meeting and by whom. Despite there being 13 witnesses to be gathered for the meeting of which 7 of these 13 attended, there is not even a screenshot or trace of the messages received by the witnesses. All the witnesses who testified at trial that they had received the messages had either deleted the messages or somehow lost them. Furthermore, their recollection of what was in the messages was rather sketchy and could not be relied upon by the court to make a proper finding of what the actual texts in these messages were. The precise wording of the texts is critical, bearing in mind that what were purportedly in the texts could implicate or exonerate the Accused. There is also the concern that the texts bore the hallmarks of hearsay and inadmissible evidence since the sender or senders of those messages could not be positively identified or called as witnesses to confirm what had been sent or relayed to the workers individually or collectively.</a></p><a id="p1_17-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_17-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the alleged offer of a payment of $2000, was it to return them the money each of them should not have paid or for them not to attend the 1<sup>st</sup> MOM trial or to go back to Myanmar or to meet the lawyer of the Accused to discuss what to say in Court? It was not clear which if any or all of these were the purposes of the offer.</a></p><a id="p1_17-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_17-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the witnesses who had attended the meeting, their evidence was unclear as to what was said precisely - who had said what and why. There was no coherent evidence as to the sequence of the various conversations, what they were told, what exactly was asked or discussed and if there were any clarifications provided and by whom.</a></p><a id="p1_17-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vagueness and the inconsistencies of the witnesses on what had transpired were troubling aspects of the Prosecution’s case against the Accused. This was particularly of concern since the Accused was not at the meeting. More significantly, instead of providing corroboration to PW2’s evidence that he was acting on the instructions of the Accused, it was equally plausible for the meeting to have been called by PW2 on his own volition, in his attempts to be a “peacemaker” in the disputes that some of the workers had with their employer. This was what PW2 had alluded to in his first police statement. At Paragraphs 5 and 6 of PW2’s first police statement (Exhibit D7), he stated as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_18"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;… and thus I talked to Nan Lwing Aung, I told him I wanted to talk about this case. I asked Nan Lwing Aung if he know who are the Myanmar workers and to spread the message that I wanted to meet them at Peninsula Plaza to find out what happened. …</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not inform Dinesh that there is this meeting that I arranged and I turned up at the Peninsula Plaza. There are a total of 7 or 8 workers … turned up. I asked them what is the problem and they said about the SGD$2,000 case and is a problem as till now have not finished. I asked them back if they get back the SGD$2,000 is the case solved. If they can get the SGD$2,000, the case will finish and they also can go back Myanmar. After that, they talked about how to spend the SGD$2,000 while we are eating, after finished our meal, we went back to our ship.” (<em>sic</em>)</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="">PW2’s description in Exhibit D7 of what had transpired at the Peninsula Plaza meeting appeared to be more aligned with the testimonies given by the other witnesses as to how the meeting went than PW2’s court testimony.</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the vagueness and inconsistencies have been comprehensively covered by the Defence Closing Submissions (at Paragraphs 65, 67, 70-73, 168-173 and the Annex A comparison table) and Defence Reply Submissions (at Paragraphs 10, 14, 20, 21, 22, 23, 51, 53, 64). I need only highlight a few examples:</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_19-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution witnesses had differing accounts as to the date of the meeting. None was certain as to when it was supposed to take place from the time they were informed of the meeting. The estimations of the witnesses ranged from one day to several days. This is a material and significant point as PW2’s evidence is that the Accused told him to gather the workers to meet him the next day at 3.00 p.m. That did not leave very much time to gather the workers and this contrasted sharply with the evidence of the witnesses. It seemed that the workers worked on different vessels and needed time for permissions to be obtained to leave the ships and for the various disembarkation arrangements to be made.</a></p><a id="p1_19-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_19-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW4 testified that PW2 only mentioned that the Accused would pay $2000 for all of them not to go to court and that PW2 did not say anything about going back to Myanmar or about meeting the lawyer of the Accused. PW4’s understanding was that it was PW2 who had proposed returning the $2000 and not on the instructions of the Accused.</a></p><a id="p1_19-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_19-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW3 testified that PW2 told everyone that the Accused wanted to return the $2000 and they can take the money and go home. PW3 also testified that it was PW2 who requested them not to go to court. PW3 did not confirm that he had heard PW2 say that it was the Accused who had instructed PW2 to tell them not to go to court.</a></p><a id="p1_19-p2_c"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Unreliability of PW2 cast grave doubts on the element of instigation</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is PW2 such a critical witness for the Prosecution? It is simply because it is the Prosecution’s case that he had been told unequivocally by the Accused to bribe the witnesses who were supposed to attend the 1<sup>st</sup> MOM trial. He is the only one who the Accused instructed on what to do and when to do it.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW2’s evidence at trial was that the Accused had called him sometime in April 2018 and told him that the Accused wanted to pay the workers $2000 each. According to PW2, the payment was for one of three purposes – not to attend court as a witness, go back to Myanmar or meet the lawyer of the Accused to discuss what to say in court. The Accused told PW2 that Mahzuz (PW8) would hand a list of witnesses to him. The Accused instructed him to contact the workers on the list and tell the workers to meet the Accused at the office the next day at 3.00 p.m.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW2’s vagueness as to when the call had taken place is telling. Particularly when you consider that the events after the call did not gel with the instructions that were supposedly given by the Accused in the call.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the call had occurred just the day before the meeting at Peninsula Plaza, it would have required PW2 to be able, within a very short space of time, to get the workers released from the ships they were separately in. To do that, PW2 would have to be able to know who and where they were. Yet, we find from the evidence of the workers that it took time to identify the workers, to see if they were able and willing to attend the meeting and to get permission for the workers to be released by their ship captains and to arrange for transport for each worker to be able to go ashore to attend the meeting.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a clear motive in court for PW2 to push the blame onto the Accused as being the person who instigated him to call for the meeting. PW2 himself admitted that he was a person who would avoid being implicated out of fear and give false information. Although he said he decided to come clean after giving the first police statement (Exhibit D7), after he had spoken to his family, the converse could easily be true, in that he realised that he might have committed an offence and decided to save himself by implicating the Accused. I agreed with the Defence Counsel on this point – that it did not make sense for him to have implicated himself in the first police statement D7 out of fear of being implicated.</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The logical inference and sequence would have been that he had told the truth in the first instance and, after speaking to his family, he became fearful and decided to implicate the Accused. It was more likely that PW2 did not intend to bribe the workers and was not told by the Accused to do so. That was why he readily admitted that he was the one who had proposed the idea of the workers getting back the $2000 from the Accused to resolve the MOM case in his first police statement D7. He did not think that he had committed any offence or done anything wrong.</a></p><a id="p1_25"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently after having given the first police statement, he realised that he had unwittingly given the impression to the workers that he was offering a bribe by suggesting they get back their money from the Accused, money for which they should not have paid in the first place. Thus, he became fearful and implicated the Accused. This can be gleaned from his cross-examination:</a></p><a id="p1_26"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you are trying to say that you thought that your culpability as a translator would have been higher than by you giving this statement, saying that you had arranged for everything?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, this is what I thought.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. I will put it to you, Mr. Zaw, that your explanation on this inconsistency is unbelievable. The explanation that you have just given, it is unbelievable. Do you agree or disagree?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to say that if I had known earlier what you just said, that if I just told them exactly the translation or whatever, that would have been less of an issue for me than this, I would have told them that. I did not know.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another pertinent evidence that points to the inconsistency of PW2’s testimony is that which related to the meeting being cancelled by the Accused. As highlighted by the Defence Counsel, why would the Accused cancel the meeting after all the arrangements had been made by PW2? The abrupt end to the meeting seemed to be more in line with the Accused’s evidence that PW2 had called him out of the blue to head to Peninsula Plaza. This caught the Accused by surprise and he had to refrain from meeting them as he had been told by his lawyer not to contact the workers.</a></p><a id="p1_27"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would explain the more likely scenario that it was PW2 who had called for the meeting and when the Accused did not want to meet them, PW2 had to tell the workers that the Accused was not going to meet them at Peninsula Plaza. Bear in mind that PW2 had earlier testified that the meeting was supposed to be at the office at 3.00 p.m. and he was instructed to bring the workers to meet the Accused at the office. None of the workers seemed to be aware of this.</a></p><a id="p1_28"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW2 also lied on a very important issue regarding when he had deleted his messages on the Facebook Messenger App. He initially claimed that the Facebook messages should still be in his phone but his phone was with the police. After his phone was produced, it was revealed that the Facebook Messenger App was not even on his phone. He then changed his evidence and claimed that the IO Police Inspector Lee Mei Qi (PW9) had allowed him to delete the Facebook messenger application. IO Lee Mei Qi confirmed that PW2 lied about this.</a></p><a id="p1_29"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the key material witness for the Prosecution is PW2. The Prosecution rightly conceded that his credibility as a witness was impeached. He testified that he had lied to the Police on 6 August 2018 when he was interviewed by IO Lee Mei Qi. In this statement D7, he said that he initiated the meeting at Peninsula Plaza through PW3. He also said that he had asked the workers if the case would be solved if they got back their $2,000. He said that he did not tell the workers not to attend court and that he was willing to go for a polygraph test. PW2 changed his position completely at trial from that police statement. He did not provide a coherent explanation for this abrupt <em>volte-face</em>. It is not that PW2 was simply inconsistent on peripheral matters in his first police statement and his testimony in court. It is not uncommon for witnesses to be inconsistent in their statements and court testimonies but when the inconsistent parts touched on the very foundation upon which the conviction must rest on, then it is fatal.</a></p><a id="p1_30"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Other material uncertainties</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the evidence of what transpired at the meeting was unable to provide us with a clear picture of what was said by PW2 precisely to the workers. The witnesses were giving evidence of their impressions of what the meeting was about instead of clear testimonies of what was specifically spoken by PW2 and whether there were any responses from the workers to what was conveyed to them or clarifications from PW2 on what was said to them.</a></p><a id="p1_31"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also unclear whether the Accused was supposed to be there to meet the workers and why. If PW2 was supposed to convey and offer bribes to the workers at the Peninsula Plaza meeting, why was there a need to bring the workers to meet up with the Accused at the office at 3.00 p.m.? It is also important to note that none of the so-called corroborative witnesses mention anything about being told that they were to meet the Accused at 3.00 p.m. at the office.</a></p><a id="p1_32"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW2 had shown himself to be a person who is eager to provide help and do things on his own initiative to the extent of secretly recording an earlier conversation amongst Myanmar workers to find out about problematic fellow workers. He came across as being very interested in ensuring that the Myanmar workers would not be seen to be causing trouble and he was prepared to identify troublemakers to be dealt with.</a></p><a id="p1_33"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called corroboration in the evidence of the other witnesses that the Prosecution suggested could salvage its case did not prove to be so. It would be tenuous to rely on these witnesses as their evidence emanated from PW2 and was not independent objective corroboration. Based on the evidence adduced at trial, my findings on the 3 sub-issues are therefore:</a></p><a id="p1_34"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34"></a><a id="p1_34-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW2 <b>did mention</b> the amount of $2000 to the workers at the Peninsula Plaza meeting. However, it was <b>not clear to all present that the $2000 was meant to be a bribe</b>.</a></p><a id="p1_34-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_34-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not clear that the offer was made for the purpose of the workers abstaining from giving evidence at the 1<sup>st</sup> MOM trial.</a></p><a id="p1_34-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_34-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>PW2’s testimony</b> that he was told by the Accused to gather the workers and to make the offer on behalf of the Accused <b>is not reliable</b>.</a></p><a id="p1_34-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34-p2_c"></a><a id="">Therefore, my finding on the main issue of whether the Accused did instruct PW2 to bribe the workers is that the Prosecution had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused did so.</a></p><a id=""> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons given above, the evidence as presented at trial in this case was plainly unsafe to record a conviction against the Accused as charged. At the end of the day, the Accused could not be convicted as the key witness PW2 is not a credible witness and his evidence lacked consistency and clarity on the essential element of <b>instigation</b>. There might be some corroboration of parts of PW2’s testimony but that limited corroboration was not enough to remove the considerable doubts raised by the Defence against this pivotal witness. The burden is not on the Accused to prove his innocence. Whatever question marks the DPP could raise against the Defence’s evidence were unable to overcome the doubts cast on the Prosecution’s case.</a></p><a id="p1_35"> </a></div></content></html>
