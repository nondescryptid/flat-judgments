The plaintiff initiated a claim against the developer and contractor of a development, seeking damages for defects in his property within the development. About a year after the action was initiated, the contractor applied to strike out the plaintiff’s claim, arguing that he had no <em>locus standi</em> to continue pursuing the claim as he had failed to join his wife, a joint tenant of the property, as a co-plaintiff. In a bid to cure the “defect”, the plaintiff applied to amend his pleadings to join his wife as a party. The defendants fervently resist the amendment, arguing that it would irremediably prejudice their accrued limitation defence.</a></p><a id="p1_1"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2011, Mr Loo Kim Chwee (“the Purchaser”) and his wife, Mdm Koh Siew Cheek (“Mdm Koh”) entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) to purchase a strata house within a development known as Thomson Grand (“the Development”) from Luxury Green Development Pte Ltd (“the Developer”).</a></p><a id="p1_2"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development was issued its Temporary Occupation Permit (“TOP”) on 16 October 2015,<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a> and the Purchaser received the Notice of Vacant Possession (“NVP”) in November 2015.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 of the SPA provided that within “12 months from the date the Purchaser receives the [NVP] in respect of the Unit”, the Purchaser had the right to notify the Developer of the defects in the Unit. Within one month of receiving a notice from the Purchaser of such defects, the Developer “must make good any such defect”, failing which the Purchaser would have the right to cause the rectification works to be carried out and to recover the cost of the rectification works from the Developer (“the Defects Liability Clause”).</a></p><a id="p1_4"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Purchaser took possession of his purchased property (“the Property”) around December 2015, and began to reside there in June 2016.

As regards the amendment for the latent defects, it is submitted that this should also not be allowed because this claim only accrued after the commencement of the action, and so the Purchaser ought to commence a fresh action in respect of those defects.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues arising from the two applications are as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_11"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_11-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, whether the Purchaser has <em>locus standi</em> to commence the claim in his sole capacity as one of two joint tenants of the Property.

Each joint tenant holds nothing by himself; he holds the whole estate with the other joint tenants” (<em>Chan Lung Kien v Chan Shwe Ching</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21928-SSP.xml')">[2018] 4 SLR 208</a> at [29]). As a consequence of the manner of their holding, joint tenants must act jointly to bind their estate (<em>Goh Teh Lee v Lim Li Pheng Maria and others</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 3 SLR 0364.xml')">[2010] 3 SLR 364</a> (“<em>Goh Teh Lee</em>”) at [17]):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Since the interest of each joint tenant is the same in extent, nature and duration, a necessary consequence is <b>that each and every joint tenant must partake in any dealings with the whole legal estate before such dealings may effectively bind the entire estate</b>. An action by one joint tenant, or even by some joint tenants but short of all of them collectively, will not suffice to bind the estate, as the whole estate does not reside in the single joint tenant or the select few (as the case may be).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Arising from the requirement that joint tenants must act jointly before the estate may be bound by their actions is the rule that <em>in cases involving actions as to the joint estate, one joint tenant may not sue or be sued without joining the others</em>” [emphasis added] (<em>Goh Teh Lee</em> at [21]). This is echoed in <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em> vol 14 (LexisNexis, 2023 Reissue) at para 170.0035:</a></p><a id="p1_15"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">In actions as to the joint estate <em>one joint tenant may not sue or be sued without joining the others</em>, and a judgment for possession against one joint tenant is not an effective judgment.

In <em>Goh Teh Lee</em>, the appellant lacked <em>locus standi</em> to appeal against the Strata Titles Board’s decision to grant an order for the collective sale of a development because his ex-wife, a co-owner of his unit within the development, had agreed to the collective sale.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Action improperly commenced in the Purchaser’s sole name</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to the facts here, the Purchaser’s claim against the Defendants is for damages caused by the Alleged Defects in the Property that he jointly holds with Mdm Koh, who is at present <em>not</em> a party to the proceedings.</a></p><a id="p1_17"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is closely analogous to the case of <em>Williams v British Gas Corporation</em> [1981] 1 EGLR 165 (“<em>Williams</em>”), an authority that was followed by the Court of Appeal in <em>Goh Teh Lee</em> (at 366). In <em>Williams</em>, the claimant brought a claim against the defendant for the pollution of lakes which allegedly depreciated the value of his property. According to the claimant, the corporation was negligent, and he wished to claim against them under Part I of the Land Compensation Act 1973 (UK). The tribunal found that he lacked the <em>locus standi</em> to commence or maintain the claim against the defendant because, among others, he had failed to join his wife, the joint owner of the property, as a claimant (at 165):</a></p><a id="p1_18"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[The claimant] said that his wife was not willing to be joined with him as claimant.

In his affidavit for the Amendment Summons, he candidly admits that the amendment to include his wife “would allow [him] to correct the present defect in the Writ of Summons … and stave off a challenge by the Defendants as to whether [he has] <em>locus standi</em> to bring the present claim.”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before me, counsel for the Purchaser, Mr Lam Kuet Keng Steven John (“Mr Lam”) also admitted that based on the authorities, the Purchaser has “no <em>locus standi</em> to commence [the] action in his own name alone”. I was not pointed to any cases that have detracted from the consistent line of authorities summarised above, which speak singularly in supporting the Defendants’ submission that unless and until all the joint tenants are parties to the proceedings, the claim in respect of their property (jointly held) simply cannot proceed. Indeed, in <em>Williams</em>, after the tribunal observed that the claim “must be struck out unless [the claimant’s wife,] Mrs Williams[,] be joined as a claimant with her husband”, they proceeded to make clear that the claimant would be given time for such a course to be taken (<em>Williams</em> at 166). As such, I turn to consider whether the Purchaser can join his wife as a co-plaintiff.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Purchaser’s wife can be joined as a party</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Joinder of party under an amendment application</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To join his wife, the Purchaser has taken out the Amendment Summons, seeking leave to amend the Writ of Summons to add Mdm Koh as the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff pursuant to O 20 r 5(1) of the Rules of Court 2014 (“ROC 2014”).</a></p><a id="p1_21"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An “amendment” to join parties was also sought in <em>Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 3322 v Mer Vue Developments Pte Ltd</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19266-SSP.xml')">[2016] 4 SLR 351</a> (“<em>Mer Vue (CA)</em>”). There, the management corporation (“MCST”) brought proceedings against the developer of the condominium for building defects. Midway during the proceedings, the MCST sought to amend the further and better particulars to add another 113 subsidiary proprietors. This amendment would significantly increase the damages recoverable by the MCST if the contractual cause of action succeeded. However, by the time the amendment application was filed, the contractual claim was time-barred, and so the High Court judge disallowed the amendment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In upholding the decision to bar the addition of the 113 subsidiary proprietors, the Court of Appeal observed that the proposed amendment was in substance a joinder of 113 new parties (<em>Mer Vue (CA)</em> at [19]). Given that “[t]he court would not allow the joinder of a claimant as a party if the relevant limitation period of that claim has expired at the time of the application” (<em>Mer Vue (CA)</em> at [18]), the proposed “amendment” to add the 113 subsidiary proprietors could not be permitted.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in <em>Mer Vue (CA)</em>, the effect of the proposed amendment to add Mdm&nbsp;Koh is to join her as a party to the action. In the circumstances, O 15 r 6 of ROC 2014, which provides for the joinder of parties, is the applicable provision (see <em>Mer Vue (CA)</em> at [15]). This is so even though the Amendment Summons also engages O&nbsp;20 r 5 because the Purchaser has sought to add a claim for latent defects, which he says surfaced sometime in May 2022, after the present claim had been commenced; as the court observed in <em>Mer Vue (CA)</em> at [12], “it is possible for a set of proposed amendments to engage <em>both</em> [O 15 r&nbsp;6 and O 20 r 5 of ROC 2014] … in so far as the amendment constituted both a joinder of new parties and an amendment of pleadings” [emphasis added].</a></p><a id="p1_24"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The rule on joinder is subject to limitation</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court’s denial of the “amendment” to include additional parties after the expiry of the limitation period in <em>Mer Vue (CA)</em> is not unique.</a></p><a id="p1_25"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the earlier case of <em>Abdul Gaffer bin Fathil v Chua Kwang Yong</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1994] 3 SLR(R) 1056.xml')">[1994] 3 SLR(R) 1056</a> (“<em>Abdul Gaffer</em>”), the court similarly barred the joinder of a claimant after the limitation period had expired. There, the plaintiff, who was involved in a road accident, initially commenced proceedings against the employer of the driver who caused the collision only. During the trial, the driver admitted that he had been negligent, and the plaintiff thus sought to add the driver as a co-defendant. Disallowing the application, the Court of Appeal held that “[u]ntil limitation stepped in, it was a matter of choice for the [plaintiff] to decide whether to sue the [driver]”. However, O 15 r 6(2) was subject to, and did not override limitation. Hence, it was not “necessary” to add the driver as a defendant (<em>Abdul Gaffer</em> at [16]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Ernest Ferdinand Perez De La Sala v Compania De Navegacion Palomar, SA and others and other appeals</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21824-SSP.xml')">[2018] 1 SLR 894</a> (“<em>Ernest Ferdinand</em>”), the Court of Appeal broke down the elements of O 15 r 6(2)(<em>b</em>) of ROC 2014 into two separate stages. For ease of reference, the provision is set out:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the provisions of this Rule, at any stage of the proceedings in any cause or matter, the Court may, on such terms as it thinks just and either of its own motion or on application —</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;order any of the following persons to be added as a party, namely:</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any person who ought to have been joined as a party or whose presence before the Court is <b><em>necessary </em></b><em>to ensure that all matters in the cause or matter may be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon</em>;</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any person between whom and any party to the cause or matter there may exist a question or issue arising out of or relating to or connected with any relief or remedy claimed in the cause or matter which in the opinion of the Court it would be <b><em>just and convenient </em></b><em>to determine as between him and that party as well as between the parties to the cause or matter</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the court, O 15 r 6(2)(<em>b</em>) contains two alternate bases to add parties. Both sub-para (i) (“the necessity limb”) and sub-para (ii) (“the just and equitable limb”) are controlled by a non-discretionary requirement that the joinder be done “at any stage of the proceedings”, meaning that the power to add a party only exists if “something still remains to be done in a case” (<em>Ernest Ferdinand</em> at [195] and [202]). Once this threshold is crossed, and regardless of whether the necessity limb or the just and equitable limb is relied upon, the court must “consider all the factors which are relevant to the balance of justice in a particular case” in deciding whether the joinder should be allowed (<em>Ernest Ferdinand</em> at [205]).</a></p><a id="p1_28"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saliently, the court highlighted the importance of the applicable limitation period, holding that “[w]here the claim by or against the party sought to be joined is time-barred at the date of application, joinder will <b><em>not</em></b> be allowed” [emphasis added] (<em>Ernest Ferdinand</em> at [206], citing <em>Abdul Gaffer</em> at [16] and <em>Mer Vue (CA)</em> at [18]). This is because “the rule on joinder of parties in O 15 r 6(2) [of ROC 2014] is ‘subject to limitation’ and should not be applied to ‘override the limitation period’” (<em>Mer Vue (CA)</em> at [18], citing <em>Abdul Gaffer</em> at [16]).</a></p><a id="p1_29"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the decisions in <em>Mer Vue (CA), Abdul Gaffer</em>, and <em>Ernest Ferdinand</em>, Mr Lam conceded that <em>if</em> the Purchaser’s claims are time-barred, he would not be able to join his wife as a co-plaintiff to “rectify the defect” in his cause papers.</a></p><a id="p1_30"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the claim is time-barred</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendants submit that the six-year limitation period for the Purchaser’s claim began to run, at the latest, from 16 October 2015, when the TOP was issued.

In suggesting that the date of TOP was the appropriate reference point, Chan J observed as follows (<em>Mer Vue (HC)</em> at [33]):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Clearly, the alleged contractual breaches of design and construction duties would necessarily have occurred during the design and construction phases of the development process, <em>before</em> the issuance of TOP, NVP or CSC.

However, the date that the TOP was granted would probably be the last conceivable date of the alleged contractual breaches by [the developer] and thus could be taken as the <em>latest</em> possible date of accrual of the contractual actions by the additional subsidiary proprietors.

According to Mr Lam, before the DLP expired, any breach would not have crystallised as, pursuant to the Defects Liability Clause, the Developer would have the opportunity to rectify any defects upon notice by the Purchaser. Put another way, it is submitted that the Purchaser was “precluded from commencing action against the Defendants prior to the expiry of the DLP ([during which] the Defendants were given the opportunity to rectify the defects in the Property)”.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a> In my judgment, this is misconceived.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Sandy Island Pte Ltd v Thio Keng Thay</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25198-SSP.xml')">[2020] 2 SLR 1089</a> (“<em>Sandy Island</em>”), the Court of Appeal considered a similar defects liability clause. As in this case, clause 17 of the sale and purchase agreement there required the developer to make good any defects that became apparent within the DLP of 12 months. The court recognised the practical utility of defects liability clauses, noting that “[p]rior to the introduction of these kinds of clauses, contractors had no right to return to site to rectify defects” (<em>Sandy Island</em> at [43]). Nonetheless, such clauses are not a “complete code that will cater for <em>all</em> defects” because, for example, a “defects liability clause does not cover latent defects or defects that will manifest after the DLP” [emphasis in original] (<em>Sandy Island</em> at&nbsp;[48]). Defects liability clauses thus provide an <em>additional right</em> or source of remedies for an aggrieved party, and are not intended to be <em>in substitution for the common law rights</em> to sue for damages upon discovery of defects during the DLP (<em>Sandy Island</em> at [69] and [70]):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[<em>Hudson’s Building and Engineering Contracts</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 11th Ed, 1994)] stated, at para 5-053, that in the absence of express provision, the remedies under maintenance clauses were <b>in addition to, and not in substitution of the common law rights</b>:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">It is always a question of construction whether the rights under the maintenance clause are intended to supplant the right to damages at common law altogether.

Here, there was no legal impediment in the SPA or otherwise that precluded the Purchaser from suing for damages discovered during the DLP while <em>simultaneously</em> notifying the Developer of the defects and seeking rectification of the same. If the Developer failed to rectify the defects upon notification, this would constitute a <em>separate</em> breach of the Defects Liability Clause, provided the notifications were made during the DLP.

In other words, the <em>latest date</em> that the Original Breaches could occur was on the date the NVP was issued. From that date, construction activities would have ceased, although the Purchaser could, within the DLP, issue notices of defects of the Original Breaches. Upon such notice, the Developer would be obliged to rectify the defects within one month of the notice, failing which the Developer could be <em>additionally</em> liable for rectification costs incurred by the Purchaser.</a></p><a id="p1_43"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a><a id="p1_44">44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognise that Chan J then went on to observe that “[e]ven if I were to take the Plaintiff’s case at its highest and considered either the date of legal completion … or the date of the expiry of the 12 months defects liability period … as relevant, the limitation period would still have expired” (<em>Mer Vue (HC)</em> at [34]). In my judgment, the words “even if” clearly demonstrate that his Honour was not regarding the later dates as the proper reference points for when the contractual cause of action accrued. Rather, he was explaining that <em>even if</em> he took the latest possible date of accrual, namely the expiry of the DLP, the time-bar would still have set in. That this was not intended to defer the date of accrual of the contractual cause of action is made eminently clear by the preceding paragraph, where Chan J had <em>already concluded</em> that “the date that the TOP was granted would probably be the last conceivable date of the alleged contractual breaches by [the developer] and thus could be taken as the <em>latest</em> possible date of accrual of the contractual actions by the additional subsidiary proprietors” [emphasis in original] (<em>Mer Vue (HC)</em> at [33]).</a></p><a id="p1_44"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a><a id="p1_45">45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Development received its TOP on 16 October 2015,<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a> and the Purchaser received the NVP in respect of his Property in November 2015, the cause of action for the Original Breaches would have accrued, at the latest, by November 2015.

The damage was only discovered by the plaintiffs in November 1977, and it was found that they could not with reasonable diligence have discovered it before October 1972. In October 1978, the plaintiffs commenced a claim against the defendants for, among others, damages for negligence in relation to the design of the chimney.

In that case, the development was completed in 2003. Between 2004 and 2005, the MCST began making complaints to the contractor of the development about defects around the development caused by sinking ground. In 2007, the MCST engaged a surveyor to produce a report on the problem of soil settlement, and a report was produced in July 2007. Subsequently, in 2009, the MCST commenced proceedings against the developer, and in 2013, they sought to join the contractor as a co-defendant. This was disallowed by an assistant registrar, and the decision was upheld by Woo Bih Li J (as he then was), who held that the tortious claim against the contractor was time-barred (<em>GBI Realty</em> at [27]):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">On the strength of <em>Pirelli</em>, it is likely that the cause of action accrued as early as 30 March 2004.

But taking the MCST’s case at its highest, the damage must have come into existence, at the latest, by the date Mr Casimir conducted the site inspection on 29 May 2007.

In this regard, it is important to recall the difference between the date of <em>materialisation</em> of the defect and the date the defect becomes <em>discoverable</em>; the tortious cause of action accrues from the date of materialisation, not discoverability: see <em>Pirelli</em> ([51] <em>supra</em>).</a></p><a id="p1_55"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a><a id="p1_56">56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As explained in <em>Mer Vue (HC)</em> ([37] <em>supra</em>) at [33], it is likely that any defects in construction would have occurred during the design and construction phases of the development process, which <em>precedes</em> the issuance of the TOP. Hence, it is likely that the defects arose even <em>before</em> the TOP was issued in October 2015. Considering that the damage is suffered when “defects manifest themselves in the form of physical damage to the building” (<em>Dragages</em> ([50] <em>supra</em>) at [480]), it is likely that the damage was suffered on or around the date of TOP in October&nbsp;2015.</a></p><a id="p1_56"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a><a id="p1_57">57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is irrelevant in this regard that the Purchaser only moved into the Property around June 2016.

As explained in <em>Lian Kok Hong</em> ([36] <em>supra</em>) at [42], the requisite knowledge for the time to begin running under s 24A(3)(<em>b</em>) is simply that the plaintiff must know the factual essence of his complaint.

Applying the extended limitation period in s&nbsp;24A(3)(<em>b</em>), the three-year limitation period for the claims for latent defects (if any) would similarly expire by January 2021, more than a year before he took out the Amendment Summons.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60">60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the Purchaser’s Tortious Claims are time-barred pursuant to ss 6(1)(<em>a</em>) and/or 24A(3)(<em>b</em>) of the Limitation Act.</a></p><a id="p1_60"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a><a id="p1_61">61&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the operation of the time-bar in respect of both the Contractual and Tortious Claims, I agree with the Defendants that the belated application to join the Purchaser’s wife as a co-plaintiff cannot be allowed. To do so would be to effectively allow the Purchaser to prosecute his Contractual and Tortious Claims when such claims would be time-barred if brought under a new writ, irremediably prejudicing the Defendants’ limitation defence (<em>Mer Vue (CA)</em> ([22] <em>supra</em>) at [48(<em>a</em>)]).</a></p><a id="p1_61"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Purchaser can add a claim for latent defects</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a><a id="p1_62">62&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final prong of the Purchaser’s Amendment Summons is to add a claim for latent defects, which allegedly arose on or about the end of May 2022, when he discovered a water leakage from the jacuzzi balancing tank on the Property.</a></p><a id="p1_62"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a><a id="p1_63">63&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment, the Developer submits, is an ill-disguised attempt to “hook” a claim that is <em>not</em> time-barred onto the more critical amendment of joining Mdm Koh as a party to cure the Contractual and Tortious Claims.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a> Be that as it may, I proceed to consider whether such an amendment should be allowed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64">64&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Singapore Civil Procedure</em> vol 1 (Cavinder Bull, gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2021) at para 20/8/3, it is noted that an amendment to pleadings “takes effect, not from the date when the amendment is made, but from the date of the original document which it amends”. Because of this, “a plaintiff may not amend his writ by adding a cause of action which has accrued to him since the issue of the writ”.</a></p><a id="p1_64"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a><a id="p1_65">65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This principle that a party cannot introduce a cause of action which did not exist at the date of the writ emanates from the decision of <em>Eshelby v Federated European Bank, Limited</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/English/57050-E-M.xml')">[1932] 1 KB 254</a> (“<em>Eshelby</em>”). There, the plaintiff commenced a writ in November 1930, seeking payment of a first instalment from the defendant. Subsequently, in March 1931, the referee granted the plaintiff leave to amend his claim to add the amount of a second instalment which fell due in January 1931. Reversing the referee’s decision to allow the amendment for the second instalment claim, Swift J noted (at 262):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The Court has amended the statement of claim which is endorsed upon the writ, but it has not amended the writ itself; and, indeed, it could not have done so, because in order to make this action on the second instalment one which would come within the writ, the date of the writ would have had to be altered from November 27, 1930, upon which it was issued and soon after it was served, up to some date after January 15, 1931[, when the second instalment fell due]. I do not think the Court could possibly alter the writ in that way. …</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66">66&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rule in <em>Eshelby</em> was endorsed by the Court of Appeal in <em>The “Jarguh Sawit</em>” </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1997] 3 SLR(R) 0829.xml')">[1997] 3 SLR(R) 829</a> (“<em>Jarguh Sawit</em>”), where it was held (at [58]) that “a new cause of action may not be introduced if it arises after the date of the writ”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67">67&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This position was subsequently doubted in <em>Galistan Gerard Clive Martin trading as Rick’s Technical Services v L &amp; M Prestressing Pte Ltd</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/4341-M.xml')">[1999] SGHC 77</a> (“<em>Galistan</em>”). In that case, Lim Teong Qwee JC observed that the House of Lords had in <em>Ketteman and others v Hansel Properties Ltd and others</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/English/68430-E-M.xml')">[1987] 1 AC 189</a> observed (at 220) that “[w]hether an amendment should be granted is a matter for the discretion of the trial judge and he should be guided in the exercise of the discretion by his assessment of where justice lies”. Accordingly, Lim JC formed the view that “the ‘rule’ in the <em>Eshelby</em> case is inconsistent with these developments and I think it is no longer valid” (<em>Galistan</em> at [12]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68">68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the observation in <em>Galistan</em>, the rule in <em>Eshelby</em> remains applicable in Singapore. <em>Galistan</em>, as can be observed, was a High Court decision, whereas <em>Jarguh Sawit</em> was a decision of the Court of Appeal. While the apex court was subsequently invited to review the correctness of <em>Jarguh Sawit</em> and its endorsement of <em>Eshelby</em> in <em>Chuang Uming (Pte) Ltd v Setron Ltd</em> [2000] 1 SLR 166 (“<em>Chuang Uming</em>”), it declined to do so (<em>Chuang Uming</em> at [73]–[74]). Recently, in <em>DyStar Global Hospitals (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Kiri Industries Ltd and others and another suit</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22502-SSP.xml')">[2018] 5 SLR 1</a>, the Singapore International Commercial Court cited the decisions of <em>Eshelby</em> and <em>Jarguh Sawit</em> as standing for “the principle that a cause of action must be established as at the date when proceedings are instituted, <em>ie</em>, the date of the writ” (at [136]); parties in that case accepted this as the operative principle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69">69&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the position remains that a party cannot be allowed to amend its pleadings to add a cause of action that did not exist when the writ was first issued. Before me, Mr Lam conceded that the authorities were with the Defendants in this regard. As such, the Purchaser’s attempt to amend his Statement of Claim to add his claim for the latent defects which did not exist at the time the writ was filed cannot be allowed.</a></p><a id="p1_69"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a><a id="p1_70">70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if I accept that I have the discretion (per <em>Galistan</em>) to allow such an amendment, I do not think that this is a case that merits such an amendment. As I have held, the present claims raised by the Purchaser are time-barred. The effect of the amendment to include the claim for latent defects is therefore to revive an otherwise empty claim. Furthermore, such an amendment would lead to the curious outcome whereby the cause of action for latent defects would revert back to the date of the writ, which pre-dates the accrual of that cause of action (see [65] above). The claim for latent defects is also not time-barred, and so there is nothing preventing the Purchaser from re-initiating the claim by filing a fresh writ with his wife as a co-plaintiff. This, in my view, would be a neater and more principled outcome than if I were to allow the present claim to stand on a fresh last leg.</a></p><a id="p1_70"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a><a id="p1_71">71&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I find that the Purchaser, as one of two joint tenants of the Property, lacks the <em>locus standi</em> to carry on the proceedings against the Defendants in his sole name. While he has sought to cure this defect by applying to add his wife as a party to the action, he cannot be allowed to do so because his existing claims against the Defendants, whether in contract or in tort, are time-barred. Furthermore, I do not allow his application to add a new cause of action for latent defects as this arose after the writ of summons was filed, and cannot be added per the rule in <em>Eshelby</em> ([65] <em>supra</em>), which remains the law in Singapore.</a></p><a id="p1_71"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a><a id="p1_72">72&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the foregoing reasons, I dismiss the Amendment Summons in its entirety.
