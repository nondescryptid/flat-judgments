If the Accused had indeed maintained a proper lookout, he would have seen the Victim. On the contrary, it appeared that the Accused did not notice the Victim until almost at the very last minute. This is evident from the video footage when he swerved slightly to his left to avoid hitting him.

In addition, the factors affecting the severity of sentence include, amongst other thing, (a) the degree of injury or property damage; (b) evidence of alcohol consumption; (c) failing to stop to evade arrest; and (d) prior antecedents.</a></p><a id="p1_73"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a><a id="p1_74">74&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this present case, I considered the following factors:</a></p><a id="p1_74"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74"></a><a id="p1_74-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The injuries suffered by the Victim.

While the Accused did not fail to stop to evade arrest in the sense that he was not being pursued by the police, his subsequent actions thereafter was very telling. In the Statement of Facts at [6], it was revealed that the Accused “…. <em>lodged a police report online on 10 July 2020, at about 11:52 am, stating that he had been driving along East Coast Road towards Upper East Coast Road and heard a sound at the right side of his car, when he arrived home, he noticed that the right side mirror was damaged.</em>” In my view, this clearly showed that the Accused was attempting to evade responsibility. A review of the video footage clearly showed that the Victim had crossed the entire frontage of his vehicle and that he had taken evasive at the very last moment. I was incredulous that the Accused claimed that he did not know that he had collided with someone.</a></p><a id="p1_74-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_75">75&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Lim Meng Soon</em> at [34], Lee Sieu Kin J highlighted that <em>“ …. hit-and-run offences must be severely dealt with as it constitutes a reprehensible abdication of the fundamental moral obligation to render assistance to a victim of an accident engineered by one’s</em><em>own negligence or recklessness…</em>”. Further, in the event where life threatening injuries are suffered by a victim, any assistance rendered, even from the offender, could well mean the difference between life and death for that victim.
