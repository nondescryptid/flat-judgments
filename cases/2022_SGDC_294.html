All parties were involved in a business venture. After hearing the trial, my decision was to dismiss the claim. Being dissatisfied, the plaintiff has since appealed against my decision. These are the full grounds of my decision.</a></p><a id="p1_1"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2015, the defendants who were researchers in Agency for Science, Technology and Research (“A*Star”) were looking for an investor with contacts who could help them commercialise their research in artificial intelligence which had various industrial applications. The plaintiff, who had extensive career and contacts in the oil and gas industry, decided to enter into a business venture with the defendants by providing the start-up capital. The plaintiff and the second defendant would first incorporate the company as directors and shareholders and the first defendant would later join them as a director and shareholder.</a></p><a id="p1_2"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this purpose, the plaintiff and the second defendant incorporated a company by the name of Krakatoa Pte Ltd (“Krakatoa”) on 28 July 2015. At the point of incorporation, the plaintiff and second defendant held equal shareholding in Krakatoa. As at September 2015, both defendants were involved in one Vamolabs Pte Ltd (“Vamolabs”), a company which was in the business of Information Technology. The second defendant was also a director and shareholder of Vamolabs. On 14 May 2016, the first defendant became a shareholder of Krakatoa. The shareholding on 14 May 2016 was that the plaintiff held 30% shares and the remaining shares were held by the defendants at 35% each.</a></p><a id="p1_3"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship between parties subsequently soured and resulted in the present suit.</a></p><a id="p1_4"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ cases </p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s version</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the plaintiff, the parties had a verbal agreement at a meeting held on 12 September 2015, that the first defendant would close Vamolabs and he would work exclusively for Krakatoa, the second defendant would also work exclusively for Krakatoa once he joined the company and the parties would execute a simple shareholders’ agreement once the first defendant joined Krakatoa.</a></p><a id="p1_5"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff claimed that he had paid a total of $210,000 as capital for Krakatoa and the defendants did not provide monetary contribution but had contributed their technical know-how. It was undisputed that to date, there was no shareholders’ agreement that had been executed. The plaintiff also pleaded that both defendants continued to be involved in Vamolabs. In the premises, the defendants had been unjustly enriched as there was a total failure of consideration. Hence, he sought return of the sum of $105,000 from each defendant with interest and costs.</a></p><a id="p1_6"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendants’ version</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendants denied that there was a verbal agreement made between parties at the meeting of 12 September 2015 about shareholders’ agreement and exclusivity of working only for Krakatoa. The arrangement between parties was that the plaintiff was to contribute $300,000 to Krakatoa and the defendants, who had contributed their technical know-how, would receive the shareholding of 35% each with the plaintiff holding the remaining 30% shareholding.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was pleaded by the defendants that at no point did they ever receive the benefit of their shares in Krakatoa at the expense of the plaintiff.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues to be determined </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crux of the dispute between parties centred on whether the defendants were each liable for the sum of $105,000 in that there was unjust enrichment for the defendants as there was a total failure of consideration. In this regard, the issues before the court were as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_9"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="">Issue 1- What was the basis of the transfer of the plaintiff’s investment sum?</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a><a id="">Issue 2- Was there a total failure of consideration?</a></p><a id=""> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision of the court</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was pleaded by the plaintiff at [9] of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) that the main cause of action was unjust enrichment as there had been a total failure of consideration.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law on unjust enrichment is trite which is borne out by <em>Benzline Auto Pte Ltd v Supercars Lorinser Pte Ltd</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21275-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGCA 2</a>. The 3 factors are:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enrichment of the defendant;</a></p><a id="p1_11-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_11-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the expense of the plaintiff; and</a></p><a id="p1_11-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_11-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circumstances which make the enrichment unjust.</a></p><a id="p1_11-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that the plaintiff had not proven his case of unjust enrichment. I found that there was no real contention on factors a and b in that based on the contemporaneous documents<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a>, it was clear that the defendants were paid a monthly salary of $5,000 to $6,000 in 2019 and since the defendants agreed that they did not contribute financially to the capital of Krakatoa, such payments were made from the working capital paid by the plaintiff.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff pleaded that the defendants did not pay for their shares of 10.5 million each in Krakatoa (constituting 35% shareholding each in the company) and these shares were paid in cash by the plaintiff. It was not disputed between parties that the plaintiff made monetary contributions and the defendants did not contribute financially and instead contributed their technical know-how.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that the dispute centred mostly on factor c which related to a total failure of consideration which made the enrichment unjust. Here, the pleaded unjust factor relied on was failure of consideration. Hence, the court went on to firstly, determine what was the basis for the plaintiff’s investment in the subject company Krakatoa of which restitution was now sought and secondly, did this basis fail? In [48] to {52] of the Benzline decision, the Court of Appeal clarified that the consideration/basis in the promissory sense is the performance of a counter-promise in that a party performs its part of the bargain, he does so in the expectation that the counter-promise will actually be performed. Not every expectation of the party making the transfer forms part of the basis of the transfer. The basis of a transfer must be objectively determined based on the communication between parties and the parties’ uncommunicated subjective thoughts are irrelevant. Finally, a transfer may have more than one basis.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 1- What was the basis of the transfer of the plaintiff’s investment sum?</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the instant case, the plaintiff claimed that the basis for the transfer of the plaintiff’s investment sum was as pleaded in [4] of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2). It was pleaded that on 12 September 2015, there was an oral agreement made between the plaintiff and the two defendants on following bases:</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_15-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first defendant would close Vamolabs and he would work exclusively for Krakatoa;</a></p><a id="p1_15-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_15-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the second defendant would also work exclusively for Krakatoa once he joined the company; and</a></p><a id="p1_15-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_15-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the parties would subsequently execute a simple shareholders’ agreement between them once the first defendant joined Krakatoa.</a></p><a id="p1_15-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was undisputed that the plaintiff and the second defendant became directors and shareholders of Krakatoa on 28 July 2015 with equal shareholding and the first defendant became a shareholder with effect from 14 May 2016. The shareholding with effect from May 2016 was for the plaintiff to hold 30% shareholding for 9 million shares and the two defendants to each hold 35% at 10.5 million shares each. It was also undisputed that the second defendant only took steps to close Vamolabs effective 4 May 2021<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a>. Both defendants resigned as directors of Krakatoa on 1 March 2021.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also undisputed that the plaintiff had injected a sum of $120,000 into Krakatoa as the defendants were unable to contribute financially and instead, the defendants were to contribute their technical know-how and artificial intelligence knowledge into the company. I found that the plaintiff had not proven that there was an oral agreement made between the parties on 12 September 2015 for the defendants to perform the bases as alleged by the plaintiff although according to the plaintiff, this agreement formed the bases of the plaintiff’s transfer.</a></p><a id="p1_17"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the crucial period of July to September 2015, I found that although there were verbal and email mentions of 3 bases of exclusivity, closure of Vamolabs and shareholders’ agreement, the plaintiff had not proven that there was agreement between the parties on these 3 bases.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, this was apparent from the chain of emails on 11 September 2015<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a> where the defendants did not indicate their consent to the plaintiff’s proposal on the shareholding agreement and the exclusivity of working for Krakatoa. Their replies indicated that they had received the plaintiff’s email indicating his concerns and second defendant even indicated that he had one or two points to raise at the 12 September 2015 meeting.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I accepted the defendants’ explanation that there was no agreement even in principle for all parties on the shareholders’ agreement as the plaintiff did not extensively discuss the agreement and the terms such that the defendants could then indicate their agreement to the terms of such agreement. Even the plaintiff conceded during cross examination that little discussion took place about the specifics of the agreement. This was also borne out by M/s Latham &amp; Watkins LLP’s email of 16 June 2016<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a> which did not contain specifics of the shareholders’ agreement and that the first draft was to be drawn up with customisation for specific requirements. This law firm had been engaged to draft the shareholders’ agreement but its services were discontinued before such an agreement was finalised and executed as parties were concerned with the cost of its legal services.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I found that the contemporaneous evidence produced in court proved that there was no agreement to execute a shareholding agreement. In the email sent by the plaintiff to the defendants on 5 December 2017<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a>, at [9] of this email, the plaintiff clearly stated for the Serie A investor funding for Krakatoa, the good news “is that we are almost naked, <b>no shareholding agreement</b>, <b>no employment contracts</b>, no job description, <b>no IP</b>, <b>no non-compete clause</b>, nothing- so we can actually prepare ourselves very nicely from scratch and build a very nicely packaged story.” (emphasis mine).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the audio recording of 25 January 2018<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a> which was a conversation between the parties, the plaintiff stated that he “would like us to finalize the shareholding agreement”. In my view, this suggested that there was no agreement between parties. The second defendant stated in the same conversation<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> that the agreement was important and he emphasized that: “Without us discussing the substance of agreement, we cannot say anything further.” The same stance was subsequently repeated by the defendants<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. Even the plaintiff had conceded that “a lot of documentation to be done two years ago, we have never addressed the topic.” <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>More evidence could be seen in the first defendant’s declaration that there was no shareholding agreement and not to debate on this agreement that had not been defined<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. The plaintiff did not refute him on this. Further, the plaintiff went on to explain that he needed a shareholding agreement for protection<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>. Clearly, there was no agreement and hence the plaintiff took the position that his interests were not protected. Even in a later audio recording of 6 March 2018 of a conversation between parties<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>, the second defendant informed the plaintiff that “a shareholding agreement after the fact is complicated.” The plaintiff’s reply was not to deny but he replied “ it should have been done a long time ago. We have been talking about it for three years.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, an examination of the evidence at best revealed that there was an agreement to negotiate as the second defendant had testified in court that the defendants were open to the idea of a shareholding agreement but not to working exclusively for Krakatoa. As rightly pointed out by the defendants’ counsel in his Opening Statement and at [69] to [72] of the defendants’ Closing Submissions, an agreement to negotiate is unenforceable “simply because it lacks the necessary certainty” as enunciated by the High Court in <em>Grossner Jens v Raffles Holdings Ltd</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25263-M.xml')">[2003] SGHC 290</a>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 2- Was there a total failure of consideration?</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the plaintiff had not established the bases of the transfer as pleaded, there was no necessity for me to make a finding on the issue of whether there had been a total failure of consideration. However, for completeness, I shall briefly do so on whether there had been a total failure of consideration.</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At [53] of the Benzline decision, the CA enunciated that the failure must be total, not partial. As rightly pointed out by the defendants in their Closing Submissions at [73], partial failure of consideration barred an unjust enrichment claim unless the contract was divisible. This was established in the High Court case of <em>Max Media FZ LLC v Nimbus Media Pte Ltd</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 2 SLR 0677.xml')">[2010] 2 SLR 677</a> at [24]. It was not the plaintiff’s pleaded case that the alleged oral agreement was divisible.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking the plaintiff’s case at its highest in that the 3 bases constituted the basis for the plaintiff’s transfer, I found that there had only been partial failure of consideration assuming that the plaintiff had succeeded in establishing the 3 bases.</a></p><a id="p1_26"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that there had been a failure of consideration for the closure of Vamolabs on the part of the second defendant only. The second defendant did not close Vamolabs till 4 May 2021 when the suit was filed in 2019 as ascertained from ACRA records exhibited. As the first defendant was not a director or shareholder of Vamolabs, he was not in the position to close Vamolabs.</a></p><a id="p1_27"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the shareholder’s agreement, to date there had not been shareholders’ agreement signed by the parties and this had not been disputed by the parties. As such, there had been a failure of consideration on the part of the defendants on this score.</a></p><a id="p1_28"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the exclusivity basis, I found that there had been no failure of consideration on the part of both defendants. I accepted the second defendant’s evidence in court that although he did provide operational support to a French hospital client of Vamolabs in relation to the artificial intelligence technology on digital histopathology sold to the hospital by Vamolabs prior to incorporation of Krakatoa, Vamolabs was not actively conducting business and was actually dormant. As for the first defendant, there was no clear evidence that he was indeed working for another company other than Krakatoa. This meant that although the defendants did not agree verbally or in writing to working exclusively for Krakatoa, the plaintiff had not proven that the defendants had actively worked for another company. Therefore, I found that the defendants were in effect working exclusively for Krakatoa.</a></p><a id="p1_29"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the above reasons, I dismissed the plaintiff’s claim. After hearing parties on their submissions relating to costs and disbursements, I fixed the costs and disbursements accordingly to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendants.</a></p><a id="p1_30"> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"></a><p class="Footnote"><a id="p1_30"><sup></sup></a><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a>1AB pg 292-294</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>3 AB pg 58</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>1AB pg 233-234</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>1AB pg 324</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_5_1" id="Ftn_5">[note: 5]</a></sup>1AB pg 468</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_6_1" id="Ftn_6">[note: 6]</a></sup>3 AB pg 223</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_7_1" id="Ftn_7">[note: 7]</a></sup>3 AB pg 230</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_8_1" id="Ftn_8">[note: 8]</a></sup>3 AB pg 235 and 237</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_9_1" id="Ftn_9">[note: 9]</a></sup>3 AB pg 230</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_10_1" id="Ftn_10">[note: 10]</a></sup>3 AB pg 237</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_11_1" id="Ftn_11">[note: 11]</a></sup>3 AB pg 240 and 250</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_12_1" id="Ftn_12">[note: 12]</a></sup>3 AB pg 320</p></div></content></html>
