The Deceased paid $6,030.71 of the purchase price.</a></p><a id="p1_5"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after purchasing the Flat and making the initial payment, the Deceased became unemployed.

However, the defendant never moved into the Flat to live with the Deceased. Her case was that the plaintiff did not like her and did not want the Deceased to marry her. The Deceased told the defendant not to quarrel with the plaintiff. The defendant spent each day in the flat with the Deceased but would leave in the evenings.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a> The plaintiff did not say anything to contradict these facts.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deceased passed away on 12 August 2019 and the defendant was made administratrix of the estate pursuant to letters of administration granted under FC/P 5212/2019 on or around 11 November 2019.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 24 November 2020, the defendant obtained legal ownership of the Flat as the sole beneficiary of the Deceased’s estate.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a> On 20 June 2021, the defendant evicted the plaintiff from the Flat.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Did the presumption of a purchase price resulting trust arise?</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff’s claim is for a purchase price resulting trust over the Flat.

The following principles are relevant to this case.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A presumption of resulting trust arises when a person makes a voluntary payment to another person or paid (wholly or in part) for the purchase of property which vested in the other person (<em>Su Emmanuel</em> at [77]).</a></p><a id="p1_13-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_13-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctrinal basis for this presumption is that the law does not readily infer an intention by the payor of the purchase price to benefit the recipient of the property (<em>Su Emmanuel</em> at [78]).</a></p><a id="p1_13-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_13-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lack of intention to benefit the recipient is <em>inferred</em>. As such, the presumption of resulting trust will not be called in aid when the evidence that is before the court adequately reveals the true intention of the transferor. (<em>Su Emmanuel</em> at [79]).</a></p><a id="p1_13-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_13-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus is on the parties’ intentions at the time the property was acquired as the resulting trust crystallises at the time the property is acquired (<em>Su Emmanuel</em> at [87]).</a></p><a id="p1_13-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Su Emmanuel</em>, the payor purchased 49% of a property from the recipient for a specific price. Subsequently, the property was refinanced and a fresh mortgage was entered into between the payor, the recipient, and another party. The Court of Appeal found that at the time this mortgage was entered into, parties intended to contribute mortgage payments in accordance with their respective share. However, the payor made all of the subsequent payments. The Court of Appeal found that the subsequent mortgage payments did not give rise to a presumption of resulting trust because the payor only purchased 49% of the Property from the recipient. As such, their actual intentions on the payor’s share of the property were proved and there was no room for a presumption of resulting trust to arise. As the co-owners had contributed to mortgage payments differently from their intended share, the court applied the concept of equitable accounting to reimburse the payor for the excess sums that she paid.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to the present case. In my view, on the plaintiff’s own pleaded case and evidence, the plaintiff and the deceased’s intentions relating to the purchase of the Flat and the plaintiff’s payment of the balance purchase price are clear. It was pursuant to an agreement between the plaintiff and the Deceased for the plaintiff and her mother to be allowed to reside in the Flat. As such, there is no room for the presumption of resulting trust. I explain.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Flat was first acquired, the Deceased purchased the property on his own. There was no intention on the plaintiff’s part to contribute to the purchase price.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a> It was only after the Deceased acquired the property and became unemployed that he agreed with the plaintiff for her to pay the remainder of the purchase price.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, the content of this verbal agreement as pleaded by the plaintiff is both crucial and fatal to her claim for a purchase price resulting trust. The parties’ intentions are spelt out in the pleaded agreement:<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a> In exchange for paying the remainder of the purchase price of the Flat, the plaintiff and their mother were allowed to reside in the Flat. This was an agreement premised on a mutual exchange of obligations. The plaintiff was obliged to pay the remainder of the purchase price and the Deceased was obliged to allow the plaintiff and their mother to reside in the Flat. In other words, this was nothing more than a license agreement.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying <em>Su Emmanuel</em> at [79] (see [13(c)] above), the presumption of a resulting trust cannot apply in this case to infer the plaintiff’s lack of intention to benefit the Deceased. The plaintiff has expressly pleaded and given evidence that she made payment of the balance purchase price pursuant to an agreement for her and her mother to be allowed to reside in the Flat. As such, there is no room left for the presumption of resulting trust to arise. The payment is simply consideration for her being allowed to reside in the Flat, and does not give the plaintiff an interest in the Flat.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the same reason, equitable accounting for excess mortgage payments is not available in this case. The plaintiff did not make any payments on behalf of the Deceased in excess of their common understanding of what their obligations were. She simply paid the balance purchase price for the Flat pursuant to the pleaded agreement.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an issue that should have caught the plaintiff by surprise. At the commencement of trial, I specifically raised the issue of whether the plaintiff’s pleaded agreement was consistent with her claim for a purchase price resulting trust. Plaintiff’s counsel indicated that he would address the issue in closing submissions, but he did not do so.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, I dismissed the plaintiff’s claim for a purchase price resulting trust.
