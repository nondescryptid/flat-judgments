In the context of voyeurism offences under s 377BB(4) PC, a three-judge coram of the High Court recently held that a deterrence sentence is usually warranted for such offences as they “often inflict significant emotional harm on the victim” (<em>Nicholas Tan Siew Chye v PP <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29336-SSP.xml')">[2023] SGHC 35</a> (“Nicholas Tan”</em>) <em>at [44]</em>). More pertinently, a different three-judge coram of the High Court held that general deterrence is likely to be the overriding sentencing consideration where an offender distributes intimate images or recordings of another person without that person’s consent (<em>PP v GED and other appeals <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29054-SSP.xml')">[2022] SGHC 301</a> (“GED”) at [106]</em>). This remains so in this case, notwithstanding the accused’s age at the material time.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the AP was 17 to 20 years old when he offended, rehabilitation is eclipsed by deterrence for four key reasons.</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_b-p3_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence had been adduced by the prosecution to show that the AP had thoroughly humiliated and traumatised, XXXX, the victim (V), causing her severe emotional and reputational harm by posting V’s nudes online in pornographic websites and sent them to a mutual friend where V’s private parts and face were visible and these nudes were viewed or shared thousands of times as of 2021. In fact, more than one of the videos posted by the AP on xHamster were re-shared on various other pornographic websites which only serves to compound the grave harm suffered by V. Even if the AP had indeed deleted V’s nudes from xHamster, that is not a sign of repentance as he went on to send a nude video of V to a mutual friend, YYY. Further, the AP deliberately assumed V’s persona in the caption for each Tumblr post which were all accompanied by degrading captions that portrayed V as a promiscuous woman who openly invited others to sexualise her and who had posted her own nudes online. More egregiously, some of the captions even played into pornographic tropes and rape fantasies, which would have compounded V’s trauma and humiliation.</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_b-p3_i"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_5-p2_b-p3_i"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_b-p3_ii">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deterrence must take centre stage as the AP had committed serious offences (<em>Boaz Koh at [30]</em>) of distributing another person’s nudes which brings deterrence to the fore. The maximum punishment under s 292(1)(<em>a</em>) PC is three months’ imprisonment and a fine, but this belies the gravity of the AP’s offending. To reflect the severity of such offences, Parliament has since enacted s 377BE PC, which provides for a maximum imprisonment term of <em>five years</em> and <em>caning</em>. The strong legislative response to offences involving the distribution of intimate images and recordings reflects Parliament’s intention to place deterrence at the fore for such offences (see, in this vein, <em>Nicholas Tan at [48]</em>).</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_b-p3_ii"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_5-p2_b-p3_ii"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_b-p3_iii">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deterrence is the predominant sentencing consideration as evidence had been adduced by the prosecution to show that the AP is recalcitrant (<em>Boaz Koh at [30]</em>). The AP’s first charge alone, for possessing 14 nude videos and photographs of V that he uploaded on Tumblr, spanned a period of about a year. He then posted V’s nudes on xHamster and sent them to a mutual friend, YYY on four separate occasions in 2019. Unrepentant, he illicitly took photographs and videos of other women in compromising positions on three distinct occasions in 2020, before he was finally arrested and found to be in possession of obscene films. With each passing year, not only did the AP not gain insight into his wrongdoing, but he also evinced time and again his total disregard of the privacy of the women who had been intimate with him.</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_b-p3_iii"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_5-p2_b-p3_iii"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_b-p3_iv">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP should be treated as an adult offender to whom the presumptive primacy of rehabilitation did not apply, notwithstanding that he was below the age of 21 when he offended (<em>A Karthik at [34] and [58]</em>). The AP was 17 years old when he first offended, but he continued offending until he was just two months shy of turning 21 years old and there is also no evidence of the AP’s rehabilitative progress since the time of his offending. There is nothing to suggest that he has taken any active steps post-offence to leave his errant ways behind (<em>PP v Siow Kai Yuan Terence </em></a><em><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25125-SSP.xml')">[2020] 4 SLR 1412</a> (“Terence Siow”) at [55(a)] and [56(b)]</em>). It does not appear that he has sought treatment or counselling to address the root causes of his offending. Moreover, some of the videos in MAC-910356-2021 were pornographic videos that the AP had downloaded online, with no evidence that he has stopped or limited his consumption of pornography.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP’s offending cannot be dismissed as mere youthful folly. There is no innocent excuse for posting a girlfriend’s or ex-girlfriend’s nudes on Tumblr with lewd captions, or on xHamster, a pornographic website. It would also have been obvious to anyone – and especially to a 20-year-old – that uploading V’s nudes on a pornographic website would cause her significant distress. What the AP’s offending reveals is not immaturity, inexperience or indiscretion, but a callous indifference to V’s ensuing humiliation.</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP’s persistent offending over three years also indicates that his rehabilitative prospects are not exceptional (<em>Praveen s/o Krishnan v PP </em></a><em><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21718-SSP.xml')">[2018] 3 SLR 1300</a> at [30(b)]</em>). The AP’s good performance in National Service and university did not evince his capacity for reform as he was able to compartmentalise his wrongdoing from other well-functioning aspects of his life, much like the respondent in <em>Terence Siow</em> (<em>Terence Siow at [33] and [77]</em>). He should not be allowed to come to court to say that he has a bright future in view of his good university performance and must serve the sentence for his offences first, as stated in the Law Minister’s Ministerial Statement on the Review of Sentencing Framework for Sexual and Hurt Offences on 5 March 2021.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_e">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have considered the defence submissions and rejected them for the following reasons as submitted by the prosecution:</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_e"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_5-p2_e"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_e-p3_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence submission that the AP “could not” delete V’s nudes from his Tumblr account as he “no longer has access” to the account glossed over the fact that the AP did have access to his own Tumblr account from May 2017 (when he first uploaded V’s nudes) all the way until at least 2021. At no point in time over that period of at least three and a half years did the AP delete V’s nudes from his Tumblr account or delete his Tumblr account entirely. It was by the AP’s choice that V’s nudes remained accessible on his Tumblr account for years, and he is thus responsible for the resulting harm to V.</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_e-p3_i"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_5-p2_e-p3_i"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_e-p3_ii">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence submission that specific deterrence is not a key sentencing principle because the AP offended when he was below the age of 21 and is now more mature do not militate against the primacy of specific deterrence in the present case as the AP had offended repeatedly over three years and up until his arrest at the age of 20 years and ten months and his persistent offending brings specific deterrence to the fore.</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_e-p3_ii"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_5-p2_e-p3_ii"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_e-p3_iii">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence submission that for the s 30(1) Films Act offence, the need for general deterrence is proportionate to the number of obscene films in an offender’s possession cannot be the case as general deterrence aims to deter other like-minded members of the general public. It is the type and/ or circumstances of a particular offence (eg, whether the offence was premeditated or committed against vulnerable victims; the prevalence of the particular offence; or whether the offence affected public safety) that is relevant to the need to deter other members of the public (<em>PP v Law Aik Meng </em></a><em><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 2 SLR(R) 0814.xml')">[2007] 2 SLR(R) 814</a> at [24]–[25]</em>), not the minutiae of the number of obscene films in an offender’s possession.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_5-p2_e-p3_iv">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence argument that the “like-minded members of the general public” who might need to be deterred are teenagers between the ages of 17 and 20, and that such teenagers should not be punished harshly” is mistaken as general deterrence targets like-minded members of the public which comprise would-be offenders of any age who are tempted to commit similar offences. The defence submission that teenagers between the ages of 17 and 20 should not be dealt with harshly is also a <em>non-sequitur</em> as this court is concerned only with how the AP in the present case should be dealt with since every sentencing matter should be based on its own facts and circumstances.</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_e-p3_iv"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_5-p2_e-p3_iv"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_e-p3_v">(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to the defence submission that as the AP was below the age of 21 when he offended, his rehabilitative potential and remorse should be considered for a probation report to be called for him to determine his suitability for probation, it is trite law that when sentencing an offender who was at or below the age of 21 at the time of offending but above the age of 21 at the time of sentencing, the court cannot and should not focus exclusively on the offender’s age at the time of offending. Instead, in deciding whether the offender should be treated as a youthful or adult offender, the court must examine all the facts, including the offender’s age at both material points in time, the length of the delay between both points, and any evidence of the offender’s rehabilitative progress in the intervening period (<em>A Karthik v PP </em></a><em><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22640-SSP.xml')">[2018] 5 SLR 1289</a> at [58]</em>).</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_5-p2_e-p3_vi">(vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP is who is now 23 and a half years old, is an adult offender who should be treated as such and the main sentencing principle engaged is deterrence, not rehabilitation, and the appropriate sentence is therefore imprisonment. If anything, it is highly worrying that the AP was capable of such cruelty even before he was 21 years old. Many youths are immature, but few invite the sexual objectification of their ex-girlfriends by posting their ex-girlfriends’ nudes on pornographic websites. Equally few upload their ex-girlfriends’/ girlfriends’ nudes on social media websites with degrading captions that play into pornographic tropes. Such disturbing misconduct cannot be met with a slap on the wrist in the form of a probation order.</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_e-p3_vi"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_5-p2_e-p3_vi"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_e-p3_vii">(vii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the defence assertion that the AP’s good performance in National Service and university evinced his capacity for reform, the evidence adduced by the prosecution showed that the AP has not made any rehabilitative progress. He offended while being a student leader at Ngee Ann Polytechnic and a national karate athlete, and while performing well at an aerospace engineering internship. In other words, he was able to compartmentalise his good performance in other areas of his life from his offending behaviour (see <em>PP v Siow Kai Yuan Terence </em></a><em><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25125-SSP.xml')">[2020] 4 SLR 1412</a> at [33] and [77]</em>).

He only pleaded guilty on the first day of trial. Furthermore, the evidence against him was strong and he had little choice but to plead guilty. He was caught red-handed for the s 30(1) FA offence, and the evidence for the s 292(1)(a) PC charges pointed to him as the culprit since he was the only person who possessed so many of V’s nudes. His plea of guilt is hence hardly mitigating (<em>PP v BDB </em></a><em><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21397-SSP.xml')">[2018] 1 SLR 127</a> at [74]</em>).</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_5-p2_h-p3_ii">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the AP has no antecedents, he should not be treated as a first time offender as he committed multiple offences over a long period of three years (<em>Chen Weixiong Jerriek v PP </em></a><em><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2003] 2 SLR(R) 0334.xml')">[2003] 2 SLR(R) 334</a> at [15] and [17]</em>).</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_5-p2_h-p3_i_1">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am mindful of the High Court exhortation that no two cases can or will ever be completely identical or symmetrical, the sentences cannot be determined with mathematical certainty but must not be arbitrary and must fit the crime. (<em>Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v PP </em></a><em><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2005] 3 SLR(R) 0001.xml')">[2005] 3 SLR(R) 1</a> at [24]</em>). I note that while both parties have relied on the case of <em>PP v Koh Kwok Lun, Samuel <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18891-SSP.xml')">[2016] SGDC 130</a></em> where the offender was sentenced to ten weeks’ imprisonment for a single charge under s 292(1)(a) PC with no TIC charge as sentencing precedent, each party had tried to distinguish it on the facts to show the differences. I agreed with the prosecution that the present case is more egregious as the offender in the aforesaid <em>Samuel Koh’s case</em> committed an one-off with no repeated offence and transmitted a single (and no multiple) obscene photo image which showed only the victim’s exposed breasts to a friend not known to the victim. <em>Samuel Koh’s case</em> is less egregious than our present case as in that case, there was no grave abuse of trust, no full private parts, no highly sexual and private acts (such as fellatio, masturbation, and penetrative sexual intercourse) shown in at least 4 videos with intensely demeaning captions posted on Tumblr and xHamster which attracted hundreds, if not thousands, of views, and which were widely re-shared on other Tumblr accounts and pornographic websites. Contrary to the defence submissions, both the offender in <em>Samuel Koh’s case</em> and the AP did not profit from his offences and that the offences did not constitute revenge pornography and V was in fact identified by her friend in several of these videos.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_j">(j)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the s 30(1) FA charge which concerned the AP’s possession of 44 obscene films, I agreed with the following prosecution submissions when I imposed a 2 weeks sentence for this charge:</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_j"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_j"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two factors which heighten the AP’s culpability:</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_i"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_5-p2_i"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_i-p3_1">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 44 obscene films comprised not only pornographic videos that the AP had downloaded online, but also voyeuristic videos of women engaging in sexual acts that he had personally recorded. The AP was not a wide-eyed, sexually curious teenager – he was a voyeur who satiated his sexual urges at the expense of multiple women’s dignity, and who could not care less about respecting the privacy of women at their most intimate and vulnerable moments.</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_i-p3_1"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_5-p2_i-p3_1"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_i-p3_2">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 44 obscene films were found across three devices (two iPhones and a hard disk), which suggests that the AP likely obtained them over an extended period and not all at once. This is aggravating as it speaks to his commitment to possessing obscene material.</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_i-p3_2"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_i-p3_2"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_k">(k)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the defence argument that “[a]part from the videos/images canvassed in the 1st – 3rd Charges, there is no evidence that [the AP] circulated the other videos/images”, the images and videos that formed the subject matter of the first to third charges (under s 292(1)(a) PC) did not overlap with the 44 videos that were the subject matter of the s 30(1) FA charge. In other words, besides posting 12 nude images and two nude videos of V on Tumblr (MAC-910350-2021), posting three nude videos of V on xHamster (MAC-910351-2021) and sending a nude video of V to a mutual friend (MAC-910352-2021), the AP was also in possession of another 44 obscene films (MAC-9103562021). It is not mitigating that the AP did not circulate the 44 obscene films in his possession. The gravamen of an offence under s 30(1) FA lies in the possession, not distribution, of obscene films. The offender in <em>PP v Chong Hou En </em></a><em><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17410-SSP.xml')">[2015] 3 SLR 222</a> (“Chong Hou En”</em>), who was convicted of an offence under s 30(1) FA (among other offences) and sentenced to 4 weeks imprisonment, likewise did not distribute the obscene films in his possession.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_l">(l)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for defence argument that the AP did not profit from the possession of the 44 obscene films, which were mainly for his personal consumption, the absence of an aggravating factor is not a mitigating factor and the offender in <em>Chong Hou En</em> similarly possessed obscene films for his own consumption and without profiting.</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_l"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">(D) CONCLUSION</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5-p2_l"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the aforesaid global sentence of 13 weeks’ imprisonment which I have imposed on the AP was not manifestly excessive or inadequate, but entirely appropriate and consistent with the principles of proportionality and totality without the effect of a crushing sentence on the AP.
