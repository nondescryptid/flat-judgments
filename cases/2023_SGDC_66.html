On 25 June 2022 at about 11:00pm, the accused had consumed four small glasses of ‘Carlsberg’ beer at a coffeeshop at Serangoon Road. The accused started drinking at about 11:00pm and stopped drinking at about close to midnight on 26 June 2022 when he received a call from an unknown person asking him to shift his vehicle. The accused left the location subsequently and went to his motorcar intending to park it at the nearest carpark.</a></p><a id="p1_6"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the accused was driving along Petain Road on 26 June 2022, at about 12.02am, he was stopped by the complainant, Senior Staff Sergeant Khairul Arifin Bin Mohd Yasin, at a police roadblock for checks. While engaging in a conversation with the accused, the complainant observed that the accused reeked of alcohol. The complainant administered a breathalyser test on the accused and the result shown was ‘Fail’. The accused was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol and escorted to Traffic Police for Breath Analysing Device (BAD) test.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BAD test was conducted by Senior Staff Sergeant Lim Hong Kiat on 26 June 2022 at about 1.01am at Traffic Police.

The prescribed limit is 35 <em>µg</em> of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the commission of the present offence, the accused had two previous convictions of the specific offences namely:</a></p><a id="p1_9"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_9-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on 19 March 2009, he had been convicted at Court 21 of Singapore for an offence of driving a vehicle when proportion of alcohol in body exceeds prescribed limit under s 67(1)(<em>b</em>) of the RTA vide DAC/16389/09 and</a></p><a id="p1_9-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_9-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on 4 April 2012, he had been convicted at the Subordinate Court of Singapore, for an offence of driving a vehicle when proportion of alcohol in body exceeds prescribed limit under s 67(1)(<em>b</em>) of the RTA vide DAC-1064-2012</a></p><a id="p1_9-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a><a id="">which convictions have not been set aside, and he shall be liable for enhanced punishment under s 67A(1)(<em>a</em>) of the RTA.</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the accused had committed the offence of Drink Driving under s 67(1) (<em>b</em>) punishable under s 67(1) read with s 67(2A) and s 67A(1)(<em>a</em>) of the RTA.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentencing</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Prescribed Penalty</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prescribed penalty for a second or subsequent offence of drink driving under s 67(1)(<em>b</em>) of the RTA is a fine of not less than $5,000 and not more than $20,000 and to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years.</a></p><a id="p1_11"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case as the accused was convicted for an offence under s 67(1) of the RTA for the third time, pursuant to s 67(2A) of the RTA unless the court for special reasons thinks fit to order a shorter period of disqualification, the court is to order that the person be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for life starting on the date of the person’s conviction.</a></p><a id="p1_12"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Antecedents</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 24 January 2005, he paid composition of $150 for an offence of speeding under s 63(4) of the RTA.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 19 March 2009, the accused was convicted in Court 21 for an offence of drink driving under s 67(1)(<em>b</em>) of the RTA.

He had two prior drink driving convictions and for his last conviction, he was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment, a fine of $4000 and disqualified for 4 years. As he is a third- timer, s 67(2A) of the RTA provides that the mandatory disqualification period is for life. In addition, as a repeat offender, the custodial sentence is also mandatory and being a third timer, there should be an uplift in the sentence from the second conviction.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was noted that his previous convictions were prior to the 2019 amendment to the RTA. It was submitted that the prescribed punishment has since been increased and enhanced to provide a stronger deterrence against irresponsible driving such as drink driving to allow for stiffer penalties to signal the aggravated seriousness of his action. It was the Prosecution’s position that in view of the high alcohol level and being a third timer, a sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment, a fine of $10,000 and disqualification for life with effect from the date of conviction was appropriate.</a></p><a id="p1_17"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigation</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence had submitted that the accused was extremely remorseful for his actions. The Court was urged to accept his timely plea of guilt as a sign of his contrition and regret for the wrong he had done. The accused admitted that he should not have committed the acts in question and his actions were a lapse of judgment. This was a scar that would remain with him for the rest of his life. It was submitted that the accused was truly remorseful for his actions. His remorse and contrition are evident from his readiness and willingness to plead guilty at the earliest opportunity. His timely plea of guilt had saved the court’s time and resources.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was further submitted that the accused had fully cooperated with the Traffic Police in their investigations, and been candid and forthright in giving his statements. The accused had been honest and did not evade his responsibility from the onset of these proceedings.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused is a divorce who lives with his 65-year-old aunt and 96-year-old grandmother since his divorcee. His grandmother suffers from regular urinary tract infection, leg ailments and a deteriorating brain capacity due to her old age. The accused’s mother is 70 years old and he provides for his mother and grandmother. The accused runs a business in the semi-conductor industry and because of his actions, he would face a custodial sentence which would affect his business. He intends to shut down his business after he served his custodial sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the Defence’s position that the accused understood the seriousness of his offence and was not making any excuses for what he did. He realised the gravity of his actions and was apologetic for it. He understood that his actions were extremely irresponsible and his behaviour posed a risk to members of the public and the property of others. He was highly repentant and had no intention of running afoul of the law again. The Court was urged to exercise leniency in sentence and to impose a sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prosecution’s Reply</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the Defence’s position on sentence, it was submitted that the proposed sentence of six weeks was more suitable for a second timer for such a level of alcohol. It was the Prosecution’s position that as a third timer, a sentence of eight weeks imprisonment was fairer and appropriate.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision on sentence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, the accused had been stopped at a police roadblock along Petain Road as he was driving his motorcar to the nearest carpark. This was after he had consumed four small glasses of beer at a Serangoon Road coffeeshop.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was mindful that as a second or subsequent offender for an offence of drink driving, the accused was liable to a mandatory imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years, a fine of not less than $5,000 and not more than $20,000 and mandatory disqualification for life from the date of conviction. He had already been previously sentenced as a repeat offender in April 2012 to two weeks’ imprisonment, fined $4,000 and disqualified for a period of 4 years from the date of release.</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As highlighted by the Prosecution, with the 2019 amendments to the RTA, the prescribed punishment for drink driving has since been increased and in fact doubled since his last conviction to provide a stronger deterrence against irresponsible driving such as drink driving. Presently as at the date of my decision, there is no existing sentencing framework enunciated by the High Court for repeat offenders for drink driving under s 67(2)(<em>b</em>) of the RTA.</a></p><a id="p1_25"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This increase in penalties for drivers, who are drunk or drug-impaired, arose out of a review of the RTA and it aimed to provide stiffer punishment to signal the aggravated seriousness of their actions. This is according to the explanation presented by the Second Minister for Home Affairs, Mrs Josephine Teo (the “Minister”) to Parliament on 8&nbsp;July 2019 (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (8&nbsp;July 2019), vol 94). The Minister’s explanation is set out below:</a></p><a id="p1_26"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…Drivers who are drunk or drug impaired show a blatant disregard for the safety of other road users. They are one of the biggest contributors to serious accidents on our roads. These are also accidents that clearly could have been avoided if the motorist had not come under the influence or did not drive. Currently, such motorists typically face the same maximum penalties as other motorists who cause accidents. The judge may take into consideration that the offender was driving under influence during the sentencing itself. But it would be clearer to have our intentions codified in law. In fact, our intention is for offenders driving under influence to face stiffer penalties to signal the aggravated seriousness of their actions…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Speaker, during the public engagement process, respondents felt that even standalone driving under influence offence where no accident is caused, should attract higher penalties to better attract its gravity.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">We agree with this view. The consumption of alcohol or drugs already makes a motorist a danger to other road users. Section 67 in Clause 17 of the Bill will raise the penalties to double the current levels. We will also raise the existing minimum DQ period to two years for first-time driving under influence offenders and five years for second-time driving under influence offenders. A lifelong disqualification will be imposed for third-time driving under influence offenders. In addition, we will amend section 47C through Clause 11 to allow Traffic Police to impose immediate suspension for all driving while under influence offenders.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the sentencing framework in <em>Rafael Voltaire Alzate</em> as a neutral starting point for first time drink drivers, the accused’s alcohol level at about 89<em>µg</em> would have placed him at the highest end of Band 3 <em>ie</em> between 70 to 89<em>µg</em> where the range of fines is between $6,000 and $8,000 and disqualification of between 36 and 48 months. Based on his level of alcohol alone, the accused’s culpability would have been within the moderate range as it fell within the second highest band of the sentencing framework.</a></p><a id="p1_27"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When sentencing, I would still have to calibrate the sentence upwards to factor in the mandatory imprisonment term as the accused is a repeat offender and consider whether there were any aggravating or mitigating circumstances. In determining the appropriate sentence, I would also consider other relevant factors such as the manner of driving, his reasons for driving, the type of vehicle, the distance travelled, the road and traffic conditions, any impairment of the ability to drive or whether there was accident resulting in harm to person or property and the duration between the last offence and his present charge.</a></p><a id="p1_28"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, the accused had driven to a coffeeshop where he had consumed beer and driven his car when he was asked to shift his vehicle. He was stopped at 12:02am at police roadblock when he was driving his motorcar to park at the nearest carpark. In my view, the accused clearly show a blatant disregard for the safety of other road users as well as the prohibition against driving while under the influence of drinks when he chose to move his motorcar to the nearest carpark. There was clearly no extenuating circumstances or emergency which necessitated his decision to drive that would have reduced his culpability. Despite being convicted on two previous occasions for drink driving, he had clearly not learnt his lesson on the consequences of committing such an offence.</a></p><a id="p1_29"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Sentence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, after considering the offence-specific factors such as his level of alcohol, which was at the second highest band of <em>Rafael Voltaire Alzate</em> framework, and that there was no injury or property damage, I was of the view that the accused’s culpability was lower end of moderate and the level of harm was low. Based on the above, the starting point for the present charge is twelve weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of at least $15,000. As the accused had pleaded guilty to the charge and he had reoffended ten years and two months after his last conviction, I had calibrated the sentence downwards to eight weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $10,000 to fulfil the objectives of punishment, the protection of the public and deterrence. The fine of $10,000 represents an uplift from the maximum Band 3 fine of $8000 for a first offender under the <em>Rafael Voltaire</em> framework. In my view, the sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment proposed by the Defence was manifestly inadequate in view of the accused’s moderate culpability as well as the aggravated seriousness of the accused’s actions.</a></p><a id="p1_30"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Disqualification Order</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case as the accused was convicted for an offence under s 67(1) of the RTA for the third time, pursuant to s 67(2A) of the RTA unless there are special reasons to order a shorter period of disqualification, the court is to order that the person be disqualified for life starting on the date of the person’s conviction.</a></p><a id="p1_31"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, no special reasons relating to the offence was provided by the Defence for the court to order a shorter period of disqualification. It was also clear that it was Parliament’s intention and within the public’s interest to remove such a driver from the roads by ordering a life-long disqualification order.</a></p><a id="p1_32"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things considered, I was of the view that the sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment, a fine of $10,000 in default one month’s imprisonment and a disqualification for life from the date of conviction was just and appropriate in the circumstances.</a></p><a id="p1_33"> </a></div></content></html>
