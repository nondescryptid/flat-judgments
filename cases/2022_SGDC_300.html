She was the landlord of Blk 221 Boon Lay Place #XXX, Singapore 640221 (“<b>the Unit</b>”), which is a Housing and Development Board (“<b>HDB</b>”) flat unit.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b><u>FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 1<sup>st</sup> CHARGE [DAC-910810-2021]</u></b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime in November 2018, the accused saw that a person was seeking assistance to rent a place in Singapore (“<b>the Lessee</b>”) on the website, Shichengbbs.com. As it was a way to earn money, the accused contacted the Lessee, who instructed him to get in touch with Yeo’s agent to view the Unit. The accused complied with the Lessee’s instructions.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 2 December 2018, the accused went to view the Unit with Tan Zheming, Yeo’s agent who was engaged to help her find a tenant for the Unit. The accused then took photographs of the Unit and sent it to the Lessee. The Lessee decided to rent the Unit and instructed the accused to sign the tenancy agreement for it. The Lessee also informed the accused that he would receive $800 after signing the said agreement.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 11 December 2018, the accused signed a tenancy agreement with Yeo to rent the Unit from 13 December 2018 to 12 December 2019 (“<b>the Agreement</b>”). In so doing, the accused deceived Yeo into believing that as the tenant leasing the Unit, he would abide by all the covenants in the Agreement, including to:</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use the unit for residential purposes only and not to use the unit in any manner that runs contrary to HDB rules and regulations or any other laws in force at any time.</p> </a><p class="Judg-Quote-1"><a id="p1_5">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused knew that this was false. HDB rules and regulation state than an “authorised occupier” for a HDB flat is a person who is:<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;named in an application made to the HDB as the person who intends to reside in the flat, house or other living accommodation sold or to be sold by the Board under Part IV of the HDB Act (Cap 129, 2004 Rev Ed) (“<b>HDB Act</b>”); or</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;authorised in writing by the Board to reside therein except that, where such a person has entered, stayed or remained in Singapore in contravention of any provision of any written law relating to immigration, he shall be deemed not to be an authorised occupier from the date of contravention.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused knew that the said rules would not be complied with. By such manner of deception, the accused dishonestly induced Yeo to make a valuable security by signing the Agreement.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the accused signed the Agreement and collected the Unit’s key, he passed the key to the Lessee’s friend. He was instructed to not lock the Unit’s door as the occupants would move into the Unit soon. Thereafter, the accused did not reside in the Unit nor return to it. He received $950 from the Lessee.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 17 January 2019, the police raided the Unit and arrested the following female subjects at the Unit:</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhu Siyu (“<b>Zhu</b>”), a 42-year-old female Chinese National;</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wu Lihua (“<b>Wu</b>”), a 41-year-old female Chinese National; and</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Fang (“<b>He</b>”), a 44-year-old female Chinese National.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhu, Wu and He were neither named in an application to HDB to reside in the Unit nor authorised by the HDB in writing to reside therein. Thereat, they provided sexual services. The accused claims that he did not have knowledge of the sexual services provided in the Unit.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, Wu and He were illegal overstayers in Singapore. Their special pass expired on 5 January 2019 and 27 December 2018 respectively but they chose to remain in Singapore to continue working and earn as much money as possible before returning to China.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence punishable under Section 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Antecedents</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused was untraced.</a></p><a id="p1_6"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prosecution’s Address on Sentence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution sought for an imprisonment term of one to two months citing the High Court decision in <em>Woo Haw Ming v PP</em><span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a> (“<b><em>Woo Haw Ming</em></b>”) at [31] and [36], that there is clear public interest in deterring fraudulent tenancy offences because of the difficulty in detecting such offences and how they facilitate illicit activities and introduce distance between law enforcement agencies and the perpetrators of the illicit schemes</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Woo Haw Ming</em>, the accused entered into tenancy agreements with the landlord of a unit without the intention of residing in the unit. When the police raided the unit, the officers arrested three female subjects who admitted to soliciting sexual services online and providing sex for profit at the unit. The High Court upheld the DJ’s decision to impose a sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment for each s 420 Penal Code charge. The High Court in <em>Woo Haw Ming</em> inferred that the accused knew that the premises would be used for illicit activities.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, vice activities were similarly detected at the unit. The three female occupants arrested at the unit were found to have provided sexual services there with two of them being illegal overstayers in Singapore.</a></p><a id="p1_9"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Prosecution submitted for the sentence to be calibrated slightly downwards after considering the fact that the accused faces only one charge and that he is a first-time offender. In contrast, the offender in <em>Woo Haw Ming</em> was traced and faced multiple charges. The High Court in <em>Woo Haw Ming</em> gave weight to the fact that the offender re-offended shortly after his release from prison in finding that the principle of deterrence was at the forefront of the sentencing calculus.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the above and considering accused’s plea of guilt and his remorse, the Prosecution submitted that a sentence of one to two months’ imprisonment should be imposed in the present case.</a></p><a id="p1_11"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Defence’s Submission on Sentence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence submitted for a one-day imprisonment and a high fine or alternatively a short term of one week imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_12"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence sought to distinguish the case in <em>Woo Haw Ming</em> for being more egregious as the offender in <em>Woo</em>’s case faced more charges and had inferred knowledge that the unit will be used for illegal activities unlike the present accused who is untraced and a first offender and who has no actual knowledge that the unit will be rented out for illegal activities.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused was remorseful and cooperated with the police and had his deposit of $2300.00 being forfeited by the landlord due to the breach of the rental agreement. He further incurred other losses as a consequence of this arrangement.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentencing Decision </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated by the High Court in <em>Woo Haw Ming</em>, there is a clear public interest to deter the proliferation of such fraudulent tenancy offences. Such offences are difficult to detect and usually the main culprit behind the syndicate invariably gets away as their identity cannot be traced with people such as the accused who voluntarily lent their name to be used by the syndicate for the greed of making an easy profit and turning a blind eye to the likely consequence of being used to facilitate illegal activities such as vice activities as well as facilitating the harbouring of overstayers in the present case.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the accused’s action of turning a blind eye on the real identities of the prospective tenants and in engaging in such a deliberate deception of “paper tenancy”, the accused had thereby facilitated the illegal vice activities being carried out to the detriment of the public.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the illegal activities lasted for a short duration due to the police prompt action cannot be attributed to the accused as a mitigating factor.</a></p><a id="p1_17"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, I accept that the accused’s culpability was less egregious compared to the offender in <em>Woo Haw Ming</em>. While I accept the accused’s claim that he had no direct knowledge that the unit will be used for illegal activities, he had however knowingly entered into a ‘paper tenancy” without exercising due diligence to ascertain that he would not be used by anyone to facilitate illegal activities at the unit. As a consequence of his action, he had facilitated the unit being used for vice activities and for harbouring two overstayers.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also of the view that hardship caused to the accused in terms of the losses incurred by the accused in engaging in the deception was not a mitigating factor as this was brought upon himself by his own doing.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking into consideration the circumstances of this case and the accused’s plea of guilt and his cooperation with the police and being a first offender, I am of the view that a sentence of three weeks imprisonment would be appropriate to serve as a deterrence to him and to other likeminded individuals from engaging in such a deception.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"></a><p class="Footnote"><a id="p1_20"><sup></sup></a><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a>Section 2(1) of the HDB Act.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27887-SSP.xml')">[2022] SGHC 204</a>.</p></div></content></html>
