TA arrived in Singapore on 17 February 2016, CV on 11 March 2016 and KR on 8 April 2016. Apart from the three victims, Muthu Vijayan Baskar (‘Baskar’) also worked there as a deejay and bartender and stayed at the club. He too is an Indian national. In addition, Danaraj s/o Pichanayagam (‘Raj’) worked as a cleaner and helped at the bar. He also resided at the Club.</a></p><a id="p1_5"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salient evidence of the witnesses called by the prosecution is summarised below.</a></p><a id="p1_6"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence of PW3 – Velloor Krishna Kumar (‘Velloor’)</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RR Group of Companies Pte Ltd (‘RR Group’) were the shareholders of the Club.

The agreement was signed in the presence of the accused. In March 2016, the revenue of the Club dropped drastically. Consequently, Krishna and the accused were unable to pay the monthly fee in one lump sum. The accused and Krishna requested for a two or three month extension of the agreement to August 2016.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Velloor testified that the accused was in charge of the day to day management of the club. He said the accused would approach him to make online applications for work permits for the dancers. The accused gave him the code to key in their occupation as ‘performing artiste’ and informed him to enter their monthly salary as $800. He confirmed that he made the online work permit application in P10 for TA, in P15 for CV and in P18 for KR, at the request of the accused.</a></p><a id="p1_9"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said the dancers had complained to him that their phones were being withheld.

In 2010, he came to know the accused. In February 2016, whilst he was in India, he called the accused to arrange for a job for him. The accused told him that he is running a club and offered him a job to serve liquor and to clean the tables and club premises for a monthly salary of $1,000. Baskar agreed to do the work and the accused made the arrangements for him to work at the Club.</a></p><a id="p1_12"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 5 March 2016, he arrived in Singapore. The accused told him what his duties were and taught him how to do the work. He only reported to the accused. He was aware the accused had a partner named Krishna. Baskar stayed in the Club. He said the accused, the dancers and one Raj also stayed in the Club. TA was already working as a dancer together with four others when he came to the Club. CV and KR started work subsequently. He stated the accused generally did the marketing. Sometimes, he (Baskar) was asked to buy vegetables. The accused would do the cooking for the employees.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the daily dance show ended at 3am, the accused would tally the amount received from the sale of liquor and the tips given by the customers to the dancers. This process would take about half an hour or so. He said the dancers and himself would be standing during this period near to the accused. He said the accused was abusive towards him when he suspected he had pocketed money although he (accused) had miscounted the money. He said the accused would talk to the dancers about their dancing, the amount of tips earned and their daily targets when he was checking the accounts. The accused would scold and abuse the dancers with vulgarities when the tips were low.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baskar said that everyone would eat after the show at around 3.30am. He would go to sleep between 4.00am to 5.00am and get up at 5pm. He said if the dancers were hungry, they would inform the accused and the accused would in turn wake him up to buy food. He said this happened about four times in a week.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asked how many entrances and exits there were to the Club, he said that there was only one entrance cum exit. He said the rear door was always secured with a padlock. He would only open it to bring the rubbish out. Asked if the street door and Club door would be open when the club is closed, he said both doors will be locked. However, the doors could be opened from within by twisting the door knob. He said he had seen the accused using the padlock to lock the Club door from the outside only when there was no one else in the Club and all of them were going out for a meal.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asked if the dancers could leave the club on their own, he answered that they could go out and there were no restrictions. However, it was also his evidence that he had not seen the dancers going out on their own.</a></p><a id="p1_17"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stated that the mobile phones of the dancers which they brought from India were kept in a locked drawer at the bar counter. He said they were given another mobile phone with a local SIM card.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He confirmed that there were CCTV cameras in the Club which were recording 24/7. He said the accused used the CCTVs to monitor the activities in the Club and the staff, which included the dancers, himself and Raj.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The learned DPP was given leave to cross-examine Baskar on his prior statement (P23) which he made on 16 June 2016 between 9 to 11pm at the premises of the Ministry of Manpower (‘MOM’). The statement was recorded by MOM officer Teng Yi Liang Derrick (‘Derrick’) with the assistance of a Tamil interpreter, K Kalidas (‘Kalidas’). He was referred to [7] in which it was recorded that the accused had instructed him on numerous occasions that the dancers are not allowed to go out of the accommodation; that the accused did not want to risk the dancers to get pregnant by allowing them to go out with the customers; and that he (Baskar) was given the responsibility to ensure that the doors were always locked when the accused and himself were not in the Club. Baskar claimed he was misunderstood and denied that he said the dancers were not allowed to go out. He said the doors could be opened from the inside by twisting the knob. He stated that he said the accused told him that he should lock up when he (Baskar) went out. He said he did not know whether the accused allowed the dancers to go out. However, he agreed that he told the recorder that the accused told him that he does not want to risk the dancers to get pregnant by allowing them to go out with customers of the club. He said he only came to know of this reason when the accused told the police in June 2016 when the police came to the club.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the last sentence in [7] that the dancers were not able to leave the premises, he claimed the recorder and interpreter repeatedly insisted in a loud voice that if the accused asked him to lock the doors it meant that the girls could not go out. He accepted the statement was interpreted to him before he signed. However, he said the interpreter raised his voice and spoke forcefully to emphasise the point that the girls were unable to go out of the premises. He said he was frightened and signed the statement as there was no way out.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went on to say that he was threatened that if he spoke in a manner that is not supportive, he would face a problem because it was illegal to start work before he obtained the work permit. The officer added that he will see to it that he does not face any problem if he cooperated. He confirmed that his work permit was issued on 23 March 2016.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He agreed that he gave the underlined contents at page 3 relating to photograph 9 which shows the interior of the Club door. He was asked who would be able to open the door, and he claimed that he meant by the answer that nobody could open the door from the outside, except for himself and the accused. He said the reason for locking the door so that no one could open it from the outside was misunderstood.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He agreed that the underlined contents at page 5 that he saw the accused slapping ‘Devi’ once and in relation to CV that he saw the accused raising his hand to slap her but did not know if he actually did so were accurate.</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under cross-examination, he said that all the dancers were “kind of angry” at TA because she received a lot of tips and the accused was ‘especially nice’ to her. He said that CV did not earn much tips as she could not dance. He initially stated that CV had asked the accused on two occasions if she could go out with a customer who was offering $1,000. Subsequently, he said she asked ‘many times’ to go out because customers were willing to pay $1,000. However, the accused rejected her requests. As a result, CV cried and made a lot of noise. He said the accused prohibited the dancers from going out with customers and said he was not running a brothel. He stated that a customer, George, had hit the accused with a bottle when he did not permit TA to go out with him, and on another occasion, another customer, Naidu, had slapped the accused for not allowing the dancers to go out with customers. He said there were two other occasions when customers caused physical damage when TA was not allowed to go out with them.</a></p><a id="p1_25"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said the accused had daily meetings with the dancers and he told them to earn tips from customers but not to get deeply involved with them like talking about marriage because they will be cheated. He said the accused had heard the same customers making marriage proposals to different dancers.</a></p><a id="p1_26"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his statement P23, he said another Chinese officer was present throughout the recording and he did the bulk of the questioning and raised his voice and scolded him. He said that Derrick spoke softly.</a></p><a id="p1_27"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence of PW1 – TA</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TA was 38 years old when she came to Singapore from India on 16 February 2016. She was a dancer in India. She was in debt in India and came here to work as a dancer at the Club. She was introduced to the job by one Vetri and the accused’s younger brother, Chandru, whilst she was in India. She was not told how much she would earn but was informed that she would get ‘collections’.</a></p><a id="p1_28"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was told she would be given an advance of 70,000 Rupees (around S$1,400) in India, and out of this amount, she received 60,000 Rupees and the remainder was given to an agent in India. She was told she had to collect S$12,500 for the amount she had received, failing which she will not be able to return to India. After she settled the amount, she will have to continue to work until her visa expired. If she earned further sums of S$12,500, she will be given another 70,000 Rupees for each target achieved. However, the monies will be accumulated and given to her when she returned to India. In addition, if her daily earnings were more than $500 per night, she would be entitled to a daily bonus of $50 but it would also be kept and handed to her when she returned to India.</a></p><a id="p1_29"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon arrival, the accused fetched her from the airport. She was taken to her place of work at the Club. She was asked by the accused to surrender her personal handphone. She said the accused kept the handphones of the dancers as he did not want them to contact the customers privately. However, she did not hand over her personal phone. About one week later, the accused demanded for her handphone. She refused and created a scene. About five to six days later, she surrendered her handphone as she realised that there was ‘no way out’. The accused then kept it.</a></p><a id="p1_30"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was in turn given the company’s handphone and told to use it to contact the customers to invite them to come to the Club. She was told not to make any phone calls to India with the phone. However, she did make calls to India with the phone. She had to surrender the company’s handphone at 8pm before the show started. She had to earn collections of at least $100 for the night in order to obtain the company’s handphone and retain it until 8pm the next day.</a></p><a id="p1_31"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 27 February 2016, she went for a medical check-up. On 8 March 2016, the accused brought her to apply for a work permit at MOM.</a></p><a id="p1_32"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 30 May 2016, there was a police raid. TA and the other dancers were brought to the police station. TA chose to return to the Club the following day but the other dancers did not. He explanation for returning to the Club was that the accused had told her that she would not be paid if it became a police case. She said that she wanted to continue working and to leave with the money she had earned. She continued working until there was a raid by MOM on 15 June 2016. She said the accused kept on saying that he will give her the money when she goes back to India but he did not.</a></p><a id="p1_33"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the MOM raid, she met the accused once at a bus-stop. Under cross-examination she said that the accused told her that the girls had got him into trouble and said a lot of bad things about him whereas he had actually taken good care of them. He asked her to follow her conscience.</a></p><a id="p1_34"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Curtailment of freedom</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said she was not allowed to keep even $1 dollar from her daily collections. She could not purchase her own necessities. She and the other dancers had to ask the accused to purchase things and he would buy as he deemed fit. She gave the following evidence in this regard<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a>:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">We should only listen to what he instructs. We cannot say anything, we cannot talk back, we cannot ask for anything that we desire on our own. Any little thing that we wanted to buy, even the toothpaste or brush, it has to be done only with his permission. Even our sanitary pad, we had to ask him and he would buy it for us and he would not---he would buy those of sub quality.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stated the accused had brought her and the dancers out but he would always decide where to go and he would always be with them. According to her, he brought them for an outing on two occasions – first, to the Marina Bay area on the day when there was a power outage at the Club, and second, to the zoo with his relatives. She said they were not allowed to bring their handphones and were not allowed to speak to anyone outside.</a></p><a id="p1_36"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stated the dancers were not allowed to go out on their own. The doors to the premises were kept locked. She said the keys were kept by the accused and Baskar. She added that she also did not have her passport, work permit and any money. Under cross-examination, she agreed the lock on the inside of the Club door had a twist lock which should open the door by twisting the lock. For the rear exit door, she said it was padlocked from the inside. As for the door leading to the laundry area, she said it had a chain with a padlock. The accused will leave it open but lock it when he was angry. As for the street door of the Club, she said that she had never tried opening it. She only noticed that it was sometimes locked and sometimes left unlocked when she went out with the accused or Baskar.</a></p><a id="p1_37"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Club door, it was her evidence that the accused would lock it from the outside when he went out. She said that she had tried to open it once from the inside when the accused and Baskar were not in the club but was unable to. She said that Baskar would open the Club door at 7.30pm for the customers. She placed flowers at the staircase during the daily evening prayers between 8 to 9pm.</a></p><a id="p1_38"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under further cross-examination, she said that she tried to open the Club door once during the daytime by turning the handle but was unable to as there was “something small attached there”.

Her personal phone was then taken away and she was given the company’s phone.

She was referred to the transcript P9T, which is an audio-recording from the accused’s phone, where the accused said on 12 May 2016, “<em>She requested for phone yesterday.

Some customers also placed their hands on her chest. She was upset when that happened. She told the accused that she did not like customers hugging and acting vulgar.

A business operations agreement dated 23 April 2015 was signed by Krishna with the RR Group (see P17) to operate the club from 1 May 2015 to 30 April 2016 with a monthly operator fee of $11,000 for the first three months and $13,000 thereafter.

Thereafter, they would place their phones in their respective tip boxes and use the Samsung handphones of the club. He claimed the India handphones would not work here. He said that all the customers’ contacts were stored in the company phones.

He said they could open the Club door and the street door by twisting the lock and pushing the door handle. He informed them where the exit routes were in the event of a fire and where the key was kept. He claimed that most of the time when he was going out, he did not lock the Club door by inserting the key into the keyhole from the outside because the area was dark. He would ask TA or the other dancers to lock the door from within when he left the Club between 12pm to 3pm to attend to his computer business. He used the padlock only when everyone in the club was not in, example, when they went out to eat on the days that he did not cook.</a></p><a id="p1_129"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a><a id="p1_130">130&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He claimed the dancers could have gone out on their own but they never asked to do so. He said they would sleep at 6 or 7am and they would be exhausted and thus asleep during the day. He said only CV had asked to go out with the customers because they were offering her money. He did not permit her to go out because prostitution was a breach of the licensing rules of the Club. He said that CV was unable to dance and he would advise her to improve her dancing skills to increase the tips. However, she would argue and say that she had to repay her advance payment. He still did not permit her to go out with customers. She then told him that she wanted to return to India. He spoke to her agent and told him to refund the advance payment or to arrange for a replacement dancer.</a></p><a id="p1_130"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a><a id="p1_131">131&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He produced photographs which showed that he had brought the dancers out.

He said that CV went out with his parents-in-law and him for sightseeing on one day. As for KR, he showed a photograph that she was at a mall on the day she went for a medical examination. In addition, he celebrated TA and KR’s birthday in the Club.

He claimed the dancers would not work for a monthly salary but on a ‘target’ basis. He said they received an advance payment before they came here. He said the payment vouchers in P11 reflected the amount that they had received. If the dancer received an advance payment of 100,000 Rupees, she would have to earn SGD17,000 in order to be entitled to receive 40% of the tips after the work permit is cancelled and before she returned to India. The remaining 60 per cent would be kept by the Club.</a></p><a id="p1_132"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a><a id="p1_133">133&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He denied that he harboured the three dancers by coercion by way of threats and curtailment of their freedom of movement.

For TA, he claimed she was given an advance payment of 90,000 or 100,000 rupees. He said that she wanted to work for three months. He bought her a pair of gold earrings with the tips. He said that she danced well and helped to improve the business.</a></p><a id="p1_133"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a><a id="p1_134">134&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards KR, he said that she received an advance payment of 70,000 Rupees and after her earnings from the collections, she was only required to pay 30,000 Rupees for premature termination.

As a result, he had a heated argument with him on the phone. During the argument, he told him the dancers wanted to go out and ‘do this kind of thing’. KR’s husband told him that KR is a virtuous lady. He then informed him that he has video clips that a customer has sent to KR in which she was speaking in a sexy manner with the customer. KR’s husband asked him to send the messages and he accordingly sent them to him. Asked when the conversation between him and KR’s husband took place, he said that it took place after the MOM raid whilst KR was staying at the hostel arranged by MOM.

At 10.29pm, he was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (‘TTSH’) by Elwin, Derrick and Jia Yi. They brought along the accused’s medication. The purpose of the medical examination was to ascertain if the accused was fit to be detained in custody and whether the medication was suitable. The doctor assessed the accused’s condition as ‘good’ and there to be unlikely any immediate danger to life. The doctor noted the accused has diabetes and high cholesterol and that he could continue with his regular medication (see P28 for the medical examination form).</a></p><a id="p1_141"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a><a id="p1_142">142&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 16 June 2016 at 2.44am, the accused was escorted back to THA after the medical consultation. The accused was given water and brought to Interview Room 9 (‘IR9’) for interview. Elwin spoke to the accused for around 15 minutes. He said that he did not question the accused as investigations were still ongoing and found it to be too early to start questioning the accused. Under cross-examination, he disagreed that he questioned the accused about what happened at the Club. He disagreed that Derrick, Jia Yi, Fu and Seva were also in the room. He disagreed that the accused said he had not done anything wrong. He disagreed that he told the accused to answer properly and banged on the table. He disagreed that the other officers also asked questions in a loud voice.</a></p><a id="p1_142"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a><a id="p1_143">143&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 15 minutes later, at 3.02am, the accused was referred to THA’s registration counter where his medication was kept.

He asked him why he had declined to take his medication so far. The accused told him that he does not need to take it. He told the accused that investigations were still ongoing. At 2.27pm, the accused was returned to the cell. Under cross-examination, he disagreed that Derrick, Seva and Jia Yi were also present. He disagreed that he asked questions and had a piece of paper on which he took down notes.

Elwin interviewed the accused in English. He asked him about the operations of club and the employment practice relating to the dancers. He said a Tamil interpreter was unavailable then and that is why he interviewed the accused in English. He stated that Malliga was involved in interpreting the statements of witnesses between 9pm to 11.45pm.</a></p><a id="p1_145"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a><a id="p1_146">146&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took down notes of what the accused told him.

He agreed that he asked the accused if the dancers were locked in the Club, if he paid them a salary, if they had a collections target. At 11.26pm, the accused was placed in the cell.</a></p><a id="p1_146"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a><a id="p1_147">147&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 17 June 2016 at 1.48am, the accused was taken to IR9 for statement taking. Elwin was present with the interpreter, Malliga. Elwin explained that he decided to record the statement in the early hours due to the urgency of the 48 hours detention which is permitted and also because he assessed the accused was used to being awake at night as he worked in the entertainment industry. Elwin testified that the start timing of ‘0100’ hours typed in the statement was incorrect and it should have been 1.48am. He typed the particulars of the accused, the contents of paragraph 1, the questions of paragraph 14, the last paragraph that the statement was read and keywords of the areas that he wanted to question the accused on before he commenced the recording at 1.48am. He typed the keywords so that he would not forget to ask the accused on those topics. As for the rest of the contents, he asked questions based on the interview notes and ad hoc questions or the contents were volunteered by the accused. He said the accused replied in Tamil through the interpreter but sometimes gave his answers in English.</a></p><a id="p1_147"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a><a id="p1_148">148&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recording of the statement ended at 2.30am.

The amendments were interpreted to the accused. Upon conclusion, the accused signed the statement. Malliga and Elwin also signed. As the accused is a holder of a foreign passport, he was informed that he could request for his Embassy to be notified of his arrest under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and was asked to acknowledge that he has been informed of his right, which he did (see P26). At 2.45am, the accused was returned to the cell.</a></p><a id="p1_148"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a><a id="p1_149">149&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cross-examination, Elwin disagreed that at 10.30pm he told the accused that he was taking a statement. He disagreed that is why he typed in statement J “I am resuming my interview and statement with MOM”. Elwin said that sentence was just meant to convey that “I’m doing my statement and doing my interview here at MOM”. He disagreed that he did not ask the accused if he was in ‘good health and mental condition’ to give the statement. He disagreed that he presented the accused with statement J which had already been typed before 1.48am. He disagreed that he could not have recorded the statement in 40 minutes. He disagreed that Derrick was also present and Seva came in and went out on a number of occasions. He disagreed that he told the accused that if he signed the statement, he would let him go back. He also disagreed that the accused was in a very compromised physical and mental state as a result of lack of sleep, lack of medication and lack of food. Elwin said the accused was cooperative. He said the accused only became hostile after the charges were served on him before he was charged in court.</a></p><a id="p1_149"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a><a id="p1_150">150&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 12.43pm on the same day, the accused was escorted by a THA Officer Arjun to IR9.

She said their purpose of being at THA was to update Elwin on what the witnesses had stated in their statements. She explained that she is able to recall this fact as she had jogged her memory by going through the statements that she recorded. She said as she was the main recorder of the statements of witnesses, it was incumbent on her to exercise due diligence and conduct the briefing before Elwin recorded the accused’s statement.</a></p><a id="p1_190"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Determination – statement J</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a><a id="p1_191">191&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that statement J was made voluntarily. In&nbsp;<em>Sulaiman bin Jumari v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25854-SSP.xml')">[2021] 1 SLR 557</a>, the Court of Appeal stated the test of voluntariness in the following terms at [39]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The first stage of the inquiry is whether there was any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against the accused person. If any of these was present, the next stage examines whether the said inducement, threat or promise was such that it would be reasonable for the accused person to think that he would gain some advantage or avoid any “evil” (meaning adverse consequences) in relation to the proceedings against him. These constitute the twin limbs of the voluntariness test (<em>Chai Chien Wei Kelvin&nbsp;v Public Prosecutor</em>&nbsp;<a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1998] 3 SLR(R) 0619.xml')">[1998] 3&nbsp;SLR(R) 619</a>&nbsp;at [53]). The first stage considers objectively whether any inducement, threat or promise was made. This entails a consideration of what might be gained or lost as well as the degree of assurance (see, for example,&nbsp;<em>Poh Kay Keong</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Ismail&nbsp;bin&nbsp;Abdul Rahman v Public Prosecutor</em>&nbsp;<a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2004] 2 SLR(R) 0074.xml')">[2004] 2&nbsp;SLR(R) 74</a>). The second stage, which is the subjective limb, considers the effect of the inducement, threat or promise on the mind of the accused person.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="">Explanation 1 to s 258(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 states that “if a person in authority who had acted in such a manner that his acts tend to sap and have in fact sapped the free will of the maker of the statement… such acts will amount to a threat, inducement or promise.” The litmus test for oppression is whether the investigation was, by its nature, duration or other attendant circumstances, such as to affect the accused’s mind and will such that he speaks when he otherwise would have remained silent” (<em>Tey Tsun Hang v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 1189.xml')">[2014] 2 SLR 1189</a> at [113]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192">192&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking first the threat to kill which the accused alleged was made to him in the van on the way back to MOM. The accused had two versions on who made the alleged threat. During the questioning of Gerald and Seva, the version which was put to them was that the threat was made by Derrick. On the other hand, during Elwin’s testimony and when the accused gave evidence, he claimed the threat was made by Elwin. When he was cross-examined on the different positions he had taken, the accused came up with a third version. He then claimed that Derrick told him whilst he was at the Club that he will kill him. This was again in conflict with his instructions which were put to Gerald and Seva, namely, that Derrick had threatened to kill him in the van. I found that the inconsistencies arose because the accused had deliberately conjured up the alleged threat.</a></p><a id="p1_192"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a><a id="p1_193">193&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the inconsistent and evolving nature of the accused’s evidence on the threat itself, his evidence was further undermined by his contradictory evidence on his reaction to the alleged threat. To begin with, there was no context to the alleged threat. He said he did not know why Elwin made the threat. He initially claimed he believed the threat and became scared, emotional and breathless, which caused Seva to touch his chest to calm him. In the same breath, it was his evidence that he said in Tamil, which was interpreted by Seva, that Elwin should not speak in such a tone and asked him to show respect. When the learned DPP pointed he therefore could not have been afraid, he retorted, “<em>Why should I be scared? I did not commit any mistake. I was not afraid.</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a> In the upshot, I found the accused’s evidence on the threat was not credible and disbelieved him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194">194&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During his detention at THA, the accused accepted that he was provided three meals a day, water, coffee and offered biscuits. He was provided an additional blanket when he asked for it. He was also repeatedly asked to take his diabetes medication but he declined to do so. The accused claimed that he only ate dinner on 15 June 2016 at 7.06pm and he chose not to eat the rest of the meals. If the accused’s evidence were to be believed, he would not have eaten anything on 16 June and he also did not eat his breakfast and lunch on 17 June 2016. Based on the records kept by the THA officers ( P27), the accused only rejected biscuits (s/no 31) at 11.26pm on 16 June 2016 and lunch (s/no 6) on 17 June 2016 at 1.39pm just before his detention at THA ended and was brought to court. It is not in dispute that the accused did not reject the rest of the meals. However, he claimed he did not eat. I did not accept the accused’s evidence. First, if the accused was determined not to eat, then he would logically have rejected the meals similar to what he did when he rejected the biscuits and the lunch on 17 June 2016. He did not give any explanation as to why he did not reject the meals. Second, the evidence of THA officer, Benson, was that the THA officers are required to record if an accused does not eat his food as it is considered an unusual occurrence. He agreed that he would not open the styrofoam box to check if an accused person has eaten but said that he would be able to gauge based on its weight. There is no record in P27 that the accused did not eat the meals which he accepted. Third, the accused did not provide any acceptable reason as to why he allegedly did not eat and instead chose to remain hungry for the extended period of time. He only said there was a lot of interviewing and it was difficult. This claim was untrue as the record in P27 shows that he was only taken for an interview once and for statement taking on another occasion. In contrast, for the last day when it was recorded that he rejected the lunch, he provided a reason that he was angry because he was served with the charges.</a></p><a id="p1_194"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a><a id="p1_195">195&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective evidence of the THA records show that the accused was taken out of his cell at 10.29pm and returned at 11.26pm on 16 June 2016. The THA record states that it was for an interview. The accused did not dispute that Elwin interviewed him during this period and took down the notes in P25. However, he claimed that Seva and another officer were present during the interview. I rejected the accused’s account. I accepted Seva’s evidence that he was not present. I accepted Elwin’s evidence that he was alone with the accused and communicated with him in English. Elwin’s account that he interviewed the accused alone was supported by the THA’s occurrence listing together with the THA movement book which do not record any other MOM officer being present during the said period.</a></p><a id="p1_195"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_195"></a><a id="p1_196">196&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the recording of statement J, the accused’s version was in stark contrast to the prosecution’s case. His account was that he was not questioned by Elwin in the presence of Malliga. He claimed he was questioned by Elwin in the presence of Seva and other Chinese officers, including a female Chinese officer. He was handed a typed statement by Elwin to sign, which he refused to sign as its contents were not in accordance to what he had said. He claimed that Malliga interpreted statement J on the following day and he was induced to sign the statement.</a></p><a id="p1_196"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196"></a><a id="p1_197">197&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rejected the accused’s version. Statement J states the start time of recording as 1.00am. Elwin explained that this was a mistake and it should have been 1.50am. The THA Movement logbook is proof of the fact that Malliga had signed in at 11.50pm. She was unable to remember what she did until 1.50am inside the THA. What is significant is that the accused was in his cell from 11.26pm until he was taken out at 1.48am. The THA officer recorded that the accused was taken to IR9 for statement taking with Elwin and an Indian interpreter is present. The version of the accused is convincingly refuted by the contemporaneous record made by an independent officer of THA which shows that he was with Elwin and Malliga from around 1.50am to until 2.45am when he was brought back to the cell. Further, the THA movement logbook shows that Malliga signed out at 2.52am which shows that she was in THA throughout when the accused was in IR9. Accordingly, I found that only Elwin and Malliga were present in the room during the recording of statement J.</a></p><a id="p1_197"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a><a id="p1_198">198&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards why statement J was recorded only at 1.50am on 17 January 2016, Elwin explained that the delay was due to the ongoing investigations. In this regard, the undisputed evidence is that further statements were being recorded from key witnesses between 5.15pm to 11.45pm on 16 June 2016. The THA Movement logbook (P29) shows that Jia Yi and Derrick signed in at about close to 1am on 17 June 2016 and signed out about half an hour later. I accepted Jia Yi’s evidence that their purpose was to give an update to Elwin on their investigation findings. I therefore found that there was no deliberate delay in recording the statement.</a></p><a id="p1_198"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a><a id="p1_199">199&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the accused’s evidence despite being allegedly tired due to lack of food, sleep and not having taken his medication, his ability to understand and speak was not impaired. He was asked by the DPP: “<em>So based on what you told us, in fact, that you didn’t take your medication or---or that you said you refused to eat the food didn’t affect your ability to understand the questions posed to you and answer them accordingly?”</em> He replied, “<em>No, I understood the questions and I answered</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a>. The evidence of Malliga was the accused was shouting and cursing at the girls during the statement recording. She said he answered some questions quite fast in English. He was listening to the statement when it was interpreted and also gave instructions to make amendments to it. Further, as Elwin testified, the accused was accustomed to being awake at night. Accordingly, I found that the will of the accused was not sapped by the detention.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200">200&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the alleged inducement that Elwin said he “will close the case after that and will release you”, the accused in cross-examination said he was only told that he would be released after he signed the statement.

What I meant was he will release me. I used my words incorrectly.”</em> In line with this, it was never put by learned counsel to Elwin and Malliga that Elwin had used the specific words “close the case”. Malliga’s evidence, which I accepted, was that the accused was crying and saying “Let me go. I want to go back.” She said that Elwin’s response was that “<em>Yes, you can go back. Let me finish the statement. After the investigation, you can go---you can go back</em>.” It is also clear from the evidence of Malliga that Elwin was only responding to what the accused was saying and it was not said because the accused had refused to sign the statement. In my view, what Elwin said in response was not objectively an inducement and I found that it was insufficient to give the accused any reasonable grounds for supposing that he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature to sign statement J.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201">201&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused claimed that he complained to the court that statement J was false after he was produced in court. The Notes of Evidence recorded at the first mention show the accused’s complaint related only to the cautioned statement. He told the court that he disputes the charge and alleged that he was told in a threatening manner “I am supposed to sign the charge.” He made no complaint with respect to statement J. I therefore rejected the accused’s evidence that he had complained about statement J.</a></p><a id="p1_201"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201"></a><a id="p1_202">202&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence of Malliga was that Elwin was typing when she was interpreting the accused’s answers. She stated frankly that she did not have to interpret every question and answer of the accused as the accused sometimes answered in English. She interpreted the statement upon conclusion. The accused wanted to make certain amendments which were accordingly made. On her evidence, the accused did not refuse to sign the statement. I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt the voluntariness of statement J and it was admitted as P33.</a></p><a id="p1_202"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence of DW2 – Danaraj s/o Pichanayagam (‘Raj’)</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_202"></a><a id="p1_203">203&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raj was a worker at Jaiho Club from April 2015 until the MOM inspection in June 2016.

In a country like ours, where workers enter legitimately on a work pass, labour trafficking takes on a more subtle form. The means set out in s 3 of the PHTA go beyond the traditional practices of forced labour, such as slave-like practices. Its intent is to bring it in line with international standards on trafficking in persons.</a></p><a id="p1_212"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_212"></a><a id="p1_213">213&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is undisputed that the three dancers were harboured at the Club. They stayed in a room which had a signage ‘storeroom’ at the third floor. Apart from accommodation, they depended on the accused for their daily meals and necessities. They worked daily without any off-day and their passports and work permits were kept by the accused. The issue is whether they were harboured by means of coercion and for the purpose of exploitation, <em>i.e.</em> to place them under servitude to work for the accused on the terms he dictated.</a></p><a id="p1_213"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_213"></a><a id="p1_214">214&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 2 of the PHTA defines ‘coercion’. The definition makes it clear that the use of a threat can be “violent or otherwise”. I accepted the prosecution’s submission that ‘physical restraint’ should not be restricted to the application of manual means to restrain a person but encompass rules to restrain a person’s freedom of movement. The prosecution’s case was that in order to keep the dancers in his employment, the accused had rendered them physically and psychologically unable to leave their employment by four means of subjugation, which were particularised as:</a></p><a id="p1_214"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_214"></a><a id="p1_214-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curtailment of freedom of movement such that the dancers were not allowed to go out of the premises on their own.</a></p><a id="p1_214-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_214-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_214-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threat to frame for theft, putting the dancers in fear of disobeying the accused.</a></p><a id="p1_214-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_214-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_214-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threat of physical harm if they returned to India without approval, putting the dancers in fear of leaving their employment without the accused’s approval.</a></p><a id="p1_214-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_214-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_214-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threat to send videos to the dancers’ families of their interaction with customers, putting the dancers in fear of disobeying the accused.</a></p><a id="p1_214-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_214-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_215">215&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards exploitation, section 2 of the PHTA defines ‘servitude’.

The defence claimed that he is truthful because he gave evidence against the accused, example, he said that he was asked to sign payment vouchers without the payment of any salary. In my judgment, Baskar had a clear self-interest in stating his salary was still outstanding and his testimony in that regard did not vouch for his credibility.</a></p><a id="p1_219"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_219"></a><a id="p1_220">220&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prosecution contradicted Baskar’s evidence that there were no restrictions placed on the dancers to go out with his prior statement (P23) that he gave to MOM. Putting this statement aside first, the evidence of Baskar was that when the dancers were hungry in the afternoon, they did not go out to buy food but would ask him to do so. Asked why he did not ask the dancers to do so themselves, his response was that it never occurred to him. This was clearly an unacceptable response because he was aroused from his sleep to make the trips. I found that he had to go out and buy food because the dancers were not allowed to go out unaccompanied.

He alleged that he was threatened by an unknown male Chinese officer who was present throughout the recording that he had worked illegally before he obtained his work permit. I rejected this allegation. It is not in dispute that Baskar had an in-principle approval (‘IPA’) issued to him which enabled him to travel and work here before the physical copy of the work permit was issued. Further, Baskar had worked here previously and knew that he could start work the day after he arrived on an IPA. It is therefore indeed absurd that he would be threatened with a spurious claim which he would have known was false.</a></p><a id="p1_226"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_226"></a><a id="p1_227">227&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also rejected his claim that he was shouted at and was afraid. Baskar accepted the statement was interpreted in Tamil. He paid attention to the interpretation and had no fear in pointing inaccuracies in the statement. At [8], he pointed out it should be in the month of May and not March as was recorded. For photograph 17, it was recorded that the tips are for the ‘company’ and it was changed to ‘Bala’ when Baskar said the accused collected and held onto the tips. For photographs 23 to 25, the words “sometimes the padlock” were deleted, at his request.</a></p><a id="p1_227"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_227"></a><a id="p1_228">228&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, I found that Baskar was the author of statement P23 and he had failed to satisfactorily explain the contradictions between his evidence and the prior statement. I found that his credit was impeached and substituted Baskar’s testimony with the inconsistent underlined contents of his previous statement as substantive evidence under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act.</a></p><a id="p1_228"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_228"></a><a id="p1_229">229&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Baskar’s evidence that he did not hear the accused threatening the dancers whilst he was present near to where the accused had his meetings with the dancers after the daily shows, Baskar was not a participant at the meetings but was “going over the sales of the liquor, counting the money that I received from the customers”. It would indeed be surprising that he paid attention to every detail of what was said at the meetings for him to testify that no threats were made at the meetings. In any case, it was not the evidence of the dancers that the threats were only made during such meetings. Accordingly, I did not find Baskar’s evidence to be of any assistance on what transpired between the accused and the dancers.</a></p><a id="p1_229"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Credibility of Raj</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_229"></a><a id="p1_230">230&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raj does not have a permanent place of abode. He was clearly beholden to the accused who has assisted him financially and allowed him to work and stay at the club. I did not find Raj to be a credible witness. He claimed that he had seen the dancers going out alone. Asked how often he saw them going out, he said he was not sure. He later said that he saw them going out after the club closes at 3am to shop at Mustafa. But when asked to state clearly when he saw the girls going out, he became less certain and said, “That, I’m not sure when I see them going down.” Thereafter he said they would go out at 5pm and return by 7pm. Subsequently, he retracted that they went out after 3am. He claimed the dancers went out three to four times in a month between 5pm to 7pm to shop. When it was pointed out that the accused has said in his MOM statement that he did not allow them to go out on their own, Raj said they went nearby to the Hanifa store. It was then highlighted that he had given three versions; first, that he did not know where they went, second that they went to Mustafa for shopping, and third, they went to Hanifa. Raj then changed his evidence again by claiming they also sometimes went to Mustafa.</a></p><a id="p1_230"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_230"></a><a id="p1_231">231&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from his inconsistent evidence on when and where the dancers went to, Raj’s evidence was contradicted by Baskar, Velloor and even by the accused that the dancers were not allowed to leave the Club unaccompanied. On Raj’s evidence, the dancers had never opened the Club door for him. He said that either Baskar or the accused would be in the Club and he would call them to open it. His evidence that he found the Club door open three or four times when he returned in the afternoon was contrary to that of the other witnesses who all testified that the Club door would only be opened during prayer time in the evening and during the opening hours of the Club.</a></p><a id="p1_231"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Assessment of the evidence of the dancers and the accused</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_231"></a><a id="p1_232">232&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused was a deliberately difficult witness.

She received 70,000 Rupees (about S$1,400) in India, and was required to earn S$12,500 in collections (roughly 8 times what she had received) in return for that sum. Thereafter, she was entitled to a quarter of her collections. The thrust of her evidence was that she was in fear of the accused. The accused expected her and the other dancers to abide by everything he said. He blackmailed them with threats and also treated them in a demeaning way.</a></p><a id="p1_233"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_233"></a><a id="p1_234">234&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no motive alleged by the defence against TA to give adverse evidence against the accused. Under cross-examination, she gave favourable evidence for the defence. However, her core evidence was that she could not leave the Club without the permission of the accused and she was asked to pay 200,000 Rupees (about $4,000) if she wanted to go back to India. As she was unable to raise that amount, she resigned herself to continue working at the Club for the sake of her children. In re-examination, she was cross-examined on her previous statements which she gave to MOM. She affirmed the truth of the contents of the statements.</a></p><a id="p1_234"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_234"></a><a id="p1_235">235&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under further cross-examination she was referred to her police statement (D65) that she gave on 31 May 2016. Her explanation for the contents in D65 makes it clear on what was operating on her mind when she gave the statement in favour of the accused. She explained that after the police came to the Club, the accused said to her:<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2" frame="none" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="10.38%"><col width="89.62%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p> </td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Anyone ask you about me, you just say the positive things.

On the other hand, he told the dancers that wherever you want to go, I can bring you out<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a>. There was an incoherence in the accused’s version simply because the dancers would not need to ask to go out if they could go out unaccompanied.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_241">241&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I disbelieved the accused that the dancers could go out on their own. In cross-examination, he conceded at one stage that apart from CV, the other dancers also wanted freedom. The question and answer is set out below:<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Bala, so, what I’m saying is, it was not just CV who was complaining. The other girls were also having this issue about freedom, because in your 1st sentence, you’d referred to the girls in the plural, “I will tell them. I will sometimes have a quarrel with them if they insist”. This is all in the plural, “them”, “they”, “them”.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I agree. But the main person who complained is CV.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="">In his police statement P34, in answer to question 3 if the girls had complained that they wanted to go out, he answered: “<em>Yes. They have told us they wanted freedom. I am responsible for the girls and I do not want anything or any allegations against me because of these girls. As such, I do not let them out of the club unless I bring them out myself.”</em> In [6] of his statement P33, he said “<em>I wish to state that I do not allow them to go out on their own as I am afraid they go find the customer or work as prostitute outside. I will bring out when I am free</em>.” It is thus abundantly clear that the accused had prohibited the dancers from going out on their own.</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_242">242&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence of TA was clear that she could not go out as she liked even to buy what she needed<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a>. She said that none of the dancers could leave the premises, even if they wanted to go downstairs for five minutes. In her statement P12, she stated at [6] that she was told on the day of her arrival by the accused that she “cannot go out on my own and I am only allowed to be in the club and my rest place upstairs”. I found this to be true. Consistent with the fact that she was not allowed to go out on her, she also did not have any means to go out. She did not have any money as she was not allowed to keep any portion of her collections and was not paid any salary. Her passport and work permit were also kept by the accused under lock and key. I rejected the evidence of the accused that the work permits and passports of the dancers were not kept under lock and key. I accepted Elwin’s evidence that the work permits were in the cash machine which the accused opened with a key from his pocket. With respect to the passports, they were in a drawer which was locked with a padlock. Elwin directed a photograph to be taken (photo 12 in P2) of the drawer in which the passports and personal phones of the dancers were kept. The hinge used to padlock the drawer is visible in the photograph.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_243">243&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of the evidence centered on whether the premises were locked and why the accused curtailed the freedom of the dancers to go out on their own. TA maintained the rear door was locked with a padlock. This was consistent with Baskar’s evidence. The objective evidence of the padlock on the rear door in the photographs P2 supports their evidence in this regard. As for the Club door, the accused claimed that he would only padlock it from the outside when no one was in the Club. This was contradicted by Baskar’s statement P23 where he said at [7] that he was told by the accused to ensure that the doors are locked when he and the accused are not in the Club. Baskar had no incentive to lie about this in his statement.</a></p><a id="p1_243"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_243"></a><a id="p1_244">244&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TA gave inconsistent evidence on whether the Club door was locked. In examination-in-chief she said the Club door was padlocked from the inside. In cross-examination, based on the photographs, she said it had a twist lock. She also said that it was not padlocked from the inside until after CV came because CV always wanted to go out. It was TA’s evidence that she had tried to open the Club door once when there was no padlock on the inside but was unable to as there was “something small attached”. The following narration of what she did on the following day after a quarrel with the accused clearly showed that she was recounting what she had experienced and was not giving a fabricated account<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a>:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Upon seeing the bouncers and all that, I got very scared.

At that point in time, this padlock was not there.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">I’m referring to D1. I tried pressing the handle, pushing it, it could not open. Then I went to the rear, then I saw a small padlock hanging there. I realised that there’s no way that I could leave this place and the other girls also chided me that, “You know, you cannot try to leave this place since you are already here. Jaiho itself is like a big jail. Once you are caught in his clutches, you can only leave when he releases you. You just have to go along with him and only if he likes you---he’ll take good care of you only if he likes you. Otherwise, he would torture you and reduce you to nothing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_245">245&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from verbally telling the dancers the rule that they are not allowed to go out on their own, the accused had also ensured that the rule was complied with by instructing Baskar that the dancers are not allowed to go out on their own. In addition, he instructed Baskar to padlock the Club door when he and Baskar were not in. There were thus clear restrictions on the freedom of movement of the dancers. With regard to the accused’s justification that there was prostitution in the area as there were a lot of clubs and it was his duty to ensure the safety of the dancers, I found the justification to curtail the freedom of the dancers to go out of their place of accommodation on their own to be unacceptable.</a></p><a id="p1_245"> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(b) <em>Threat to frame for theft</em></p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_245"></a><a id="p1_246">246&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TA’s evidence was that the accused expected complete obedience from all the dancers. He did not want anyone to talk back. She testified that the accused said that if they were to talk back or did not listen to him, he may put some things in their bag and allege to the police they have committed theft.

The threat was to send videos of the dancers interacting with customers to their family members in India. TA’s evidence under cross-examination was that the accused did not threaten to send videos of her interactions with customers. In the further cross-examination, she said he had threatened the other dancers. In re-examination, when she was contradicted with her previous statement P12, she claimed that she was unable to remember the threats due to the passage of time. She then testified that the accused had threatened to send the recordings of dancers hugging customers whilst dancing by saying “<em>I will send it to your family. I’ll send it to your husband. Shall I do that</em>?” According to her, the last occasion when she heard the accused saying that was when he had a ‘fight’ with KR, and he threatened her “<em>Shall I send the video, entire video, to your husband?</em>”</a></p><a id="p1_254"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_254"></a><a id="p1_255">255&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She confirmed the following contents of her statement P12 were accurate as it was given closer to the incidents:</a></p><a id="p1_255"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;… we were all threatened by Bala.

In the club, Bala is like the lord and we cannot go against him. He is the superior and he had made it known to us by intimidating me and other girls. Bala constantly has his phone to take pictures or videos of us and he told us the whole place is under CCTV surveillance. He constantly threatens me and other girls that if we disobey him, he will send the photos of us behaving intimately with customers to our family to destroy us and ruin us. He had made use of our emotions and family back at home to threaten us to make us feel scared. … I tried to please Bala to prevent him from attacking me with threats and hopefully to gain his favour.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;… However, now I felt free from their clutches as Bala is arrested and I do not stay with Baska anymore hence I am willing to tell all the truth I know.

The evidence of TA, CV and KR that a solo dance for which a customer paid $50 involved dancing with the customer on stage was not challenged. I rejected the belated change in position taken by the accused. I accepted the following submissions by the prosecution as to why the accused’s evidence ought to be rejected:</a></p><a id="p1_260"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">118&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, if the accused did in fact have such a rule that the customers cannot touch the dancers, he could easily have enforced the rules given the Defence’s case that there were bouncers present when troublemakers were present at the Club, and there would have been no incidents of customers touching victims.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">119&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it is clear from Exhibit P7 that there were records of solo dance where the collection was $50, group dance where the collection was $10 for each dancer, and a dance involving one dancer where the collection was $10. Unsurprisingly, the accused could not explain why there was such a difference between the entries involving a $10 solo dance and a $50 solo dance. He stated that the entries involving one dancer’s name and $10 were likely mistakes. This is directly contradicted by his own evidence that he would cross check the records in Exhibit P7 to ensure that they were accurate and would then put a tick against the entries. The entry on 3 April 2016 where Devi collected $10 for solo dance had such a tick, which meant that the accused had cross checked the entry and confirmed that it was accurate. The clear inference to be made is that there was in fact a distinction between the $10 solo dances and the $50 solo dances and the difference can be attributed to the fact that the customers could dance with the victims in $50 solo dances.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_260"></a><a id="p1_261">261&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TA testified consistently that customers would dance with her during a solo dance.

Her answers varied from the accused did not tell her to dance intimately, gave her a choice, and he told her to do so. Her explanation for the inconsistent evidence was as follows<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a>:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">I find it very difficult to talk about these sexual matters.

But now, after being pressed on this question again and again, I’m informing this Court. This’s why I am now coming open and I’m telling. I’m putting my shame aside and I’m telling this Court about what would actually---the customers would actually do.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_263">263&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TA’s evidence that she could not have danced with physical contact without the permission of the accused is unmistakably true. This is because the accused was in the Club during the operations and he would watch the dancers dancing. Her evidence that she could bring in collections only if she allowed the customers to touch her whilst dancing was also candid. I accepted her evidence that she started to dance intimately with all customers “<em>Because Bala (accused) made noise that I was not dancing in the same way that I was dancing with that guy. So when he said that, I started to dance in the same manner with all of them</em>.”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a> Accordingly, I found answer 3 of her statement P14 which she gave in the following terms when questioned by MOM to be true:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have one regular customer who tips me well for me to achieve my target. And I only allow this one customer to kiss and touch me at my breast and backside area. Thus, I have no problem achieving my targets. Bala did not like me to entertain only 1 customer and only allow this 1 customer to touch. Bala then scolded me and told me to let other customers touch me also. He had scolded me in a threatening voice. Say that I am not that decent woman, and ask me not to act decent. Bala then threaten to ban my favourite customer who tip me a lot from coming to the club. After sometime, I gave in and allowed the other customers to touch me.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Withholding monthly salary for the duration of employment</em> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_264">264&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not in dispute that the salary of the dancers was declared as $800 in the application for work permit. It is also not in dispute that the dancers were not paid a monthly salary. In respect of the payment vouchers in P11, I accepted the unchallenged evidence of TA, CV and KR that they were asked to sign the vouchers at one go in May 2016. Whilst no salary was paid to the dancers, the accused attempted to explain the vouchers by claiming that the vouchers reflected an apportionment of the advance payment. I disbelieved the accused. First, it is undisputed that the dancers were never told that the advance payments were calculated based on the alleged salary amount. Second, the uncontroverted fact is that the total amount stated in the vouchers does not tally with the advance payment which the dancers had each received. I rejected the accused’s evidence that TA received an amount of 100,000 Rupees as advance payment. I accepted TA’s evidence that she received 70,000 Rupees advance payment. This was consistent with what KR testified she received. It was not in dispute that CV received a lower sum. She stated that she received 50,000 Rupees, which was higher than the 40,000 Rupees which the accused said. Returning to TA, the 70,000 Rupees was equivalent to about SGD1,489 at the then prevailing exchange rate. The amount of the three vouchers total SGD2,026.60 which is far in excess of the advance payment. Second, the accused’s assertion was inconsistent with his evidence that it was a mutual agreement that the dancers would not receive a salary. In fact, the accused claimed that the dancers did not want a salary but wanted to be remunerated on a target basis, i.e. they had to, example, earn S$17,000 first if they received 100,000 Rupees to be entitled to 40 percent of the collections. I found that the dancers did not have a say on how they wished to be remunerated. I accepted the evidence of the dancers that the terms of the target payment were not as stated by the accused. They had to earn the target amount first before they were entitled to a cut from their earnings beyond that target sum. According to TA, she had to earn SGD 12,800 first, which was about 8 times more than the advance payment. In fact, the accused was not paying them from the profits of the business. He was merely utilising the tips which the dancers earned to pay them a fraction of the tips. This was a clear exploitation of the circumstances of the dancers.</a></p><a id="p1_264"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_264"></a><a id="p1_265">265&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, TA stated that her statements P12, P13 and P14 were accurate.

Her evidence was supported by KR who testified that CV did not have the company’s phone on that day and she was asking the accused for it. She said that CV asked to use her (KR) phone but she did not allow her to do so.

As CV was an employee, she was entitled to a monthly salary.</a></p><a id="p1_281"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_281"></a><a id="p1_282">282&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the accused’s arrangement was that CV had to earn SGD8,000 for the 50,000 rupees. This was from the tips which she received from customers for the dance performance. Instead of the tips belonging to her, the accused treated the tips as belonging to the Club and required her to earn about seven times more than what she had received. This was clear exploitation of CV.</a></p><a id="p1_282"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Charge relating to KR</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_282"></a><a id="p1_283">283&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thrust of the defence case was that KR gave adverse evidence because she was angry that the accused had sent audio clips of messages from a customer to her husband on 15 June 2016, and that her credit ought to be impeached because her evidence was contrary to her police statement made on 31 July 2016 (D69) and her conversation with one Anitha in June 2016. I was satisfied that KR gave a satisfactory explanation for the contradictions between her police statement and what she told Anitha and found that her credit was not impeached.</a></p><a id="p1_283"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_283"></a><a id="p1_284">284&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KR was candid that her relationship with the accused was good for about one month.

Then after that, he showed his true colours</em>.” She described his erratic behaviour as akin to a ‘psycho’. In similar vein to TA, she testified that the accused simply wanted to assert his authority and make the dancers do his bidding.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_285">285&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to her police statement, I accepted her evidence that her encounter with the police was something “new” and the “foremost thing” that she was feeling when she answered the questions was fear. She said the accused had handed TA a handphone and she suspected that she was communicating with the accused. The following evidence on what was operating on her mind had a clear impress of truth<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a>:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The first time when I was giving the statement, I didn’t know anything about this, I was frightened of saying anything against him and I was afraid that I maybe stopped from going back to India.

I was totally afraid of saying anything against him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_286">286&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learned counsel questioned her on Answer 3 where she said “We do not ask to go out.” and answer 16 where in response to the question if she felt that she was prevented from leaving the ‘house’, she answered, “No, not really.”, whereas her evidence in court was that she and the other dancers were denied permission to go to the temple. I did not find anything to turn on this discrepancy. In the same answer (Answer 3), she stated that the “The rules was as such, that we had to stay in the house…” unless the accused brought them out. Her evidence that the dancers wanted to go to the temple was consistent with TA and CV’s evidence.</a></p><a id="p1_286"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_286"></a><a id="p1_287">287&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards answer 4 where she said “We are not allowed to go down from the stage.” and answer 16 that the accused “does not let us talk to the customer”, it was TA and CV’s evidence that they had to shake hands with the customers and make calls to customers to invite them to the club. The accused confirmed that dancers wrote their phone number on pieces of paper for customers (see P4) or gave it to customers to write their numbers. He said that if the dancers were to “…do such things, then the customers would come back, it would improve our business.”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a> Answers 4 and 16 were therefore untrue statements as testified to by KR.

I did not agree that this was a complaint, or that it suggested that KR was not fearful of speaking against the accused. In question 8, she was asked about the rules and stated how the dancers were rewarded for doing well. She naturally had to state the corollary of not doing well. It is also significant that the answer was consistent with the fact that KR did not have a phone with her when the police came and the phone was retrieved from the accused with the assistance of the police.</a></p><a id="p1_288"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_288"></a><a id="p1_289">289&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards answer 9 where she said there was not much issue and she felt protected by the accused, which she said was untrue, it is clear that KR was not simply recanting her statement. She was candid in testifying that the accused would sometimes speak nicely to her and had not hit her. With regard to answer 10, it was claimed by the defence that KR had in fact complained to the police that the accused locked the door from the outside and the main door was locked from the inside at night. I accepted KR’s evidence that this was stated matter-of-factly. In fact, what is significant is that she did not reveal her true feelings and instead said, “I did not feel that I was confined or anything.”. The statement that she did not feel confined although she did not have the freedom to step out alone cannot be a normal reaction. This clearly supported KR’s evidence that she was in fear in of speaking against the accused.</a></p><a id="p1_289"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_289"></a><a id="p1_290">290&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer 11, she stated that she did not see the accused hit the other dancers. Although the defence had placed emphasis on the fact that the question referred to the dancers being non-compliant, the fact of the matter was that both CV and ‘Devi’ were hit and despite that KR stated that she did not see anything. This again showed her reluctance to state anything adverse against the accused due to her fear as she testified.</a></p><a id="p1_290"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_290"></a><a id="p1_291">291&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to the conversation which KR had with Anitha and a third unknown person after the accused’s arrest by MOM. The conversation took place at the hostel where KR was housed by MOM and it was recorded by Anitha. It is not in dispute that the accused knows Anitha. He initially referred to Anitha as a relative and later said she is a friend. KR knew that Anitha was recording their conversation at the behest of the accused. She said<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a>:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">And MOM has sent us to a place, a safe place.

KR was not allowed to leave the premises without permission and could only do so accompanied by the accused or the other men in the club.

She did not exaggerate and said that he made this threat only once. She also confirmed that the accused did not take the photograph but had only threatened her. I found that this was not an allegation which she had trumped up.

In particular, I accepted the following evidence:<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has---he has also threatened to put it on Facebook.

I rejected the accused’s evidence that the audio recordings were sent to him by Anitha.

She was unable to repay the amount. She asked him to calculate the collections that she has received so that she could pay the balance. However, the accused did not do the calculation. She also asked if she could repay him after she has been sent back. The accused did not agree.

He agreed that if a dancer was able to draw in the crowd, the collections from the tips and liquor sales would increase. From the audio-recording (see transcript P9), it is apparent that the accused was checking the phones of dancers to ascertain if they were calling customers. KR told the accused, “<em>I am talking to the customers, sir</em>.” (pg 2). The accused then remarked to her “<em>Let us see. If this continues I will give you only company phone</em>.” He next asked another dancer, ‘Abi’, and said “<em>No problems. Made many calls</em>.” He then asked where another dancer ‘Devi’ was. He said to her “<em>Come here how many call you make today? You did not call anybody. You made calls for namesake. You just dial cancel the call and put down the phone</em>.” He then turned to CV and said there were still a lot of missed calls. He continued ‘<em>There are many calls. Just like ‘Devi’ 0 minutes. We are checking so make calls for namesake. Just made calls then cut the line.</em>” The accused said “<em>Show some interest. We are going down. I need to pay $15,000 rent in 15 day time. How to pay?</em>” In his statement P33, at [8], the accused said, “<em>I also asked them to keep contact numbers of customers of the club.

She said that some customers would hold her hands and ask her to twirl, some would hug her and some would place their hands on her chest. I accepted her candid evidence that she was compelled to allow the customers to touch during solo dances because if she did not, she will not be able to earn $50 for each solo dance, as the opportunity will go to another dancer, like TA, and she will also not be able to receive the company phone if she did not earn $100 per day.

She was asked to sign the payment voucher in P11 dated 3 May 2016 for the amount of $585 and was told that it was payment to the government for her. I accepted her evidence that she was told that for an advance payment of 100,000 Rupees in India, she would have to earn SGD12,800 within six months. However, she received only 70,000 Rupees. She was to be entitled to 10 per cent of her collections only after she had earned the target sum. This clearly reflected a gross underpayment and exploitation.</a></p><a id="p1_300"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_300"></a><a id="p1_301">301&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the photographs of outings and a birthday celebration tendered by the defence, I accepted the prosecution’s submissions at [133]:</a></p><a id="p1_301"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Defence also tendered photographs (Exhibit D1-D43) depicting the victims looking happy on various outings and a birthday celebration. Just because the victims looked happy in the photographs did not mean that the conditions at work and the Club were good. There were clearly other instances which showed otherwise – as evident in Exhibit P9 and P9T. Just because the victims were sometimes treated well by the accused did not mean that they were not also subject to unreasonable and unlawful demands and various kinds of abuses. It certainly does not detract from the fact that the offences detailed above were committed. Further, it is also clear that any benefits were purely at the whim of the accused and the victims could just as easily incur the wrath of the accused over any small misstep. Pertinently, there is also no legal requirement that labour trafficking must involve an unremitting and unchanging hellscape of suffering for its victims. To hold thus would be a great disservice to the victims, as it would give them justice only when they are faced with unrelenting torture, when in reality, human traffickers can sometimes be nice to their victims for various reasons.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_301"></a><a id="p1_302">302&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the evidence in totality, the cumulative effect of the scheme was that the victims were trapped in the situation they found themselves in on the terms decided by the accused, and had no alternative but to continue working and complying with the accused. I found it safe to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had used coercive means for the purpose of ensuring that the dancers had no choice but to continue to work for him on the terms dictated by him. Accordingly, the accused was found guilty and convicted on the three charges.</a></p><a id="p1_302"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Address on Sentence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_302"></a><a id="p1_303">303&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prosecution sought a global imprisonment term of five years and $31,200 fine.

They were also convicted of Women’s Charter offences relating to one of the victims. There were eight charges under s 3(1) PHTA and 10 Women’s Charter offences which were taken into consideration for sentence. The PHTA charges related to harbouring the three victims by means of abuse of power and the nature of exploitation was servitude. They were each sentenced to an aggregate of five years and six months’ imprisonment and with total fines of $7,500 fine.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_305">305&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Public Prosecutor v BSR</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24855-SSP.xml')">[2020] 4 SLR 335</a> (‘BSR’), the offender faced, inter alia, one charge of recruiting his wife for the purpose of sexual exploitation, by placing her in fear of being physically assaulted if she refused to prostitute herself, an offence under s 3(1)(a) and punishable under s 4(1)(a) PHTA and another charge of knowingly receiving payments in connection with the sexual exploitation of his wife, an offence under s 6(1) and punishable under s 6(2)(a) of the PHTA. The offending took place over less than three months. She earned an estimated $10,930 through prostitution. He pleaded guilty. Having regard to the high level of harm and culpability, the accused was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment, three strokes of the cane, and $6,000 fine for the s 3(1)(a) PHTA offence.

As a starting point, the court may presume that the entire revenue received by the offender represents his profits. From the revenue, the court should only permit a deduction for necessary expenses, i.e. expenses the sole purpose of which was to enable the offender to commit the offence: <em>Joel Su</em> at [61] and [63].

Learned counsel submitted that the factual matrix in <em>BPR</em> was more egregious than the instant case. First, in <em>BPR</em>, the accused persons had applied significant pressure for the victims to offer sexual services and one of the victims did so. In contrast, the accused did not allow the victims to provide such services. Second, in BPR, the victim’s personal communication with the outside world was cut-off by confiscation of their personal phones. In contrast, the victims in the instant case were issued with the company’s phone which they used to contact their customers and families.

It is trite that the court ought to consider the full spectrum of sentences enacted by Parliament in determining the appropriate sentence (<em>Poh Boon Kiat</em>&nbsp;v <em>Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17081-SSP.xml')">[2014] 4 SLR 892</a> at [60]). In calibrating the sentence, the following set of factors are relevant to assess the seriousness of the offending: the period of harbouring, the level of vulnerability of the victims, the number of victims, the nature and degree of coercion exercised upon the victims to maintain control over them, the nature and degree of exploitation, the level of sophistication and planning of the scheme, and the accused’s role.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_321">321&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sentences imposed in <em>BPR</em> and <em>BSR</em> which have been upheld on appeal are useful indicators. BSR is a far more egregious case where both harm and culpability were found to be high. <em>BPR</em> is broadly analogous to the instant case but it has more aggravating factors. First, there was deception in that the victims were promised jobs as PAs. Second, the victims were expected to provide sexual services. Third, they did not have any means of communication with their families. Fourth, the number of PHTA charges was higher; 11 in total, three proceeded with and the remaining charges were TIC-ed. In <em>BPR</em>, the individual sentence for V1 who was harboured for about five months was four years’ imprisonment and fine of $2,500, for V2 who was harboured for two weeks’ and V3 who was harboured for close to two months, two years’ imprisonment and $2,500 fine each. The four-year sentence for V1 was ordered to run consecutively with a Women’s Charter charge. The total sentence was 5 years and 6 months’ imprisonment with a fine of $7,500, in default six weeks’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_321"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_321"></a><a id="p1_322">322&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, the prosecution sought a total sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment. In comparison to <em>BPR</em>, I found the level of harm and culpability to be lower. Accordingly, I did not agree with the sentences proposed by the prosecution. I noted the period of harbouring and the exploitative conditions under which the victims were held. Their poor economic conditions in India were exploited by paying them an advance payment in return for which they had to earn a ‘target’ sum which was about seven times more for the Club. They were not allowed to go out on their own even to buy necessities and were totally dependent on the accused. Their personal handphones were taken away. They were required to earn $100 per day to be entitled to use the company’s phones. They were required to permit customers to touch them during solo dance performances for which the customers paid $50. Threats were made to ensure compliance and they were unable to terminate their employment to return back as they were unable to pay the amounts demanded. Their passports were confiscated and their work permits were never provided to them. They were thus trapped to continue working every night with no off day and with non-payment of salary. The accused played the primary role in the entire scheme, exercising control and authority over the victims.</a></p><a id="p1_322"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_322"></a><a id="p1_323">323&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In calibrating the individual sentences, I made adjustments for the custody period from 15th June 2016 to 5th July 2016 when the accused was released on bail and the totality principle taking into account the in default sentences for the mandatory fines. Accordingly, I arrived at individual sentences of 26 months’ imprisonment for TA, 15 months’ imprisonment for KR and 21 months’ imprisonment for CV. The 26-month and the 15-month terms were ordered to run consecutively, making a total sentence of 41 months’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_323"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_323"></a><a id="p1_324">324&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to the imposition of the fines. Whilst there was a financial assistance memo dated 14 December 2020 tendered in respect of the accused’s hospital bills, I was not satisfied that by itself established that the accused is impecunious. The accused stated in his evidence that he is employed as a chef. He said he had a good reputation in Little India because he has several businesses there. Specifically, he mentioned he had a ‘side business’ of exporting laptops and of electronic appliances whilst he was running the Club. In any case, this is not a case where a fine is discretionary. As a fine is mandatory, the primary purpose was to disgorge the financial gains to ensure that the accused is not better off by reason of having committed the offences.</a></p><a id="p1_324"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_324"></a><a id="p1_325">325&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recorded tips were earned by the victims during their dance performances. They were directly related to the offending. In fact, these amounts were given to the victims by the customers and rightfully belonged to them instead of the Club. The accused agreed that he required dancers to draw in the customers. This resulted in increased sales of liquor. However, there was no reliable way of calculating the monthly revenue earned from the sale of liquor which was attributable to the dancers. Accordingly, the tips earned by the victims was a very conservative approach in determining the benefits derived from the offending.</a></p><a id="p1_325"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_325"></a><a id="p1_326">326&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I disagreed that the accused’s so-called monthly ‘salary’ of $3,000 should represent the ceiling for the calculation of the profits earned. The accused was not an employee. He was a partner of the business with Krishna and he had a stake in the revenue of the Club.</a></p><a id="p1_326"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_326"></a><a id="p1_327">327&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the deduction for necessary expenditure, it is undisputed that the food expenditure for the three victims should be permitted to be deducted. The dispute related to the quantum of the expenditure per day that should be allowed. I found the daily figure of $50 per victim suggested by the defence to be excessive. The prosecution suggested $10 per day for each victim. In my view, an amount of $12 per day for each victim is reasonable. Accordingly, for TA, the figure was worked out to be $1,440, in respect of KR, $624 and for CV, $960. In respect of the cosmetic expenses, I gave the accused credit for the proposed sum of $300 per victim. In respect of the phone top-ups, the burden was on the accused to provide the evidence. No such evidence was provided and in fact the evidence indicated otherwise. Accordingly, I disallowed this expenditure.</a></p><a id="p1_327"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_327"></a><a id="p1_328">328&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of the tips recorded in P7 totalled $20,0346 for TA, $6,5107 for KR and $4,7458 for CV. After deducting the expenditure, I imposed a fine of $18,294 in respect of TA, $5,586 in respect of KR and $3,485 in respect of CV. The total in default sentence of 20 weeks’ was calculated to ensure that the overall sentence combined with the imprisonment term would not be disproportionate.</a></p><a id="p1_328"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_328"></a><a id="p1_329">329&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the compensation order, s 359 CPC imposes an obligation upon the court to consider whether or not to order compensation and to make such an order if it considers it appropriate to do so (<em>Tay Wee Kiat v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22534-SSP.xml')">[2018] 5 SLR 438</a> 1 (‘<em>Tay Wee Kiat’</em>). TA, KR and CV received an advance payment. No other payments were made to them. Considering the principles in <em>Tay Wee Kiat</em>, I found the imposition of a compensation order to be appropriate. The victims were from a poor financial background. They belong to a class of victims for whom it is impractical to commence a civil suit to recover unpaid salary. The amount of unpaid salary is based on the declaration by the accused in the work permit applications and is therefore easily ascertainable. Accordingly, I made an order in respect of the unpaid salary of TA and CV. The amount ordered is not a large sum as to be oppressive. No order was made in respect of KR as her advance payment exceeded the salary she should have received.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>NE 27 September 2018 at p 82, lines 22-26</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>NE 23 August 2017 at p 38, lines 16-20</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>NE 26 March 2018 at pg 33, lines 4-9</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>NE 24 August 2017 at pg 68, lines 22-27</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_5_1" id="Ftn_5">[note: 5]</a></sup>NE 26 March 2018 at pg 46, lines 1-9</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_6_1" id="Ftn_6">[note: 6]</a></sup>NE 29 August 2017 at p 43, lines 6-10</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_7_1" id="Ftn_7">[note: 7]</a></sup>NE 27 March 2018 at p 90, lines 11-18 &amp;
