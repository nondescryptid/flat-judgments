He referred her to the first defendant who was then practising at the fourth defendant’s clinic at Mount Elizabeth Novena Specialist Centre.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first defendant assessed her to have significant functional dentofacial deformities with a protrusive mouth and lips and recommended a bimaxillary jaw surgery to treat her condition, <em>ie</em> a surgery on both upper and lower jaws. This surgery involved cutting the jaw bones and repositioning them so as to address the protrusion and correct the misalignment of the teeth and jaw. The bones would then be secured in place using bone plates, screws and wires.</a></p><a id="p1_3"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff agreed and consented to the procedure which was carried out in December 2015 at the Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital (“MNH”) by both the first and second defendants. The plaintiff’s dentofacial deformities were significantly corrected through the surgery but there was a resultant minor facial asymmetry which caused her to seek a second orthognathic surgery about six months after the first surgery, and subsequently a third surgery eleven months later.</a></p><a id="p1_4"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff instituted this action claiming that the first and second defendants were negligent in the medical care, treatment and advice given to her. She alleges that their mistakes had caused her to have to undergo jaw surgery so many times. She alleges that she suffered, and continues to suffer, pain and discomfort from the surgeries. She claims damages from the defendants including her loss of income as well as the cost of any future treatments and surgeries she may require.</a></p><a id="p1_5"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendants deny the plaintiff’s claim in its entirety. They say that the first surgery had successfully corrected the plaintiff’s dentofacial deformities and the resultant minor residual asymmetry was well within expectations of surgical outcomes. The defendants had repeatedly emphasised to the plaintiff that the aesthetic outcome of orthognathic surgeries can never be predicted with complete certainty and it was unrealistic to expect perfect symmetry when dealing with a complex structure such as the human face. However, after her jaw deformities were corrected and her looks improved, the plaintiff had insisted on proceeding with the second and third surgeries, seemingly due to her quest for aesthetic perfection.</a></p><a id="p1_6"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the defendant’s case that the plaintiff’s dentofacial deformity has been corrected and her overall aesthetic appearance has improved significantly as a result of the surgeries. They say that the plaintiff had been appropriately advised on all relevant and material risks, complications, and alternative treatments in respect of each of the three surgeries carried out. Their diagnosis, care, treatment and management of the plaintiff was reasonable, appropriate, and consistent with acceptable standards of care.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the defendants ask that the plaintiff’s claim against them be dismissed with costs as it is totally without merit.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Chronological background</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Pre-surgery consultation</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff first consulted Dr Cheng on 6 July 2015.

He explained what the procedure would entail and that the entire treatment plan would take approximately two years to execute so this would be a significant undertaking. According to the first defendant, he had, as <em>per</em> his routine practice, explained to the plaintiff the risks and complications associated with such a surgery including pain, discomfort, swelling, nerve injury and numbness. The plaintiff indicated that she would start her pre-surgical orthodontic treatment before commencing any surgical planning and was given an open date to return for a follow-up appointment<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 20 November 2015<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a>, the plaintiff returned to the fourth defendant’s clinic. She was attended to by both the first defendant and the second defendant. A detailed review of her face, jaw and teeth was performed. This entailed taking facial measurements, facebow recordings, upper and lower jaw impressions, wax bites and photographs to document her condition. Her dental x-rays taken at Dr Cheng’s clinic on 19 November 2015 were also reviewed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon consideration of the clinical investigations and findings, the first and second defendants assessed that the plaintiff had a Class I malocclusion with skeletal Class I relationship, severe upper and lower anterior alveolar protrusion resulting in severely proclined anterior teeth and lips, as well as the inability to bite with her front teeth. She also had vertical maxillary excess with gummy smile, jaw canting causing a crooked smile, a retrusive chin and four non-functional wisdom teeth.

They informed her of the risks associated with the surgery which included the risks of wisdom teeth removal such as pain, discomfort, swelling, inferior alveolar nerve injury and permanent numbness to the lips and chin. They also explained to the plaintiff that the 1<sup>st</sup> Surgery might not produce ‘perfect’ results – there might still be residual discrepancies after the surgery as it was not possible to predict the aesthetic outcome of orthognathic surgeries with complete certainty.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff was also advised of the alternative treatment option of orthodontic treatment, <em>ie</em> braces with premolar extractions; however, this would only result in partial compensation and would not fully correct her dentofacial deformity. Only orthognathic surgery would provide her the chance of a full correction of the skeletal disharmony she presented with.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff was keen to undergo the 1<sup>st</sup> Surgery as she wanted a full correction of her dentofacial condition.

They reiterated what had been discussed during the previous consultations with regard to the indications, alternatives, risks and benefits of the 1<sup>st</sup> Surgery. The plaintiff remained keen to proceed. She signed a consent form entitled “Consent for Operation or Procedure<em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></em>, indicating her consent to undergo the stated procedure under general anaesthesia<em>.</em> The 1<sup>st</sup> Surgery was scheduled for 10 December 2015.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 1<sup>st</sup> Surgery</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first and second defendants carried out the 1<sup>st</sup> Surgery on the plaintiff on 10 December 2015 in the Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital (“MNH”). In the course of the procedure which lasted from 4.55pm to 7.50pm, a minor fracture occurred at the right ramus or lower jaw of the plaintiff. Medically, this was described as an “unfavourable fracture” in an otherwise uneventful surgery. The fracture was rectified immediately with a fixation plate and did not compromise the functional or aesthetic results of the 1<sup>st</sup> Surgery. According to the defendants, such minor fractures are not uncommon nor unexpected during a surgery like the 1<sup>st</sup> Surgery as maxillary, mandibular and chin osteotomies involve cutting, reshaping and repositioning of the jaw bones. The surgical manipulation that has to be performed can cause minor fragmentations of bone within the operative area<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the 1<sup>st</sup> Surgery, the plaintiff was seen by the first defendant on 12 December 2015 who noted that she was healing normally, there were no signs and symptoms of infection, and the occlusion was satisfactory.

There was, however, a mild residual canting (or tilting) of the maxilla due to her lips being asymmetrical, but the result was considered to be medically acceptable.

She complained of pain and numbness in the anterior mandible as well as a “hollowing<em>”</em> of her left cheek. On examination, he noted the operation site to be healing well, there were no signs or symptoms of infection, and occlusion was satisfactory.

She complained of pain at her right mandible and “hollowing<em>”</em> at her left mandible / temporomandibular joint area. On examination, she was noted to be healing well. The facial hollowing was assessed to be likely due to a lack of facial fat which was pre-existing before the 1<sup>st</sup> Surgery and could be seen in her preoperative photographs. Since it was less than two months after the 1<sup>st</sup> Surgery, it was not unexpected for the plaintiff to still have some pain or muscle soreness as the healing process takes time and differs from patient to patient. The plaintiff was advised to allow herself some time to heal, and to wait for her facial features to settle down before further assessment.

The first and second defendants examined her and noted that the operation site was healing well, there were no signs or symptoms of infection, and occlusion was satisfactory. At this consultation, she was initially seen by both the first and second defendants, but after she expressed her preference to be treated only by the first defendant, the second defendant no longer participated in her treatment until sometime in April 2017 when he was asked to assist in a subsequent surgery<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the 4 March 2016 consultation, despite having previously agreed to wait for her facial features to settle down after the 1<sup>st</sup> Surgery, the plaintiff voiced her dissatisfaction with the outcome of the surgery and complained that she had a crooked smile. The first defendant ordered further investigations for her including x-rays, photographs of her teeth and face as well as a computed tomography (“CT”) scan of her face. All these investigations showed good skeletal and dental occlusion<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 12 March 2016, the investigation results were shared with the plaintiff. The first defendant reiterated to the plaintiff that the 1<sup>st</sup> Surgery had been successful in functionally correcting her dentofacial deformity. As for the aesthetic outcome, while it was noted that the plaintiff had a canted eye level and zygomatic prominence on the left side, these were not features that were correctible by orthognathic surgery. The occlusal cant of 1.5mm where the left side of the jaw was slightly lower than the right was already present before the 1<sup>st</sup> Surgery, with a rotation of the lower jaw to the right side and chin point lowering on the right side. The first defendant explained that the minor residual asymmetry was well within expectations of surgical outcomes, and that objectively, the aesthetic outcome was very acceptable<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff, however, insisted that the aesthetic outcome was not good enough for her, and she wanted to correct any residual facial asymmetry, even though considered minor. The first defendant then explained that if the plaintiff was not keen to continue with only orthodontic treatment and accept the minor residual asymmetry, then further bimaxillary jaw surgery with a rotation of the upper and lower jaws was a possible treatment option. This would involve a Lefort 1 osteotomy, bilateral sagittal split osteotomy and genioplasty (“2<sup>nd</sup> Surgery”)<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the plaintiff was keen to proceed with the 2<sup>nd</sup> Surgery, the first defendant felt that the plaintiff’s reaction to the minor facial asymmetry was disproportionate to the actual degree of asymmetry present and referred her to see a psychiatrist, Dr Calvin Fones. He had also observed that the plaintiff appeared to have lost a significant amount of weight<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff was next seen by the first defendant on 19 March 2016.

On 28 March 2016, the plaintiff called to inform the clinic that she was currently seeing her own psychologist. The first defendant informed the clinic staff to let the plaintiff know that he would require a report from her psychologist.

Over the course of these consultations, the first defendant explained to the plaintiff the planned surgical movements to be made during the 2<sup>nd</sup> Surgery and that the objective of the surgery was to show less gum and teeth on the left side and to rotate the right side out slightly as well as to increase jaw height on the right side. The possible risks and complications associated with the 2<sup>nd</sup> Surgery were discussed, which included the risk of pain, nerve injury, numbness, residual facial asymmetry after surgery due to the pre-existing soft tissue asymmetry (corner of lip, canted eye level and zygomatic prominence) which could not be fully corrected by skeletal surgery. The first defendant said that he had exercised special care to manage her expectations regarding the surgical outcome due to the fact that the plaintiff had previously indicated that she wanted perfect facial symmetry which he pointed out to her was not a realistic goal<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a> and encouraged the plaintiff to take her time to decide if she wanted to proceed with the 2<sup>nd</sup> Surgery.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2<sup>nd</sup> Surgery was scheduled for 1 June 2016 and the plaintiff signed the requisite Consent Form<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the surgery, the plaintiff signed a “Separation Agreement” dated 26 May 2016 with her then employer, World First Asia Pte Ltd, by which she agreed to a voluntary termination of her employment with waiver of the notice period of one month and payment of a lump sum <em>ex gratia</em> amount.

Some mild prominence of the angle of the mandible on the right side was noted, which had not been observed during or immediately after the 2<sup>nd</sup> Surgery. The protrusion was minor and did not affect the plaintiff functionally and was within surgical expectations. The first defendant explained to the plaintiff that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Surgery had corrected the canting of the upper jaw and a repeat surgery was not recommended.

According to the first defendant, the plaintiff was unhappy with the slight midline deviation to the left, canting of the jaw, and prominence of the right angle of the mandible and felt very strongly that she should have further surgery. The first defendant explained that a further orthognathic surgery was not recommended. The purpose of the original surgery was to achieve functional correction of the dentoskeletal deformity, and this had already been achieved. It was reiterated to her that the minor aesthetic discrepancies were within acceptable limits, and it was not realistic to expect total symmetry or a ‘perfect’ outcome as aesthetics and appearances are subjective.

He had comprehensively dealt with the diagnosis of the plaintiff’s condition, the recommended treatment by the first and second defendants and how the treatment had been carried out.

There has been a significant correction and improvement of the plaintiff’s dentofacial deformity from the 1<sup>st</sup> Surgery. Taking into account the initial severity of the dentofacial deformity, the postoperative functional and aesthetic result for the 1<sup>st</sup> Surgery was clinically acceptable and well within the expectations of surgical outcomes.</a></p><a id="p1_107-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_107-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2<sup>nd</sup> Surgery prescribed to the plaintiff included a Lefort 1 osteotomy, bilateral sagittal split osteotomies and chin parring. The planned surgical movements were aimed at correcting the 1.5mm show of gum / teeth on the left side, rotating the maxilla outwards on the right side (yaw movement) to support the lips; and increasing the ramus height on the right side. As the 1<sup>st</sup> Surgery had already achieved significant functional and aesthetic improvements for the plaintiff, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Surgery was prescribed to address the plaintiff’s minor aesthetic concerns. The post-surgery clinical photographs showed that these aesthetic concerns had been addressed appropriately. However, the surgery had also resulted in an unexpected right mandibular angle prominence. This was difficult to anticipate pre-operatively and might have resulted from the effect of the yaw and cant correction of the maxilla on the mandible. As the prominence was mild, it might not have been readily apparent during the surgery, especially if the bone segments of the mandible were seated passively.</a></p><a id="p1_107-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_107-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 3<sup>rd</sup> Surgery was a segmental Lefort 1 osteotomy, extraction of upper and lower first premolars, lower anterior segmental osteotomy, bilateral sagittal split osteotomies, chin parring and right-angle reduction. The surgical plan and movements were performed to address the complaints presented (teeth do not fit well, upper and lower dental mid-lines deviated to left by 3mm and 1mm, bimaxillary protrusion, lips feel strained/tight, right angle of jaw obvious, and chin in middle of face but right lower chin border more bulbous / lower than left). The post-surgery clinical photographs showed that there was a further correction of the plaintiff’s dentofacial deformity including a correction of the right mandibular angle prominence and the lower right chin border.

This included the monitoring of the plaintiff’s vital signs and pain control throughout her hospital stays, the regular post-operative reviews following her discharge after each of the surgeries, the drugs prescribed to her, further procedures carried out in conjunction with her orthodontic treatment, treatments to address her complaints of numbness and pain as well as the provision of dental services (scaling and cleaning) to maintain her gingival health.

In any case, the plaintiff had been counselled repeatedly that pain, discomfort, numbness and nerve injury were risks associated with the surgeries. She had nonetheless consented to undergo the procedures and cannot now hold them responsible for her alleged suffering. Considering that she had also declined A/Prof Lim’s proposal to see a chronic pain specialist for further management, the veracity of her complaint is in doubt.</a></p><a id="p1_121-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_121-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_121-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for her periodontitis, the first defendant had testified that based on the panoramic x-ray taken by Dr Cheng on 1 March 2018, there was no sign of any periodontal disease. Hence, the periodontal pocketing subsequently found could not be caused by the defendants. The plaintiff had asserted during her cross-examination of the defence witnesses that she had developed periodontitis due to the extended time that she had to wear braces because of the three operations. DW3 was specifically asked by the court for his explanation to which he answered as follows<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a>:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">From what I gather from the X-rays and her notes and Prof Asher Lim’s reports, it doesn’t seem in any way that orthognathic surgery would result in periodontal disease… Prof Lim only 2 reports two areas where she had what we call pocketing: a 5mm 3 pocket on one side and a 7mm pocket on the other side. These were associated with two second lower molars… this condition actually is not a very serious condition.. It is an entirely treatable condition as well. Orthognathic surgery would not result in periodontal pocketing in these areas, for sure.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">… 90 per cent of patients in Singapore will have some form of gum disease or periodontal disease. This is taken from the NDC, National Dental Centre, website. So, the patient can develop periodontal disease for any sort of reasons. In this case, I do not think that it was related to orthognathic surgery. Poor oral hygiene, but unlikely because she had undergone cleaning, regular cleaning, with the dental hygienist at the practice. So, it could have been developed after she stopped seeing Dr Lye, which was in February 2018, and throughout the year where she saw doctor Prof Asher Lim in 2019. So, by then, almost 11 months had passed and she could have developed this disease after. So, there are many factors that could have contributed to that, but I do not think orthognathic surgery would have resulted in that.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="">From the evidence adduced, I would have to find that the plaintiff’s periodontitis was caused by her lack of dental hygiene, and not by the three surgeries performed by the defendants.</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_121-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the plaintiff’s complaint of inability to open her mouth completely, the reported limitation was a mere 5mm only as documented by A/Prof Lim. This was due to the pain at the right masseteric region which is a treatable condition. As she had rejected his offer for chronic pain management by a specialist, the condition may not be as serious as alleged.</a></p><a id="p1_121-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_121-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_121-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, on the plaintiff’s allegation of difficulties with her speech, aside from having no supporting medical evidence, she did not exhibit any such impediment at the trial.

All we have on record is a bare assertion in her statement of claim that she continues to require medical monitoring, care and treatment on account of her jaw and mouth injuries. There is no evidence whatsoever that she has continued to seek medical treatment since she unilaterally stopped her follow-up appointments at the fourth defendant’s clinic.

She did not call her previous employer, World First Asia Pte Ltd, to give evidence, and from the documents exhibited in her AEIC, it appears that she had voluntarily resigned her employment in May 2016 and accepted an <em>ex gratia</em> lump sum payment. Hence, any loss of income would have been self-induced. The belated inclusion of further income documents in her closing submissions is in breach of civil procedural rules, and the court must disregard them. Further, as pointed out in the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant’s Closing Submissions, such a claim is in excess of this court’s jurisdiction.</a></p><a id="p1_124-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_124-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_124-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had also further claimed $99,722.59 for her debt to the bank for her medical expenses, and a further $60,000 as interest paid to the banks for the multiple surgeries. No evidence was adduced as to how these sums are attributable to the defendants’ alleged breaches of duty. At the trial, the plaintiff had also disclosed that her medical bills were in fact covered by insurance.
