He was its project manager. The co-accused is the director of both MCE and Aqua Mart. The case against the accused in main, is based on the three statements<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a> that he had given to the Commercial Affairs Department (“CAD”) on 20 January 2014, 11 July 2014 (two statements), the various SMS messages and e-mail communications with one “Lilian Alves” (“Lilian”). The accused did not challenge the accuracy of the three statements.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime in May 2013, the accused became acquainted with Lilian through <em>Tagged.com</em>, an online dating website. Lilian supposedly owned a gem and jewellery business. In an e-mail dated 20 July 2013 (timed 12:41 AM),<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a> Lilian tried to borrow money from the accused, ostensibly, for her gem business. The accused told PW3, Commercial Affairs Officer Lin Kian Siang (“CAO Lin”), in his statement that he felt that Lilian was trying to get money from him. Further, he did not trust her because she had not shown him any documents and in fact, he had some doubts as to whether Lilian actually owned a gem business. The accused did not provide Lilian with any loan.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, Lilian told the accused that she had just closed her gem business and she needed his bank account number so that the client could transfer monies into his account.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a> The accused stated that he found it strange that Lilian was running a business without a bank account.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Nonetheless he provided his personal account particulars <em>vide</em> an e-mail to Lilian dated 31 July 2013 (timed 6:24 PM)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> because he wanted to help her out. However, Lilian told the accused that the account he provided could not be used to receive monies, but she didn’t explain why it could not. Therefore, no monies were transferred into this account.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his statement, the accused conceded that he found it suspicious that, even though Lilian seemed in need of an account to transfer monies into urgently, she nevertheless failed to provide him with any details as to, for example, who would be transferring monies into the account. In fact, Lilian did not contact him for about one and a half months from mid-August 2013 until the end of September 2013. The accused further conceded that he thought that Lilian was trying to make use of his account for suspicious and illegal activities,<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a> though he did not know what these were. He claimed that he provided Lilian with the account number because he wanted to help her and not because Lilian had promised him a commission for helping her.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On or before 23 October 2013, Lilian asked the accused to provide her with a corporate account to receive her client’s monies. The explanation given by the accused as to why Lilian required a corporate account appeared to differ in his statements:</a></p><a id="p1_12"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_12-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Exhibit P12, the accused agreed that this request to provide her with a corporate account was essentially the same request as was made earlier, ie. to receive monies from the closure of her gem business, as earlier, as his personal account had been unable to receive the monies<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a>;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Exhibit P11, the accused stated that the reason was because Lilian had asked the accused whether his company was interested in a renovation project in Malaysia worth SGD500,000<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a> for a house that she had bought.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 23 October 2013, Lilian reminded the accused to provide her with the details of the corporate account.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a> As the accused did not have a corporate account, he referred Lilian to his boss, the co-accused. This was despite his suspicions as to the authenticity of Lilian’s claims.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 23 October 2013 at about 4.00 PM<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a>, the details of MCE’s OCBC account were sent, by the co-accused, to Lilian <em>via</em> Aqua Mart’s email address.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 25 October 2013, Lilian told the accused <em>via</em> SMS to withdraw SGD300,000 from the money that was going to be deposited in MCE’s OCBC account.

The reason for the delay was because OCBC required additional verification before the releasing the funds into MCE’s OCBC account. As such, the co-accused prepared a quotation for the construction project of a purported property in Malaysia. However, both the accused and co-accused were aware that there was no such project in Malaysia. The quotation was made with the sole purpose of deceiving OCBC Bank to release the monies. This quotation was sent to Lilian who signed off on it. Thereafter, a total of USD450,000 (equivalent to SGD555,277.66) was transferred into MCE’s OCBC account.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a> It should be noted that this was less than the amount that Lilian had said that was going to be deposited into the account.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Removal of stolen monies from MCE’s account</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the monies were received into MCE’s OCBC account, Lilian proceeded to ask the accused <em>via</em> SMS, on 30 October 2013, to withdraw as much money as he could.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a> The monies were supposedly meant for her business. The accused was to pass the money to an associate of Lilian in Singapore. The accused informed the co-accused of these messages. The co-accused was not happy with this turn of events as he wanted the money to roll over his businesses. However, after a discussion with the accused, the co-accused decided to withdraw SGD150,000 instead. Both of them proceeded OCBC Bank in Marine Parade to withdraw the amount and subsequently, the co-accused handed over the monies to Lilian’s associate, one Mary, in Woodlands.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereafter, the co-accused refused to hand over any further monies to Lilian. This caused some ire on Lilian’s part, and this could be seen from the tone of her subsequent SMS and e-mail messages demanding to the co-accused demanding the return of the “rest” of her monies.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this time, the co-accused had realised that the monies were tainted monies, however, he did not inform the authorities as to what had happened. Instead, the remaining money in MCE’s account was subsequently used by the co-accused to ease MCE and Aqua Mart’s cashflow problems.

The company kept 20% for “taxation and company expenses”, whilst Pantelis was given SGD3,000. It should be noted that Pantelis had earlier pleaded guilty and had been sentenced to 14 months’ imprisonment for conspiring with the offender to receive the said amount.

The Defence highlighted that the district judge in <em>Soon Beng Kim</em> found, <em>inter alia</em>, at [60], that there was insufficient evidence to show the offender’s true motive in agreeing to receive the monies and at [82], that at worst, the offender was being careless. The district judge also accepted Pantelis’s evidence that he had pleaded guilty to his charges out of convenience and at [66] of his grounds, held that there was more than a reasonable doubt that Pantelis did not have reason to believe that the USD200,000 was stolen property.</a></p><a id="p1_36"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Hergobind</em>, the offender claimed trial to six charges including two charges for dishonestly receiving stolen property under s 411 of the PC. The offender, who had martial problems at the material time, befriended one “Rose” online. He soon began an online romantic relationship with Rose. Soon, he agreed to provide her with his company’s bank account number to receive monies, ostensibly from “Rose’s” mother.

He had adequately explained why he had no reason to believe that the monies received were stolen properties, including the fact (at [79]), that he was smitten by “Rose”, and that she was open to having a relationship with him.

I note that the prosecution eventually withdrew their appeal against the district judge’s order of acquittal. The main difference between the offender in <em>Hergobind</em> and the accused was that the offender had elected to give evidence. His version of events was thus tested under cross examination. He provided an explanation as to his relationship with “Rose” and why he had agreed to provide ‘Rose” with his account number. In particular, the district judge, at [91], found the offender to be a “candid and truthful witness”.

At this point it should be noted that the reason(s) why she made this request is not clear. the accused gave different reasons in his statements (see [12], above), namely, this was either because his personal account, particulars of which he had already forwarded to Lilian earlier, had been unable to receive monies from Lilian’s client after the sale of her gem business, or for a construction / renovation project in Malaysia. Also, in his first statement, the reason given by the accused was that Lilian told him that the monies was meant as a “deposit” monies for the construction project.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a> It seems clear that there were several reasons why Lilian claimed that she needed a corporate account, yet, the accused, despite not trusting her, did not see it fit to clarify or inquire further.

Stranger still, even if we were to take the accused’s explanation at face value, and these monies was meant to be a deposit for a construction project, it should be noted that the accused had referred her request to the co-accused even before the accused was aware of the nature of the project or the value. This is bearing in mind that the accused had then been a project manager for Aqua Mart for about three years and his job scope included looking for new projects and managing existing projects, and yet, there were no details of Lilian’s plans in Malaysia.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a> The accused agreed that both he and the co-accused were aware that there was no project whatsoever in Malaysia<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> and that the corporate account was to help Lilian receive monies in Singapore.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The amount of money remitted</u>. The monies to be transferred was not determined. Lilian said that she was transferring USD500,000 but eventually transferred only USD450,000. No reason(s) were given.

Taken individually, these suspicions may not amount to the accused having “reason to believe” that the monies that Lilian intended to transfer into the corporate account were stolen monies. however, taken in totality, the facts suggested that any reasonable person, let alone an experienced project manager such as the accused, and considering the circumstances of his relationship with Lilian, would certainly have reason to more than speculate (per <em>Koh Hak Boon</em> at [12]) that the monies were stolen properties.</a></p><a id="p1_49"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a><a id="p1_50">50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I adjudged that, due to the lack of any other evidence and explanation to the contrary, that the accused had reason to believe that the moneys that were being transferred by Lilian, were stolen property.

While the accused was the one that had referred Lilian to the co-accused, and provided a conduit between the co-accused and Lilian, it was clear that the co-accused was thereafter the lead protagonist. For example, the co-accused:</a></p><a id="p1_79-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_79-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_79-p2_a-p3_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had sole control over MCE’s OCBC account;<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_79-p2_a-p3_ii">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;created the “fake” invoice that was used to deceive OCBC into releasing the withheld funds into MCE’s account;</a></p><a id="p1_79-p2_a-p3_ii"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_79-p2_a-p3_ii"></a><a id="p1_79-p2_a-p3_iii">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;determined that only SGD150,000 (and not SGD300,00) would be given to Lilian’s associate.</a></p><a id="p1_79-p2_a-p3_iii"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_79-p2_a-p3_iii"></a><a id="p1_79-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Personal benefit</u>.

It was not free. The accused would be required to repay the loan to the company. If there was any personal benefit at all, this was an indirect benefit. The accused’s actions, in all likelihood, allowed the company to stay afloat for longer than it would have had it been not for the infusion of the monies. This in turn allowed the accused to remain employed for a longer period of time.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_79-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The accused’s relationship with Lilian</u>. Earlier in these grounds, I had explained that, as the accused had chosen to remain silent, I determined his relationship based on the evidence before me ie. his statements, in particular, the answers therein. However, I am prepared to accept that what the accused had done, he did so as he wanted to gain favour or a potential romantic relationship from a female friend, notwithstanding one that he did not fully trust.</a></p><a id="p1_79-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_80">80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was therefore of the view that a downward adjustment to the indicative starting sentence would be appropriate in the present case.

The final sentence I had reached is in line with the sentences imposed in cases with a more or less similar factual matrix and is proportionate to the amount of stolen monies received. This sentence also reflected the appropriate culpability of the accused <em>vis-à-vis</em> the co-accused. The co-accused, Tan Cheng Hock was sentenced to 40 months imprisonment, being more culpable, and had benefited the most personally (ie. about SGD400,000) from the monies received.</a></p><a id="p1_82"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Final Sentence Imposed</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a><a id="p1_83">83&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, I imposed a sentence of <b><em><u>25 months’ imprisonment</u></em></b> on the accused, Alfonso Low, for his role in this matter.
