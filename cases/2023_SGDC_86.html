The plaintiff was engaged by the defendants, who were the property owners, to provide interior design and renovation services for their property. Prior to the commencement of renovation works by the plaintiff, the defendants’ property was brand new as it was purchased directly from the developer of D’Leedon.</a></p><a id="p1_1"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of trial, I awarded judgment in favour of the plaintiff in the sum of $60,000 with the usual statutory interest from date of writ to judgment. As for the defendants’ counterclaim, I awarded the sum of $10,028 in favour of the defendants with the usual statutory interest from date of writ to judgment.</a></p><a id="p1_2"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being dissatisfied, the defendants have since appealed against the decision. These are the full grounds of my decision.</a></p><a id="p1_3"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the legal completion went through for the purchase of the property, the defendants wanted the property to be renovated as a home for their family which included the defendants’ children. The plaintiff was engaged as the party responsible for the renovation and parties signed a renovation contract in the form of a Quotation.</a></p><a id="p1_4"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was undisputed that the plaintiff’s Quotation (Quotation No Q/HS/2018829/MT) dated 22 October 2018, which was in the Chinese language, formed the written contract between parties. It was also undisputed that this Quotation was for the sum of $150,000 and the defendants had paid prior to the commencement of the present suit, the sum of $90,000, leaving an outstanding balance of $60,000. In addition, the plaintiff also claimed $11,609.50 for Variation Works which was disputed. The plaintiff clarified that the sum of $11,609.50 was claimed as Variation Works in [28] of its Closing Submissions. In short, the plaintiff was claiming a total sum of $71,609.50 for all works done.</a></p><a id="p1_5"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also undisputed that the contract provided for the completion of works by 28 December 2018, liquidated damages at the sum of $500 per day and a 1 year guarantee for all labour and installation.</a></p><a id="p1_6"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, throughout the renovation period and until the present suit was filed, the defendants were dissatisfied with the works performed by the plaintiff and they were also unhappy with the alleged delay in completion of the works. As a result, they refused to pay the balance outstanding sum of $60,000, denied the payment of Variation Works and counterclaimed the costs of rectification (to be quantified), liquidated damages for 44 days from 28 December 2018 to 22 March 2019 amounting to $42,500 and costs of alternative living arrangements due to the alleged delay in completion of the works. In addition, the defendants were also claiming for cost of tiles which they had procured in the sum of $2,568 as these were tiles needed to cover the flooring after cabinetry was moved.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it became apparent to the plaintiff that the defendants continued to be unhappy with the plaintiff’s work and declined to take possession of the property, the plaintiff proceeded to leave the keys to the property in the mailbox of the property on 21 March 2019.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ cases</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s version</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff’s pleaded case was straightforward. Their position was that they had substantially performed the works stated in the Quotation by the contracted date of 28 December 2018. In addition, the plaintiff claimed that they had also completed the Variation Works which were verbally requested by the defendants latest by 20 March 2019. Therefore, they were entitled to be paid as claimed.</a></p><a id="p1_9"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendants’ version</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At [5] of the Defence and Counterclaim, the defendants denied the claim on the basis that the works were not substantially completed by 28 December 2018 and the plaintiff failed to carry out the works with reasonable care and skill as particularised in a to q of [5].</a></p><a id="p1_10"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good summary of the areas of disputes between parties could be found in the 3 Scott Schedules which were referred to in the course of the trial. The Scott Schedule for the Quotation which formed the main contract had been marked as P1, the Scott Schedule for Variation Works had been marked as P2 and finally, the Scott Schedule for the Rectification works had been marked as P3. P1 and P2 were renovation items that were claimed by the plaintiff and P3 contained the renovation items that formed the subject matter of the defendants’ counterclaim.</a></p><a id="p1_11"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By consent of parties, this court conducted a hot-tubbing of 4 experts as the court and the parties deemed this method as the most productive and conducive one in adducing evidence on the issue of disputed works and the issue of alleged existence of formaldehyde emanating from the furniture in the child’s room.</a></p><a id="p1_12"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues to be determined </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues for determination were:</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="">First issue - Were the defendants liable to pay plaintiff the sum of $60,000 as the outstanding sum under the Quotation?</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a><a id="">Second issue - Were the defendants liable to pay the plaintiff the sum of $11,609.50 for the Variation Works?</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a><a id="">Third issue - Was the plaintiff liable for the defendants’ counterclaim?</a></p><a id=""> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision of the court</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">First issue- Were the defendants liable to pay plaintiff the sum of $60,000 as the outstanding sum under the Quotation? </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law on what is practical and substantial completion of construction is trite. In <em>Smile Inc Dental Surgeons Pte Ltd v OP3 International Pte Ltd</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20854-SSP.xml')">[2017] SGHC 246</a>, Chan Seng Onn J (as he then was) at [31] and [32] of his judgment, Chan J determined the date of practical completion to be 31 October 2013 although it was undisputed that as at the date of practical completion, there were still 36 incomplete and outstanding items of works. In <em>Law and Practice of Construction Contracts, 5<sup>th</sup> Edition, Volume 1</em> at [9.069] to [9.071], eminent author on construction law, Mr Chow Kok Fong, opined that when date of completion is challenged, the court may inquire whether the works have reached a state of readiness for use or occupation by the owner with the exception of trivial omissions or defects.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying the law to the facts of the present suit, I found that there was practical or substantial completion on 28 December 2018 which was the date provided under the contract in that the defendants could occupy the property although there were trivial defects existing. Also, the rectification works performed after 28 December 2018 did not require the defendants to cease or stop them from occupation of the property. There were photographs of the property exhibited and these were taken on 27 December 2018<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a>. In these photographs, ladders were seen to be still in place and protective works were present. After a careful review of this evidence, I decided to accept the plaintiff’s explanation as stated in [53] of its Closing Submissions that presence of ladders and protective works did not mean there was no substantial completion on 28 December 2018. Ladders and protective works were present as the defendants had made verbal requests for additional works outside of the Quotation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both parties called experts to give evidence relating to the alleged incomplete and defective works. These were the plaintiff’s Chartered Building Surveyor Mr Chin Cheong (“Mr Chin”) and the defendants’ Quantity Surveyor Mr Jerome Chung (“Mr Chung”). At the hot-tubbing of both experts, it was established that most of the items in P1 which contained list of items covered in the Quotation were actually not disputed in that the items were installed on site as per the Quotation.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that the Quotation which was drafted in the Chinese Language as requested by the defendants did provide for certain items to be “fire proof” and these had been listed in P1 as items 6, 12, 13, 15, 17, 22 and 23. However, this court was guided by the evidence of both experts who agreed that such items cannot be fire proof. Mr Chin testified that such items were not fire-resistant and had been classified as non-flammable by the Singapore Civil Defence Force. Mr Chin testified that even metals such as gold and silver did have a melting point so cabinetry, furniture and finishing would likewise not be fire-proof. Even Mr Chung agreed with Mr Chin’s evidence.</a></p><a id="p1_17"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this renovation project, the main plaintiff’s employee dealing with the defendants was Principal Designer Ms Marilyn Tan (“Ms Tan”) and the key person dealing with the plaintiff was the first defendant. The testimony of Ms Tan and her assistant, Ms Yeong Mei Yan, was that the plaintiff in the preparation of the Quotation had used online refence materials to facilitate translation from English to Mandarin for term used as “fire proof” in the contract. Therefore, there could have been mistranslation in the process. I accepted the plaintiff’s explanation. Ms Tan also testified that the plaintiff had explained that the materials used were not fire proof to the first defendant prior to manufacturing of such items and after the Quotation was accepted by the defendants. Therefore, the defendants were aware and accepted that the materials used were not fire-proof. Yet, they chose to proceed with the renovation contract instead of taking action to have the contract rescinded.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the permises, I awarded the plaintiff its claim for the sum of $60,000 with the usual statutory interest from date of writ to judgment.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Second issue- Were the defendants liable to pay the plaintiff the sum of $11,609.50 for the Variation Works? </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At [11] of Ms Tan’s AEIC<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a>, her evidence was that the contract was followed by a further renovation contract dated 14 November 2018 which contained detailed terms and conditions. Under this further contract, it was provided that any Variation orders must be signed by all parties<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. Therefore, the plaintiff’s own evidence was that Variation orders must be signed by all parties.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was undisputed that no Variation orders were signed by all parties. The plaintiff’s explanation was that the first defendant’s requests were often conveyed verbally during site inspections or at client meetings and as such, these requests were “rushed”. I found that since parties met up on a number of occasions, there were ample opportunities for Variation orders to be prepared and signed. Therefore, I found that such Variation Works were actually done by Ms Tan on a goodwill basis in an attempt to appease the first defendant in order to convince the defendants to pay the plaintiff the balance of $60,000 outstanding under the Quotation.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this basis, I decided to dismiss the plaintiff’s claim for Variation Works as listed in P2.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Third issue- Was the plaintiff liable for the defendants’ counterclaim?</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the defendants, as the property was incapable of occupation even after the 28 December 2018, they had to continue staying at alternative accommodation at Regency House at 121 Penang Road, Singapore. They claimed the cost of such accommodation for the period of 28 December 2018 to 22 March 2019 for the sum of $ 42,500<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a>. Having found that the property was capable of owners’ occupation as practical or substantial occupation was attained on 28 December 2018, it followed that there was no basis for the defendants’ claim for the alternative housing. Therefore, I dismissed the defendants’ claim for this item.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendants exhibited a photograph of an electrical socket<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a> above the kitchen sink in the open concept kitchen which the plaintiff had failed to remove as part of the renovation works. Ms Tan conceded at trial that it was their negligence and should be removed as leaving it at the open concept sink area posed as a safety hazard. In the premises, I awarded the cost of the removal of the electrical socket in the sum of $210 as I agreed with the plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at [261] that this rectification cost was reasonable.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I had found that the contract was practically or substantially performed by 28 December 2018, there were minor rectifications required as counterclaimed by the defendants.

Although both air quality experts testified that the reading of 0.96ppm was above the standard of 0.08ppm, both agreed that such standard was only a guideline and such tests had been conducted correctly on “occupied space” and not on individual furniture. Both experts also agreed that the most common way of resolving such concerns was to air the room by opening windows.
