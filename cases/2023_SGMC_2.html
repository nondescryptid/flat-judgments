The application was “registered” (in the State Courts’ system on 21 November 2022 – with the provisional registration number – “CM-913288-2022”) as a “Complaint to a Magistrate” against the said four officers of the SPF – namely: Mr Christopher Koh; Mr Chew Wee Chieh; Mr Jonathan Yee; and Mr Wong Ken Jon (“the four Police Officers”). The said “Complaint to a Magistrate” was filed pursuant to s 151(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (“the CPC”). She (Ms Iris Koh) was formally “examined” on oath on the contents of the said “Complaint to a Magistrate” (together with her “Grounds of Complaint”) before me on 23 November 2022 (“the Magistrate’s Complaint”). (The Magistrate’s Complaint was then assigned the Magistrate’s Complaint Case Number MAG-901378-2022.)</a></p><a id="p1_1"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Iris Koh’s principal contentions in the Magistrate’s Complaint were the following. The four Police Officers had breached the Protocol – that had been laid out by the Attorney-General’s Chambers (“the AGC”) – regarding the “Legal Professional Privilege Review Protocol”. The Protocol was essentially that the exhibits that had been seized from her – namely her MacBook Laptop, her Vivo Mobile Phone and the Original Cloud Email Disk (containing her emails) – would be sealed in “Tamper-proof bags” and returned to the “Legal Professional Privilege IO” after the verification of the data was completed. This step was not carried out during her last “Legal Professional Privilege Review”. She believed that this then resulted in the “chain of custody of evidence” (that had been seized during her arrest) being compromised and that the said evidence would no longer be admissible in Court (during her trial in the State Courts). She was also concerned that the Members of the Police Forensic Team (namely the four Police Officers) were not forthcoming / kept silent / were misleading her with their reticence and had remained silent when she had asked one Mr Sivakumar (a member of the AGC Team) on Friday 4 November 2022 if the extraction of the “Golden Copies” (which is an “exact duplicate”) of her said MacBook Laptop, her Vivo Mobile Phone and the Original Cloud Email Disk (“her three electronic devices”) were ready to be “signed off” and the said Mr Sivakumar had stated that they were not ready (and that it could be done on Monday 7 November 2022 when her counsel would be present). She was extremely shocked on Monday 7 November 2022 when she was provided the said “Golden Copies” (of her three electronic devices) and the person who had “signed off” on them, Mr Christopher Koh (one of the four Police Officers), was on medical leave. She then realised that her three electronic devices were not sealed in “Tamper-proof bags” – in accordance with the Protocol – but in envelopes. She added that she was worried that “fraudulent evidence” could be planted in her devices – “<em>as with crimes on [sic] global scale to set up whistle blowers</em>” and that she has been “<em>speaking up about the Covid-19 Vaccination Programme and worldwide there has been exposure of fraud and malpractices by the authorities</em>”.</a></p><a id="p1_2"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Iris Koh accordingly applied – in the Magistrate’s Complaint – that the Police be directed to investigate the said breach (set out at [2] above) of the said Protocol by the four Police Officers. Her position was that, having regard to her contentions (set out at [2] above), the four Police Officers had committed offences contrary to s 182 and/or s 187(1) of the Penal Code 1871 (“the Penal Code”). (She had also made a passing reference to s 204A of the Penal Code but did not pursue it.)</a></p><a id="p1_3"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was of the view, at the conclusion of the proceedings, that Ms Iris Koh had not provided any credible evidence in support of the constituent elements of the offences – namely ss 182 and 187(1) of the Penal Code – that she alleged had been committed by the four Police Officers (or at least one of them). I found that there was “<em>insufficient reason to proceed</em>” – within the ambit of s 152(1) of the CPC – and accordingly dismissed the Magistrate’s Complaint.</a></p><a id="p1_4"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary of the Appellant’s Position </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Iris Koh confirmed – during the “examination” on oath before me – that everything she had stated in the “Complaint to a Magistrate” (together with her “Grounds of Complaint”) and the Police Report (No. A/20221118/7018 – made on 18 November 2022 at 12.22 pm that she submitted) were true and correct. She specifically reconfirmed before me (including in her responses to questions) that:</a></p><a id="p1_5"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there was a breach of the Protocol (laid out by the AGC) regarding the “Legal Professional Privilege Review Protocol” – namely that her three electronic devices (that had been seized from her) would be sealed in “Tamper-proof bags” and returned to the “Legal Professional Privilege IO” after the verification of the data was completed – and this step was not done during the last “Legal Professional Privilege Review”;</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she believed that the “chain of custody of evidence” collected during her arrest had, as a result of the said step not being done, been compromised and that the evidence was no longer admissible in Court (during her trial in the State Courts);</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she was concerned that the four Police Officers (as members of the Forensic Team) were not forthcoming or kept silent or were misleading her with their reticence – and this occurred when she had asked the said Mr Sivakumar (of the AGC Team) on Friday 4 November 2022 if the “Golden Copies” of her devices were ready to be “signed off” and he (Mr Sivakumar) had then stated that they were not ready and that it could be done on Monday 7 November 2022 – and the Forensic Team had remained silent;</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she was extremely shocked on Monday 7 November 2022 when she was provided the said “Golden Copies” and the officer who had “signed off” on them – Mr Christopher Koh (one of the four Police Officers) – was absent (on the ground that he was on medical leave);</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_d"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_e">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the “Protocol Room” (at the Police Cantonment Complex where the three electronic devices were kept) was sealed each time she left the said room and she wondered how the said “Golden Copies” came about; and</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_e"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_e"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_f">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she also realised on Monday 7 November 2022 that her three electronic devices were not in “Tamper-proof bags” and “sealed” with her signature (in accordance with the Protocol) but were in envelopes and she was concerned that “fraudulent evidence” could be planted in her devices.</a></p><a id="p1_5-p2_f"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5-p2_f"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Iris Koh also reconfirmed (pursuant to my query) that the purpose of her filing the Magistrate's Complaint was for a direction that an investigation be carried out by the relevant authority on the said breach of the Protocol (regarding the “Legal Professional Privilege Review Protocol”) with respect to her three electronic devices. She then reiterated the following. She had on Friday 4 November 2022 asked (in the room) in front of Mr Sivakumar if the “Golden Copies” were ready and he (Mr Sivakumar) had stated that they were not. The Forensic Team was there. They should have said so if the “Golden Copies” were ready.</a></p><a id="p1_6"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Iris Koh clarified that her contention that the “chain of custody of evidence” collected during her arrest had been compromised (due to the breach of the said Protocol and her believe that the evidence was no longer admissible in Court) had not been raised by her counsel during the Pre-Trial Conference(s) (held in connection with charges that she was claiming trial to in the State Courts). (She added that there was discussion during the Pre-Trial Conference on how the Forensic Team was to extract information from her devices and provide it to the Investigation Team.)</a></p><a id="p1_7"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked Ms Iris Koh what the specific offence was that she was alleging (in the Magistrate's Complaint) as having been committed by the four Police Officers. This was after: the Magistrate's Complaint framework was explained to her (that it is essentially limited to criminal offences allegedly committed by the Respondents); and she was informed that the breach of the said Protocol (set out at [5] above) would not constitute an offence. She then stated that the offences were under s 182 and s 187(1) of the Penal Code.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Iris Koh then confirmed that her contention was that an offence under s 182 and/or s 187(1) of the Penal Code is committed where the allegation is that a public servant or public servants – and in this instance the four Police Officers (of the Forensic Team) – had not assisted another public servant – and in this instance Mr Sivakumar (of the AGC Team).</a></p><a id="p1_9"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reviewed the scope and constituent elements of ss 182 and 187(1) of the Penal Code. I then stated to Ms Iris Koh that I could not agree with her contentions that the said two sections were applicable and that an offence is committed under the said sections in the fact situation (including alleged omissions) that she had set out in the Magistrate’s Complaint (including in her Grounds of Complaint, her said Police Report and her clarifications to questions before me). I informed her that:</a></p><a id="p1_10"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_10-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her allegations (as set out at [5] above) – including the points that the four Police Officers had breached the terms of the Protocol (that her three electronic devices would be sealed in “Tamper-proof bags” and returned to the “Legal Professional Privilege IO” after the verification of the data was completed) – and hence her belief that the “chain of custody of evidence” seized during her arrest was compromised and no longer admissible in Court – are matters that are directly connected to and within the sole purview of the Trial Court – and ought to be raised by her/her counsel at the Pre-trial Conference(s) for directions – and to be dealt with by the Trial Judge at the trial; and</a></p><a id="p1_10-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_10-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her related contentions (as set out also at [5]) above – including the points: that the four Police Officers may have “misled” her by their “silence” (following Mr Sivakumar’s response to her question on Friday 4 November 2022 on whether the “Golden Copies” were ready); her “shock” when she was provided (on Monday 7 November 2022) the said “Golden Copies” and Mr Christopher Koh (who had “signed off” on them) was absent/on medical leave; her concern as to how the said “Golden Copies” came about - since her three electronic devices were kept in a sealed room; that her three electronic devices were not in “Tamper-proof bags” and “sealed” with her signature (in accordance with the Protocol) but were in envelopes; and her further concern that “fraudulent evidence” could be planted in her devices – were centred on the same issues and ought to be also raised by her/her counsel at the Pre-trial Conference(s) for directions – and to be dealt with by the Trial Judge at the trial.</a></p><a id="p1_10-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Iris Koh then contended that ss 182 and 187(1) of the Penal Code should be applicable as there was “fraudulent representation” and as she wanted to know how the “Golden Copies” appeared. She also stated that she did not agree that s 182 or s 187(1) of the Penal Code does not “create” an offence when public servants (the four Police Officers in this fact situation) do not assist or volunteer information to another public servant (Mr Sivakumar in this fact situation) in the course of a discussion or meeting they are all at. She then further contended that s 182 of the Penal Code was applicable as there was “omission of information” and reiterated the following. Mr Sivakumar had on Friday 4 November 2022 stated, when she had asked him whether the “Golden Copies” were ready, that they were not. They then left the room and it was sealed with the “State Seal” with her signature. She understood that the “Golden Copies” were being processed in the sealed room during the weekend. The “Golden Copies” were provided to her on Monday 7 November 2022 and she was told that Mr Christopher Koh had “signed off” and he was on medical leave. She had also discovered on Monday 7 November 2022 that her three electronic devices were not in “Tamper-proof bags” and she wished to know “what happened” between Friday 4 November 2022 and Monday 7 November 2022. Her position was therefore that the “offence” was – how did the “Golden Copies” come about from a sealed room and that Mr Christopher Koh had either lied or misled her (on Friday 4 November 2022) into thinking that the “Golden Copies” were not ready.</a></p><a id="p1_11"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reiterated to Ms Iris Koh that – as the substance of her contentions was that one or more of the four Police Officers had lied to her on Friday 4 November 2022 that the “Golden Copies” were not ready and the “Golden Copies” were provided to her on Monday 7 November 2022 – neither s 182 nor s 187(1) of the Penal Code was applicable in the fact situation that she presented. Her response to this was that somebody lied to her and that is an offence.</a></p><a id="p1_12"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also informed Ms Iris Koh that she was at liberty – with respect to her concerns or allegations regarding the possible misconduct of one or more of the four Police Officers – to lodge a complaint with the relevant department of the SPF or raise the matter with the AGC.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="">&nbsp;</a></p><a id=""> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Framework of Magistrate’s Complaints / Applicable Law / Assessment of Appellant’s Contentions/Fact Situation</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Framework of Magistrate’s Complaints</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 151(1) of the CPC provides that any “person may make a complaint to a Magistrate”. The term “complaint” is defined in s 2 of the CPC to mean: “… any allegation made orally or in writing to a Magistrate with a view to the Magistrate taking action under this Code that some person, whether known or unknown, has committed or is guilty of an offence”. The Magistrate is required, under s 151(2)(a) of the CPC, to examine the Complainant on oath and reduce the substance of the examination to writing. The Magistrate may then, under s 151(2)(b) of the CPC (among other orders), direct any Police Officer to make inquiries to determine the truth or falsehood of the person’s Complaint and to report the result of the investigations to the Magistrate. The Magistrate may, under s 152(1) of the CPC, after having examined the Complainant and following an inquiry, dismiss the Complaint if he/she decides that “there is insufficient reason to proceed”. This phrase – “insufficient reason to proceed” – is not defined in the CPC.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There does not appear to be a Singapore High Court decision on the ambit of s 152(1) of the CPC. Section 152 of the CPC is similar to s 203 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 of India. Justice Mirza Hameedullah Beg, in the Supreme Court of India, in <em>Debendra Nath Bhattacharjee &amp; Ors v State Of West Bengal &amp; Another</em>, AIR 1972 SC 1607, stated among other things at [6] and [7], the following:</a></p><a id="p1_15"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;…we think that the Presidency Magistrate had not correctly understood the scope and purpose of the power to dismiss a complaint under Section 203 Criminal Procedure Code.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has to be remembered that an order of dismissal of a complaint under Section 203 Criminal Procedure Code has to be made on judicially sound grounds……. If, however, a bare perusal of a complaint or the evidence led in support of it show that essential ingredients of the offences alleged are absent or that the dispute is only of a civil nature or that there are such patent absurdities in evidence produced that it would be a waste of time to proceed further, the complaint could be properly dismissed under Section 203 Criminal Procedure Code.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position, based on the Indian Supreme Court’s decision (referred to at [15] above) and subject to guidance of the Singapore High Court, would be that a Magistrate’s Complaint may be dismissed under s 152(1) of the CPC on the ground that there is “insufficient reason to proceed” where, among other things, the essential ingredients/constituent elements of the offences - that are alleged by the Complainant as having been committed by the Respondent(s) - are absent.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sections 182 and 187(1) of the Penal Code</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 182 of the Penal Code (without the Illustrations) is set out below for ease of reference:</a></p><a id="p1_17"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>False information, with intent to cause a public servant to use his lawful power to the injury of another person</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">182.

(Section 182 of the Penal Code [Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed] was amended – by s 54 of the Criminal Law Reform Act 2019 – with effect from 1 January 2020 – by the deletion of the words “one year, or with fine which may extend to $5,000” and the substitution with the words “2 years, or with fine”. The current version of s 182 of the Penal Code is otherwise substantially the same as that considered by the High Court in the <em>Chua Wen Hao</em>. Menon CJ stated the following in <em>Chua Wen Hao</em> at [19] and [20] on the constituent elements of s 182 of the Penal Code:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;…To restate the elements of the s 182 offence…the Prosecution must show that: (a) the accused person gave information to a public servant; (b) such information was false; (c) the accused person knew or believed that such information was false; and (d) the accused person intended thereby to cause, or knew it to be likely that he or she would thereby cause, the public servant to: (i) use his or her lawful powers to the injury or annoyance of another person; or (ii) do something which he or she ought not to do if the true state of facts were known to him or her; or (iii) omit to do something which he or she ought not to omit if the true state of facts were known to him or her.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having regard to the three alternative scenarios in which the fourth limb of s 182 may be satisfied, it is evident that s 182 is not concerned with simply any false statement made to a public servant, nor with simply any effect caused by a false statement made to a public servant. Rather, it is concerned with the situation where a public servant abuses, misuses or improperly withholds the use of his or her lawful powers as a result of a false statement made to him or her. It is helpful here to note what is meant by “lawful powers”. In my judgment, that means powers that are conferred by the law and to be exercised in conformity with the purposes of the law. In this light, what brings a fact situation within the ambit of s 182 is the abuse, misuse or improper withholding of the use of these powers, meaning their deployment or the withholding of their deployment otherwise than for the purposes for which they have been conferred. It follows that the making of a false statement or the furnishing of false information is a necessary but insufficient predicate to constitute the offence under s 182. At the core of this offence lies the exercise by a public servant of lawful powers that ought not to have been exercised, or (as the case may be) the omission by a public servant to exercise lawful powers that ought to have been exercised, if the false information had not been provided to him or her. There is a normative element in this because s 182 is designed to safeguard members of the public from the improper exercise of lawful powers by a public servant, or (as the case may be) the improper omission by a public servant to exercise such powers, as a result of false information provided to him or her, rather than to protect a public servant from the inefficient exercise of his or her lawful powers…</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 187 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) was repealed and re-enacted – by s 55 of the Criminal Law Reform Act 2019 – with effect from 1 January 2020.

Paragraph (g) of s 21(1) of the Code refers to every officer of the Government (and other named entities) whose duty, among others, is: maintaining law and order; preserving the public peace; preventing and detecting offences; and apprehending offenders or otherwise bringing offenders to justice. The four Police Officers (named as the Respondents in the Magistrate’s Complaint) would, on the basis of the functions set out in s 4 of the Police Force Act 2004 and the descriptions set out in paragraph (g) of s 21(1) of the Penal Code, be “public servants”. Mr Sivakumar (of the AGC Team), on the premise that he is a Legal Service Officer in the Singapore Legal Service, would be within the description – “… and every officer in the service or pay of Government, or remunerated ….. for the performance of any public duty” – as set out in paragraph (h) of s 21(1) of the Penal Code.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 43 of the Penal Code provides, among other things, that a person is said to be “legally bound to do” whatever it is illegal or unlawful in him to omit.

There was no credible or any other evidence that one or all of the four Police Officers had “deliberately” omitted to provide Mr Sivakumar any assistance that he had sought from any of them or that the said assistance was with respect to the “execution” of his (Mr Sivakumar’s) “public duty”. She did not also provide any credible evidence on the constituent elements of a possible offence under s 182 or s 187(1) of the Penal Code with regard to her other contentions set out at [23] above.</a></p><a id="p1_26"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Section 204A of the Penal Code</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Iris Koh had made passing reference to s 204A of the Penal Code and I pointed out the following to her:</a></p><a id="p1_27"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27"></a><a id="p1_27-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s 204A that deals with, among other things, perversion of the course of justice, is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years or with fine or with both;</a></p><a id="p1_27-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_27-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an offence under s 204A is, under the First Schedule of the CPC, triable by a District Court and not a Magistrate's Court;</a></p><a id="p1_27-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_27-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a Magistrate's Complaint may be filed only with respect to offences for which the maximum term of imprisonment provided by law does not exceed three years or which is a fine-only offence; and</a></p><a id="p1_27-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_27-p2_d">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Magistrate dealing with a Magistrate's Complaint does not therefore have the jurisdiction to deal with a Complaint where the offence alleged in the Complaint is one under s 204A of the Penal Code.</a></p><a id="p1_27-p2_d"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Public Prosecutor’s Consent for Prosecution of Offences under Sections 182 and 187 of the Penal Code; and Whether an “order” under Section 152(1) of the CPC may be the subject matter of an Appeal to the High Court</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27-p2_d"></a><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should, for completeness, touch on two ancillary points.

Having regard to my finding – at the conclusion of the first step – that the said contentions/fact situation did not support the constituent elements of an offence under s 182 or s 187(1) of the Penal Code (and hence there was “insufficient reason to proceed”) – I did not think that it was necessary to proceed to the second step. (The second step being the requirement – at a later stage of the proceedings – for the Public Prosecutor’s Consent if the matter was further prosecuted for the same offences.)</a></p><a id="p1_30"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Appeal on an Order of Dismissal</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of whether an “order” made under s 152(1) of the CPC – dismissing a Magistrate’s Complaint (on the ground that there is “insufficient reason to proceed”) – would qualify for a right of appeal to the General Division of the High Court – does not appear to have been decided directly by the Singapore High Court. Section 374(1) of the CPC provides, among other things, that an appeal against any judgment, sentence or order of a Court may only be made as provided for by the CPC or by any other written law. There is no specific provision in the CPC or other written law that permits an appeal against an “order” made under s 152(1) of the CPC (dismissing a Magistrate’s Complaint). The words “judgment”, “sentence” and “order” are not defined in the CPC or the Interpretation Act 1965 or the Criminal Law Reform Act 2019. The other applicable subsections of s 374 of the CPC (and s 377 of the CPC that deals with the procedure for appeals) do not refer to or deal with an appeal against an “order” made under s 152(1) of the CPC.</a></p><a id="p1_31"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chao Hick Tin JA (as he then was) in <em>Soh Guan Cheow Anthony v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0238.xml')">[2014] SGHC 238</a> (“<em>Anthony Soh</em>”) examined whether the word “order” in the phrase “judgment, sentence or order” in s 395(2)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) should be construed to refer only to “final orders” or whether it was broad enough to also encompass “interlocutory orders” made in the course of a criminal trial (at the State Courts). Chao JA stated at [29]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…., there is a presumption in statutory construction that similar words in the same statute should be given the same meaning. To this end, the phrase “judgment, sentence or order” is also found in provisions of the CPC which deal with appeals (<em>eg</em>, s 374 of the CPC). It is trite that the appeal provisions apply only to judgments, sentences and orders which have an element of finality in them. This therefore gives rise to a presumption that the word “order” in s 395(2)(b) must relate to a final order (“the Presumption”). This Presumption is also supported by the <em>ejusdem generis</em> rule since the words “judgment” and “sentence” preceding the word “order” relate to decisions which have an element of finality. By way of example, following the passing of a <em>judgment</em> of guilt against an accused, the court may impose a <em>sentence</em> (<em>eg</em>, a term of imprisonment or a fine) as well as in appropriate cases, make a further <em>order</em> (<em>eg</em>, a disqualification or confiscation order).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions that Chao JA had reviewed and decided on in Anthony Soh – namely ss 374 and 395(2)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) – are the same provisions as ss 374 and 395(2)(b) of the CPC. Yong Pung How CJ had in <em>Knight Glenn Jeyasingam v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1998] 3 SLR(R) 0196.xml')">[1998] 3 SLR(R) 196</a> stated at [14] the following:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">There was no question that this appeal arose out of a criminal case or matter. The concern was with whether the district judge’s order was appealable on the basis that it was not a final order. Although not expressly stipulated by statute, case law has yielded the overriding requirement of finality in the judgment, sentence or order appealed against to qualify for a right of appeal. The court in <em>Maleb bin Su v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/MLJ/39183-M.xml')">[1984] 1 MLJ 311</a> applied the <em>ejusdem generis</em> rule in interpreting s 307(i) CPC (in <em>pari materia</em> to our s 247(1) CPC) and held, at 312B of the judgment:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">The order must therefore be a final order in the sense that it is final in effect as in the case of a judgment or a sentence.

It would appear that an “order” made under s 152(1) of the CPC may not qualify for a right of appeal under s 374(1) of the CPC unless such an “order” is considered (by the Appellate Court) as being a “final order” and the other requirements of s 374 of the CPC are also satisfied.</a></p><a id="p1_34"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 400(1) of the CPC provides, among other things, that the General Division of the High Court may, on its own motion or on the application of a State Court, the Public Prosecutor or the accused in any proceedings, call for and examine the record of any criminal proceeding before any State Court to satisfy itself, among other issues, the correctness or legality or propriety of any judgment, sentence or order recorded or passed and as to the regularity of those proceedings. Section 401(1) of the CPC provides, among other matters, that the General Division of the High Court may, on examining a record under revision, direct the lower court to make further inquiry into a Complaint which has been dismissed under s 152 of the CPC. The specific incorporation in s 401(1) of the CPC to the High Court’s said power in a Criminal Revision (to direct further inquiry into a Complaint which has been dismissed by the lower court) may fortify the argument that such a dismissal would not qualify for a right of appeal to the High Court</a></p><a id="p1_35"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is however no reference in s 400(1) of the CPC to a Complainant – such as the Appellant – having a right to apply to the High Court for a review of the decision. It would, having regard to this, appear that a Complainant whose Complaint to a Magistrate has been dismissed under s 152(1) of the CPC – as in this case – and who wishes to pursue the matter – may need to seek the consideration of the Public Prosecutor on whether the Public Prosecutor would be prepared to apply – under s 400(1) of the CPC – to the General Division of the High Court for a possible revision of the decision.</a></p><a id="p1_36"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was satisfied and accordingly found, for the reasons set out above (at [23] to [26]), that Ms Iris Koh did not in the Magistrate's Complaint (and the related documents and in her responses during the examination on oath) provide any credible evidence of the constituent elements of an offence contrary to either s 182 or s 187(1) of the Penal Code that she had alleged as having been committed by one or more or all of the four Police Officers – and hence there was “insufficient reason to proceed” on the Magistrate's Complaint. I accordingly dismissed the Magistrate’s Complaint in accordance with s 152(1) of the CPC. She, being dissatisfied with the dismissal of the Magistrate’s Complaint, has filed the appeal against the decision.</a></p><a id="p1_37"> </a></div></content></html>
