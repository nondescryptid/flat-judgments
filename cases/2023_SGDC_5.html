The Accused contacted Praveen to tell him not to contact his girlfriend. The Accused and Praveen communicated through phone calls with each other and there were some verbal disputes in the following weeks due to jealousy over the Accused’s girlfriend and other personal issues. Sometime in late March 2022, Praveen and the Accused again argued with each other during a phone call. The Accused planned an attack against Praveen.</a></p><a id="p1_11"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Facts Pertaining to DAC 905563/2022</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 5 April 2022, sometime at night, the Accused met Niswan for dinner. After dinner, both were relaxing at a void deck of a Woodlands block. The Accused told Niswan that he wanted to carry out an attack on Praveen in Boon Lay. The Accused told Niswan that he knew Praveen would be in the vicinity of Boon Lay Drive on 6 April 2022 as Praveen will be attending wedding celebrations of a mutual friend Emmanuel s/o Ravi (“Emmanuel”, who is the groom of the wedding) who resides in Boon Lay. Niswan agreed to join the Accused in this attack. On 5 April 2022, the Accused and Niswan purchased two bread knives to use in the attack the following day. The Accused brought back the knives to his house and kept them. The knives’ blades are about 23.5cm long.</a></p><a id="p1_12"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 6 April 2022, the Accused and Niswan met up in the morning to plan the attack. They drank some beer. They then retrieved the knives from the Accused’s house and concealed the knives underneath the waistband of their pants. On 6 April 2022, at about 3.45pm, the Accused and Niswan arrived at Block 175, Boon Lay Drive, Singapore and waited for Praveen to arrive at the vicinity. They consumed another can of beer and tracked Praveen’s movements through Praveen’s social media posts. The Accused and Niswan were each armed with a bread knife. At about 4.50pm, they spotted Praveen and Saran exiting a vehicle in the carpark vicinity of Block 175, Boon Lay Drive, Singapore. Praveen’s multiple friends (including females) also alighted from the vehicle. They had just returned from the wedding celebrations and they intended to continue the wedding celebrations at Emmanuel’s block.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At about 5.03pm, at the vicinity of the said carpark, the Accused and Niswan immediately ran towards Praveen. The Accused swung the knife towards Praveen’s head but Praveen blocked the attack with his hands. The Accused slashed Praveen’s hand. Niswan also slashed Praveen’s hand. Saran, who was nearby, shouted at both of them to stop attacking Praveen. The Accused and Niswan then turned their attention to Saran. The Accused was nearer to Saran, and he slashed Saran on his head<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a>. Praveen attempted to flee as he was slashed. The Accused and Niswan chased him and this time, both slashed Praveen on the upper torso and hands outside the coffeeshop of Block 175.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Praveen again attempted to flee and managed to reach a walkway near the main road of Block 175. The Accused caught up with Praveen and kicked him which resulted in Praveen falling down. The Accused and Niswan slashed Praveen’s head and torso again. While Praveen was on the ground, they also kicked him multiple times. In total, there were three separate locations in the vicinity of Block 175, Boon Lay Drive, Singapore that Praveen was attacked by the two of them resulting in multiple slash wounds. The attack took place near the carpark, outside a coffeeshop area and also a walkway near a main road. Both of them had aimed their weapons at Praveen’s head and body during the slashing.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After they ended their attack on Praveen, the Accused and Niswan saw Emmanuel in the said carpark vicinity. Emmanuel was shocked and asked them why they had to do this on his wedding day and ruin the wedding. At about 5.10pm, Niswan then pointed his knife at Emmanuel in a threatening manner and wanted to slash him. Emmanuel felt alarmed and feared for his life. The Accused pulled Niswan back as he did not have any prior dispute with Emmanuel and did not want to harm Emmanuel. The two of them fled the scene and disposed their knives in a rubbish chute in the Jurong vicinity. The knives were not recovered.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of public saw the vicious attacks and the Police were called. The Accused and Niswan took a private hire vehicle to Woodlands. They went to a mutual friend’s place and the mutual friend gave the Accused a change of clothes so that the Accused could avoid Police detection. By that night, videos of the incident had gone viral on social media and a manhunt was launched to arrest the Accused and Niswan. Both of them knew that it was a matter of time before they were arrested and they surrendered to the Police the next day.</a></p><a id="p1_17"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Praveen and Saran were conveyed to National University hospital (“NUH”) on the same day.

By this point, reformative training is no longer an appropriate option. It bears reiterating that reformative training lies within the spectrum of rehabilitative sentences (Al-Ansari at [75]; Public Prosecutor v Ong Jack Hong <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19524-SSP.xml')">[2016] 5 SLR 166</a> at [11]; ASR at [134]; see also Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2013) at p 53). Between reformative training and probation, reformative training is the better choice for a young offender for whom rehabilitation remains the principal consideration, but who also needs a measure of deterrence. But where, as in this case, rehabilitation has been displaced as the dominant sentencing consideration, reformative training ceases ordinarily to be a viable option and the appropriate sentences must be the legislatively prescribed options such as imprisonment and caning.”</em> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court in <em>Boaz</em>, at [30] stated that “<em>the focus on rehabilitation can be diminished or even eclipsed by such considerations as deterrence or retribution where the circumstances warrant.

He had brandished his 23.5 cm-long-blade bread knife in public, swung it at Praveen’s head the moment he saw him and used it to slash Praveen’s hand. With knife in hand, the Accused gave chase when Praveen attempted to flee and he continued to use the knife to slash Praveen on his upper torso and hands. The Accused was relentless in his attack as he continued to pursue Praveen, and along with Niswan (the co-accused), they slashed his head and torso again. As mentioned in the Statement of Facts<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a>, there was a total of three separate locations in the vicinity of Block 175 Boon Lay Drive that Praveen was attacked, resulting in multiple slash wounds. These were near the carpark, outside a coffeeshop and also a walkway near a main road, in a residential neighbourhood, in broad daylight. The use of violence by the Accused was both blatant<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> and brazen<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Culpability of the Accused</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manner in which the Accused had planned the attack was also highly premeditated.

On the day in question, the Accused and Niswan concealed the knives in the waistband of their pants, tracked Praveen’s movements through his social media account and laid in wait for Praveen in the vicinity of Block 175 Boon Lay Drive. This was not an attack on a victim which arose from spontaneous events or an event which happened on the spur of the moment, but one which was carefully planned and executed by the Accused.

Prosecution submitted that offences of this type created deep public disquiet and deterrent sentences were necessary to prevent the proliferation of such offences. There was also a need to send a message to future youthful offenders in public who act similarly.

On 3 June 2020, the Accused was again ordered to undergo probation for 21 months, for being a member of an unlawful assembly under section 143 of the Penal Code.

As pointed out by the Prosecution, at the tender age of 12, the Accused was already involved in a fight outside school where he was issued a police warning. At 14 years old, he committed an offence of wilful trespass and was given a 12-month conditional warning and placed on the Guidance Programme. Thereafter, as his antecedents reflect, the Accused was placed on two rounds of probation. Even whilst on probation, he received several verbal, written and court warnings for breaching time restriction. On one of these occasions, he committed a fresh offence of rioting. On his second term of probation (for rioting and for being a member of an unlawful assembly), the Accused again failed to abide by his time restriction and was involved in a fight in February 2021, for which he was given a warning<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46">46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent to the second order of probation, the Accused went on to commit an offence under section 323 of the Penal Code - that of causing hurt – which formed the subject matter of one of the charges now taken into consideration (MAC 905948/2022). Whilst he was on police bail for the TIC offence, he committed this current offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt with dangerous weapon, against two victims – Praveen and Saran. After being charged in court and released on bail, the Accused breached his bail conditions.
