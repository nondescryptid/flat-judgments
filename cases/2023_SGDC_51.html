The crux of DC 614 was that the respondents had provided monies for the purchase of the Company’s shares, which were then held in Anbalagan’s name. The Company operated a nightclub called “Club Rumours” at the Concorde Hotel and Shopping Mall, which Anbalagan managed. Anbalagan later took the position that the Company and its business belonged solely to him. The respondents then commenced DC 614 for a declaration that Anbalagan was holding the Company and its business on trust for them, as well as an account of profits and/or damages.</a></p><a id="p1_3"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The respondents alleged that in the midst of the DC 614 proceedings, Anbalagan transferred the entirety of the Company’s shares to his wife, the appellant, on or around 7 September 2020.</a></p><a id="p1_4"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, Anbalagan was adjudged bankrupt on 24 June 2021. On 20 January 2022, the respondents obtained leave of court to prosecute DC 614. Anbalagan was not granted leave by the private trustee in bankruptcy to defend DC 614. The respondents then entered judgment in default of defence for the following orders:</a></p><a id="p1_5"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is declared that the Defendant is holding the company, The Chillout Place (UEN no. 201117758M) and its business on trust on behalf of the Plaintiffs;</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is declared that all the shares of the company, The Chillout Place (UEN no. 201117758M), are to be split equally between the Plaintiffs;</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant is to account for the collections and/or profits of The Chillout Place's (UEN no. 201117758M) business from 1st December 2019 to date, or in the alternative, the Defendant is to reimburse the sum of $220,000.00 to the Plaintiffs;</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damages to be assessed at hearing;</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Costs in the sum of $3,045.69 payable by the Defendant to the Plaintiffs.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(the “<b>DC 614 JID</b>”).</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After obtaining the DC 614 JID, the respondents commenced the present claim against the appellant.

The foundation of the claim against her was the declaration made in the DC 614 JID that Anbalagan held the Company’s shares and business on trust for the respondents. As such, if the DC 614 JID was irregular, then the entire claim against her should fall away.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, she argued that the respondents were precluded by way of an election or estoppel from commencing the present claim. Her argument was that they had chosen to file a proof of debt against Anbalagan’s bankruptcy estate. As such, they had irrevocably chosen to pursue repayment of money as a remedy and was thus precluded from maintaining that the Company’s shares and business were held on trust for them.</a></p><a id="p1_9"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For completeness, the appellant had advanced a third argument in written submissions that the respondents were barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata</em> from bringing the present claim because of the overlapping issues with DC 614. However, this was not pursued in oral argument by the appellant’s counsel, which was a correct decision given that it was a non-starter. The respondents’ claim against the appellant only arose after Anbalagan transferred the Company’s shares to the appellant, which in turn only took place after the respondents commenced DC 614. Thereafter, DC 614 concluded by way of the DC 614 JID without any decision on the merits. None of the three subspecies of <em>res judicata</em>, namely cause of action estoppel, issue estoppel, or the extended doctrine of <em>res judicata</em> would apply. As this argument was not pursued further, I will say no more on it.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The applicable principles for a striking out application under O 9 r 16(1)(a) of the Rules of Court 2021</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O 9 r 16(1) of the Rules of Court 2021 (“ROC 2021”) provides:</a></p><a id="p1_11"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">16.—(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court may order any or part of any pleading to be struck out or amended, on the ground that —</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence;</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is an abuse of process of the Court; or</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is in the interests of justice to do so,</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">and may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered accordingly.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellant relied solely on O 9 r 16(1)(a) – that the respondents’ claim disclosed no reasonable cause of action.</a></p><a id="p1_12"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Iskandar bin Rahmat and others v Attorney-General and another</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27816-SSP.xml')">[2022] SGCA 58</a> at [17], the Court of Appeal explained that:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Under O 9 r 16(1)(<em>a</em>) [of] ROC [2021], the test is whether the action has some chance of success when only the allegations in the pleadings are concerned: <em>Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1997] 3 SLR(R) 0649.xml')">[1997] 3 SLR(R) 649</a> (“<em>Gabriel Peter</em>”) at [21].

The appellant relied on <em>Wallersteiner v Moir (no 2)</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/English/66730-E-M.xml')">[1975] QB 373</a> for the proposition.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellant argued that the foundation for the respondents’ claim against her was the declaration in the DC 614 JID that Anbalagan held the Company and its business on trust for them. Without this foundation, it would not be wrong for Anbalagan to transfer the Company’s shares to the appellant. As the DC 614 JID was irregular, the claim against her was therefore devoid of foundation and ought to be struck out.</a></p><a id="p1_18"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not think that the claim could be struck out on this basis.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in my view, the question of whether the DC 614 JID was irregularly entered was not relevant.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_20-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the DC 614 JID was obtained irregularly, the DC 614 JID was not a nullity. The DC 614 JID was entered into pursuant to O 19 of ROC 2014. O 2 r 1(1) of ROC 2014 specifically provides that any failure to comply with the requirements of the rules shall be treated as an irregularity and shall not nullify the judgment.</a></p><a id="p1_20-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_20-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, the DC 614 JID was entered and subsists on the record. It is not a nullity and no one applied to set it aside. As long as it subsists, the respondents are entitled to treat it as any other judgment and enforce it accordingly. Unless and until a court sets aside the DC 614 JID, it continues to remain in effect.</a></p><a id="p1_20-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the respondents have pleaded a number of causes of action against the appellant as set out at [6] above. The appellant did not address the individual causes of action or explain why each of those heads disclosed no reasonable cause of action. Her main point was that the DC 614 JID was the foundation of all of those causes of action, and if it was taken away, the claim had to be struck out.</a></p><a id="p1_21"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not agree.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I begin with [16] of the Statement of Claim, which reads:</a></p><a id="p1_23"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Pursuant to the [DC 614 JID], as a trustee holding the Company, the Shares in the Company and its business (the “Trust Property”) on trust for the [respondents], Anbalagan owed the fiduciary duties to the [respondents]…</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The claim was that Anbalagan held the Company’s shares and business on trust for the respondents. While the pleading started with the words “[p]ursuant to the [DC 614 JID]”, the material averment was clear: That Anbalagan was a trustee and owed fiduciary duties to the respondents.</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[17] of the Statement of Claim proceeded to state that Anbalagan acted in breach of trust by transferring the Company’s shares to the appellant. [21] specified that the appellant had actual knowledge that the transfer took place in breach of trust, and [23] claimed that the appellant was therefore a trustee of the Company’s shares as well and owed fiduciary duties to the respondents.</a></p><a id="p1_25"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of pleadings is to properly demarcate the parameters of each party’s case and to prevent parties from being caught by surprise at trial (<em>Tat Seng Machine Movers Pte Ltd v Orix Leasing Singapore Ltd</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2009] 4 SLR(R) 1101.xml')">[2009] 4 SLR(R) 1101</a> at [76]). It was clear what the main thrust of the respondents' case was: that the appellant held the Company’s shares and business on trust for them because she knew that Anbalagan transferred those shares to her in breach of trust.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the DC 614 JID was later set aside, the respondents could simply aver as a material fact that Anbalagan held the Company’s shares and business on trust for them. They bear the burden of proving that Anbalagan was the trustee of the shares, but it did not mean that their claim disclosed no reasonable cause of action.</a></p><a id="p1_27"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I addressed one further point. In oral argument, the respondents suggested that it was no longer open for the appellant to advance the defence that Anbalagan held the Company’s shares and business on trust for the respondents, and that the appellant was bound by the DC 614 JID. The appellant was understandably troubled by this.</a></p><a id="p1_28"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not agree with the respondents. The DC 614 JID determined the rights and liabilities between the parties in that suit, namely the respondents and Anbalagan. It was entered without an evidential hearing and without any substantive findings on the merits. The appellant was not party to DC 614 and the DC 614 JID is not binding on her. As such, it remained the respondents’ burden to prove in this case that Anbalagan held the Company’s shares and business on trust for them, and it remained open to the appellant to defend the present claim by pleading and proving that regardless of the DC 614 JID, Anbalagan was the beneficial owner of the Company’s shares and that there was therefore no wrongdoing when he transferred the shares to the Appellant. It remained open to the court hearing the present claim to examine the facts and come to its own conclusion in determining the rights and liabilities between the parties.</a></p><a id="p1_29"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Estoppel / Election</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellant’s second argument was that by filing the proof of debt against Anbalagan’s bankruptcy estate, the claimants had irrevocably elected to pursue their remedy for a money claim in bankruptcy, and therefore abandoned their trust claim over the Company’s shares. Anbalagan had relied on their participation in the bankruptcy regime and made payments to the private trustee. As such, it was no longer open to the claimants to pursue the claim that Anbalagan held the shares on trust, and their claim against the appellant should be struck out.</a></p><a id="p1_30"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, this argument was a non-starter because it had nothing to do with whether the respondents’ Statement of Claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action. The appellant limited her application to O 9 r 16(1)(a) of ROC 2021, for which no evidence is admissible pursuant to O 9 r 16(2).</a></p><a id="p1_31"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the fact that Anbalagan was adjudged a bankrupt, there is nothing in the Statement of Claim about whether the respondents had filed a proof of debt or whether Anbalagan had made payments in reliance thereof.</a></p><a id="p1_32"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, this argument fails at the threshold.</a></p><a id="p1_33"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In oral arguments, the respondents further pointed out that the proof of debt that they filed simply reflected the terms of the DC 614 JID without making any election, and also pointed to affidavit evidence to show that they had since withdrawn their proof of debt. Finally, it was brought to my attention that the proof of debt was bad to begin with in that it wrongly named the respondents’ solicitors (instead of the respondent) as the creditor.</a></p><a id="p1_34"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These evidential arguments were not relevant in an application under O 9 r 16(1)(a) of ROC 2021, which was focused solely on whether the action has some chance of success when <em>only the allegations in the pleadings are concerned</em>. However, if the appellant had brought her application on some other ground, I would have been persuaded by the respondents’ arguments that their claim should not be struck out just because they filed an erroneous proof of debt.</a></p><a id="p1_35"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I dismissed the appellant’s application with costs. The respondents’ counsel submitted a figure of $3,000 inclusive of disbursements. The appellant’s counsel asked for costs to be reserved and declined to make any submissions on the appropriate quantum of costs. As I found the respondents’ proposal of $3,000 reasonable, I awarded it accordingly.</a></p><a id="p1_36"> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"></a><p class="Footnote"><a id="p1_36"><sup></sup></a><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a>Statement of Claim, [16].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>Statement of Claim, [17].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>Statement of Claim, [20].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>Statement of Claim, [23].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_5_1" id="Ftn_5">[note: 5]</a></sup>Statement of Claim, [24].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_6_1" id="Ftn_6">[note: 6]</a></sup>Statement of Claim, [25] – [28].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_7_1" id="Ftn_7">[note: 7]</a></sup>Statement of Claim, [29] – [31].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_8_1" id="Ftn_8">[note: 8]</a></sup>Statement of Claim, [32] – [33].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_9_1" id="Ftn_9">[note: 9]</a></sup>Statement of Claim, [34] – [35].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_10_1" id="Ftn_10">[note: 10]</a></sup>Statement of Claim, [36] – [38].</p></div></content></html>
