According to Insp Rohana, she was conducting an investigation in relation to a cheating offence when she recorded the statement in P22 from the Accused. The victim in that case had lodged a police report (Exhibit P24) alleging that she lent money on seven occasions to a “Victor Bonett” whom she got to know from Facebook. She was told to transfer the sums into various bank accounts, and on two of those occasions, the amounts were paid into the DBS Account.

At the conclusion of the hearing, both parties made oral submissions on the admissibility of the P22 and P23.

Hence, the prosecution argued that evidence fell squarely within Explanation 1 to section 14 of the EA and should therefore be admitted.</a></p><a id="p1_29"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the prosecution relied on the High Court’s decision in <em>PP v Mas Swan Bin Adnan and another</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGHC 0107.xml')">[2011] SGHC 107</a> (“<em>Mas Swan</em>”) and took the view that once evidence was deemed relevant under the EA, the Court did not have any residual discretion to exclude such evidence. The prosecution pointed to [106] of <em>Mas Swan</em> where the High Court noted that the court of three judges in <em>Law Society of Singapore v Tan Guat Neo Phyllis</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 2 SLR(R) 0239.xml')">[2008] 2 SLR(R) 239</a> ruled that under the EA, “all relevant evidence is admissible unless specifically expressed to be inadmissible.” It was further noted that in <em>Lee Chez Kee v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 3 SLR(R) 0447.xml')">[2008] 3 SLR(R) 447</a>, the Court of Appeal observed that the courts had no residual discretion to exclude evidence deemed legally relevant under the EA. As for the Court of Appeal’s earlier decision in <em>Tan Meng Jee v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1996] 2 SLR(R) 0178.xml')">[1996] 2 SLR(R) 178</a> (“<em>Tan Meng Jee</em>”), which adopted the balancing test in <em>Director of Public Prosecutions v Boardman</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/English/66818-E-M.xml')">[1975] AC 421</a> in assessing admissibility under sections 14 and 15 of the EA, the High Court in <em>Mas Swan</em> at [107] observed that this would be inconsistent with the EA in so far as it allowed for the exclusion of similar fact evidence that was otherwise deemed relevant under those provisions. Based on the foregoing, the prosecution submitted that once the Court found that the evidence in P22 and P23 fell within the categories enumerated in section 14 of the EA, there was no discretion for the Court to exclude them.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence disagreed with the prosecution’s reading of the decision in <em>Mas Swan</em> and submitted that the position in law remained that which was set out in <em>Tan Meng Jee</em> at [49]. The defence argued that the High Court in <em>Mas Swan</em> decided that it was not necessary to rely on similar fact evidence in convicting the offender. Thus, the High Court’s comments in that case, in relation to sections 14 and 15 of the EA, were <em>obiter</em>. The defence further submitted that the High Court was not in a position to overrule the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>Tan Meng Jee</em> and more importantly, the Court of Appeal in <em>Muhammed bin Kadar and another v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/12985-SSP-M.xml')">[2011] 3 SLR 1205</a> had ruled, at [51], that there existed a common law discretion to exclude evidence in which the prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the evidence sought to be admitted by the prosecution in this case, the defence argued that the Accused was not being investigated as an accused person when P22 was recorded and there was an absence of any information given to her which would allow her to know exactly what was going on. The defence further contended that all the Accused was asked about in P22 was her receipt of the money, and the contents of P22 did not bear any resemblance to the facts of the present case. The Accused was not told the name of the complainant nor the reasons the complainant made the transfer. The defence submitted that since receiving money itself was a commonplace occurrence and not a crime and the Accused was told, about one month later, that she had “done nothing wrong”, there was nothing to indicate to her that anything was amiss. Therefore, if the prosecution were to rely on P22 and P23 just to show that the Accused had monies deposited into her account, that would be too general.</a></p><a id="p1_32"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the defence tested P22 and P23 using the factors of cogency, strength of inference and relevance enunciated in <em>Cross on Evidence</em> which was cited with approval in <em>Tan Meng Jee</em> at [52]. The defence submitted that the evidence sought to be tendered was not cogent as it related to an event which occurred in excess of two years before the alleged commission of the offences on which the Accused was tried. Highlighting the case of <em>PP v Beh Chew Boo</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24155-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGHC 33</a> at [16], the defence submitted that the similar fact evidence in that case was rejected due to lack of cogency as the text messages in question were sent about a month earlier. The defence acknowledged, however, that on appeal, the Court of Appeal in <em>Beh Chew Boo v PP</em> [2020] 2 SLR 1357 observed that the intervening period between the messages was not so long that they could not be said to be cogent or relevant to the offences before the court. Turning to the facts of this case, the defence contended that even if the Accused could be said to have received a warning previously, it would be unrealistic to expect that it would still remain fresh in her mind two to three years later.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response, the prosecution agreed that when assessing relevance and in considering whether the evidence would fall within Explanation 1 to section 14 of the EA, there was a measure of balance that the Court would have to strike on how particular or general the past behaviour was. In the present case, the prosecution submitted that the Accused was essentially running the same “errand” for the same person in both instances. There were also other commonalities between the past transactions evidenced by P22 and P23, and those in the present case, in that they involved (a) the same DBS Account, (b) someone Mark claimed was related to him, and (c) the Accused being given instructions to move money deposited in her account out of jurisdiction. Additionally, the prosecution submitted that the defence had over-simplified the contents of P23. The prosecution was of the view that a few points stated therein would have raised alarm bells in the Accused even though she was not prosecuted. As for the question of whether and to what extent the earlier events operated in the Accused’s mind in 2018, the prosecution submitted that this was not relevant for consideration for the purposes of the ancillary hearing to determine the admissibility of the evidence.</a></p><a id="p1_34"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">P22 and P23 were admitted into evidence</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the admissibility of P22 and P23, as evidence of facts showing the existence of a state of mind of the Accused – that she had reasonable grounds to believe that the monies in question represented Mark’s benefits from criminal conduct -- must primarily be assessed based the requirements specified in section 14 of the EA. Section 14 of the EA (read with Explanation 1) set out the following qualifying factors:</a></p><a id="p1_35"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35"></a><a id="p1_35-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the existence of the state of mind must be in issue at the proceedings; and</a></p><a id="p1_35-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_35-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fact must show that the relevant state of mind existed not generally but in reference to the particular matter in question.</a></p><a id="p1_35-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering admissibility, I found illustration (n) to section 14 of the EA to be instructive:</a></p><a id="p1_36"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>n</em>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>A</em> sues <em>B</em> for negligence in providing <em>A</em> with a motor car for hire not reasonably fit for use whereby <em>A</em> was injured.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The fact that <em>B’s</em> attention was drawn on other occasions to the defect of that particular motor car is relevant.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The fact that <em>B</em> was habitually negligent about the motor cars which <em>B</em> let to hire is irrelevant.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying the above considerations to the present case, I was of the view that P22 and P23 were relevant evidence under section 14 of the EA and should be admitted. Firstly, as set out earlier in these grounds, the overarching issue in contention at trial was whether the Accused had reasonable grounds to believe that the money which formed the subject matter of each charge were Mark’s benefits from criminal conduct. Thus, evidence that would go towards showing the existence of this particular state of mind, would be considered relevant. Secondly, juxtaposing the agreed facts in the ASOF against the contents of P22 and P23, it could not be disputed that the police investigations in 2016 related to similar transactions concerning:</a></p><a id="p1_37"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37"></a><a id="p1_37-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the same DBS Account;</a></p><a id="p1_37-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_37-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;monies transferred into the DBS Account by persons purportedly associated with Mark but unknown to the Accused, without her prior knowledge; and</a></p><a id="p1_37-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_37-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instructions given by Mark to the Accused to transfer these monies out of jurisdiction.</a></p><a id="p1_37-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the above, it was quite clear to me that the evidence in P22 and P23 would relate to the existence of the relevant state of mind in reference to the specific matter in question at this trial.</a></p><a id="p1_38"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In assessing admissibility, I had also carefully considered the following arguments canvassed by the defence:</a></p><a id="p1_39"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39"></a><a id="p1_39-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the investigations in 2016, the Accused was not given sufficient background information relating to the transactions, including details of the victim’s complaint. Thus, coupled with the fact that the Accused was told that she did not do anything wrong, there was nothing to raise alarm bells or indicate to her that anything was amiss.</a></p><a id="p1_39-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_39-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if P22 and P23 fell within the ambit of section 14 of the EA, the Court should nonetheless exercise its discretion to exclude the evidence as it did not pass the test of cogency, strength of inference and relevance. The evidence sought to be tendered was not cogent as it related to an event which occurred in excess of two years before the alleged commission of the offences on which the Accused was tried.</a></p><a id="p1_39-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_40">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to the defence’s contention that the Accused was not given sufficient details in 2016 to raise suspicions on her part, I was of the view that this did not detract from the relevance of the evidence in P22 and P23. Firstly, the defence did not lead any evidence during the ancillary hearing in support of their submission that the Accused was told by the police that she had “done nothing wrong”. To the contrary, the letter in P23 which was addressed to the Accused and received by her, made reference to a “police report” and stated that it served as “official notice” that the funds the Accused received in the DBS Account were “derived from fraud transactions”. Additionally, the Accused was expressly advised to refrain from receiving or dealing with funds from “unknown and /or dubious sources” and warned that this may render her “liable to prosecution” for offences under the Penal Code or CDSA.</a></p><a id="p1_40"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a><a id="p1_41">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In deciding on admissibility, I had also considered the issue as to whether the Court retained a residual discretion to exclude evidence admitted through the application of section 14 of the EA. Having carefully studied the case law highlighted by the parties during their submissions, it appeared to me that the position in law was not entirely clear. I also noted that while there were provisions in the EA which expressly provided the court with discretion to exclude evidence which would otherwise be relevant<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a>, the EA was silent with regard to such a discretion to exclude facts which were relevant pursuant to section 14 of EA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be that as it may, I decided to err on the side of caution and took a further look at P22 and P23 to evaluate their cogency and reliability, and to determine whether the prejudice caused to the Accused, if they were admitted, would outweigh their probative value. In considering this issue, it was pertinent to note that the defence did not raise any concerns regarding procedural impropriety, voluntariness, or accuracy in the recording of P22. As for P23, it was a formal letter from the police addressed to the Accused and signed by “OC Commercial Crime Squad Central Division”. The defence did not dispute the Accused’s signature thereon, or that she had received a copy of the same. As for the question of whether, and how much the Accused could recall of the earlier investigations when the events set out in the charges took place, this would not, in my view, impact my finding on the relevance and admissibility of the evidence during the ancillary hearing.</a></p><a id="p1_42"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a><a id="p1_43">43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, having additionally considered the overall reliability of P22 and P23, and weighed this against the potential prejudice to the Accused, I concluded that P22 and P23 should be admitted pursuant to section 14 of the EA as evidence of facts which were relevant to show the Accused’s state of mind at the time of the offences.</a></p><a id="p1_43"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Investigation Officer’s evidence </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a><a id="p1_44">44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IO Shen was the other prosecution witness for the trial.

The Accused elected to testify. The Accused also called her daughter, Miss Puteri Nurul Binte Shawal (DW2) to give evidence relating to the circumstances leading to the Accused’s divorce, their living conditions after the divorce, and what she knew of the Accused’s relationship with Mark.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a> The salient parts of the Accused’s evidence are summarised below.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">DW1 – Merlur Binte Ahmad</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46">46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused testified that she had divorced her ex-husband in 2012 due to him borrowing heavily to feed his gambling habits. As they had sold their matrimonial home, the Accused and her children moved into a rented room in her sister’s flat, where they stayed until the Accused obtained a new flat in 2018. The Accused’s ex-husband did not contribute to the children’s expenses and the Accused single-handedly provided for their needs. Although the Accused had 13 siblings, they were unable to help her as they had their own commitments and problems. Instead, the Accused was the one who would accompany her siblings for their medical appointments to help them communicate with their doctors as well as seek financial assistance from the social workers.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Accused was in love with Mark and planned to marry him</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47">47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused first met Mark through Facebook in 2012, soon after her divorce. Mark told her that he was a single, 54-year-old from Manchester, United Kingdoms and held a “professional degree in petrochemical”. They communicated frequently and the Accused confided in Mark about her problems as she had no one else to share her feelings with. Mark showed that he cared for the Accused and regarded her children as his own. Mark also expressed his love for the Accused. He told the Accused that he wanted to come to Singapore to marry her and be a father figure to her children. Mark also told the Accused that his mother was happy for them and accepted her children as her own grandchildren. The Accused was very touched as her ex-husband never expressed his feelings towards her or showed his concern towards the children. The Accused fell deeply in love with Mark as a result.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48">48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2016, Mark told the Accused that his Facebook account was hacked and they started communicating through YM. After 18 July 2018, Mark switched to communicating with the Accused on Google Hangout. The Accused had spoken with Mark over the phone and seen his photographs on Facebook. However, she had neither met him nor seen him “live” in a video-call. The Accused had also never communicated with or met anyone associated with Mark. She had never received any documents which supported what he told her about himself and / or his circumstances.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Accused helped Mark with his financial problems</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49">49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime in 2014 or 2015, Mark told the Accused that he could only come to Singapore to marry her after settling his own personal problems. Mark told the Accused that he did not pay his income tax when he was working in the United States and his account was frozen as a result. Due to this, he had difficulty getting employment and could not even afford to buy food or medication for himself. Mark complained to the Accused that he had several medical problems including painful and swollen legs, stomach pains and swollen gums. Mark also told the Accused that he had incurred a medical bill of GBP 4320 when he was serving a prison sentence and that he had to go to Court and settle the payment. Mark mentioned that he had wanted to kill himself because of his problems but added that the Accused and her children brought him hope. The Accused sympathised with Mark and, over the years from 2013 to 2018, transferred various sums of money to help him. Mark provided the Accused with a bank account number for this purpose. The bank account purportedly belonging to one Omoragbon Aideyan (“Omo”) in Malaysia.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a> The Accused was told that Omo worked for Mark’s business partner, “Alfred” who was based in Brunei.

In order to obtain a court date and to settle the matter expeditiously, Mark was required to submit a sealed copy of the contract with his Bruneian clients to the court. To this end, Mark informed the Accused that he needed GBP 600 to courier the documents to Brunei for sealing, and for them to be sent back to him. The Accused was shocked by the cost of the courier services but eventually decided to help Mark. However, even after the documents had purportedly reached Brunei, the Accused was told that Alfred did not have the money to pay for his own transportation to send the documents to their clients for endorsement. Mark also claimed that Alfred did not receive part of the money sent by the Accused for the courier service. The Accused proceeded to send more money to make up for the shortfall.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52">52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2018, Mark told the Accused that he was trying to sell his house in Manchester in order to settle his tax payment. Mark said that he was told by his agent that the best way to market the house was to place it in an “exhibition”. Mark needed money to promote his house to potential buyers as well as pay for the monthly insurance for the house pending its sale. Mark also told the Accused that if he did not pay for the insurance for the house, he would not be able to proceed with the sale. The Accused believed Mark when he promised that he would return the Accused all the money she had transferred to him and help pay for her debts (including the mortgage and renovation for her new flat). Mark also vouched that he would “spoil” the Accused by taking care of the finances of the family so that the Accused would not need to work so hard.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a> Nevertheless, the Accused would at times remind Mark that she could not help him all the time as she also had her own problems.

id="p1_54">54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 25 May 2018, the Accused sent the details of the DBS Account to Mark via YM. According to the Accused, this was to facilitate Mark returning all the monies she had sent him. The Accused added that she had previously given Mark the same account number in 2013 when she first started helping him financially. That was because Mark had promised her that he would pay her back. However, the Accused had not received a single cent back from Mark.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55">55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 10 July 2018, Mark again asked the Accused for her bank account details “for confirmation”. In response, the Accused sent the DBS Account particulars again. The Accused testified that she did not know what Mark’s intention was at that time but thought perhaps he wanted to return her the money. Mark also mentioned that his client in Brunei was ready to pay him and they would “try with little amount first”. The Accused then queried Mark whether his client was making payment directly into her account but did not receive a response. The following day, the Accused sent Mark a message stating that she doubted if Mark’s client would pay her directly as he had previously mentioned that his client would do so but the Accused did not receive any money. <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The investigations in 2016</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56">56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused agreed that on 15 and 26 October 2015, she had assisted Mark to transfer two sums of money ($5,545 and $2,807 respectively), which were transferred into the DBS Account earlier, out of the account. The Accused was initially unaware that the monies were deposited into her account. It was only after the deposits were made that Mark told her that his friend’s fiancée wanted to transfer money to his friend in Brunei but did not know how to effect the transfer. Mark did not seek the Accused’s permission before allegedly telling his friend’s fiancée to transfer the two sums into the DBS Account. This was despite the Accused telling Mark not to share her account details with others without her knowledge. At her interview with Insp Rohana on 6 April 2016, the Accused was informed that someone had made a complaint in relation to these transfers into the DBS Account. The Accused was not told who the complainant was nor the nature of the complaint. As it was her first time attending an interview at a police station, the Accused was in a panicked state such that each time a question was posed to her by Insp Rohana, she was not sure what was being asked. The Accused did not inform Insp Rohana that she was in a relationship with Mark because she felt embarrassed about telling others about it. However, if she had been told the details of the police report in P24, she would not have continued her relationship with him.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57">57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused confronted Mark about the October 2015 transactions after receiving the call from Insp Rohana to attend the interview. Mark assured her that the money was for his friend and suggested that the complaint might have arisen from a misunderstanding between the complainant or Mark’s friend, and the friend’s fiancée. Mark also promised not to use the DBS Account to help others.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58">58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several months later, the Accused was informed by Insp Rohana that the matter was “settled” and asked to attend at the police station to receive a letter. The Accused formed the impression that she did nothing wrong. At the police station, the Accused was met by another officer who served P23 to her and asked her to sign to acknowledge receipt. The Accused went home after receiving the letter and did not read it because she did not know that it was important. She placed it in one of the boxes in her room and subsequently forgot about it.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The transactions in the proceeded charges </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59">59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regards to the transactions in the present case, the Accused only knew that a transfer had been made into the DBS Account when Mark sent her a message in Hangout to alert her. Mark did not give her prior notice of the funds coming in. He told her that all these sums (save for the $300 transferred into the account on or about 10 August 2018) were payments made by his Bruneian client. As for the $300, the Accused was told that it was a loan from Mark’s friend.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60">60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused explained that while she used internet banking services, she did not know how to access her bank statements from her internet banking account. It was only when Mark informed her that the money had been transferred into the DBS Account that she would check the balance in her account to confirm that the deposit was indeed made. At the material time, the Accused did not know how to verify the source of the transfers.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61">61&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the monies were deposited into her account, Mark would ask her to transfer them to an account belonging to “Hunterman Enterprise” so as to make payment towards the tax he owed. The Accused did not know anything about the entity but thought it was related to Mark’s business. In addition, there were two transactions where Mark instructed the Accused to transfer sums into Omo’s bank account in Malaysia. Mark told her these were meant to be paid to the “ministry” for the issuance of a document which would allow Mark to receive further payments from his clients.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62">62&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Accused was first notified by Mark on 17 July 2018 that the first transfer had been made into the DBS Account, the Accused responded by asking Mark for supporting documents (see D3, page 1). In Court, the Accused explained that this was because the customers she dealt with in the course of her work would invariably provide a payment slip as evidence of payment. There was also an occasion when the bank called her to ask for the purpose of a transaction. The Accused therefore wanted the documents as proof that she was receiving legitimate funds. In response, Mark questioned whether the Accused would be able to receive much larger amounts from his clients involving transactions worth “600k m” (meaning S$600,000 million), if she were to insist on documentation. The Accused reminded Mark that he should not be allowing unknown persons to use her account. She suggested that Mark wait for his account to be unfrozen so that the payments could be transferred directly to him. She also asked him for details on the nature of his business (see D3, pages 2 and 3) because the sum transferred to her DBS Account was a “big amount”. Mark tried to convince the Accused that the monies were from a government ministry in Brunei, and that she had nothing to worry about.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63">63&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused did not keep any of the money that were transferred into the DBS Account for herself as the money did not belong to her.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The investigations in 2018</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64">64&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After she was informed by IO Alan Kit to attend an interview on 16 August 2018, the Accused contacted Mark to ask him for the payment slips so that she could show them to the police. She also quizzed Mark on the source and purpose of the transfers.

In their submissions at the close of the defence’s case, the defence referred to two English cases which dealt with similar offences under the UK Proceeds of Crime Act 2002,<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a> and argued that for an offence of acquiring criminal proceeds to be made out under the CDSA, the property in question must be criminal property prior to it being transferred to the offender. After considering the defence’s submissions, the prosecution took the position that the charges under the “acquisition” limb were <em>evidentially</em> deficient as it was an agreed fact that the Accused was not aware of the sums entering the DBS Account at the point of time they were transferred to her. Hence, the prosecution applied to the Court to exercise its discretion under section 128(1) of the CPC to amend the charges to those under the “possession” limb, with consequential changes to the dates of the offences and the relevant particulars in the charges.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68">68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having carefully considered the submissions from both parties in this regard, I allowed the prosecution’s application to amend the charges. It was also at this juncture, that the prosecution decided to withdraw the 8<sup>th</sup> charge.</a></p><a id="p1_68"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a><a id="p1_69">69&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the amendments to the 1<sup>st</sup> to 7<sup>th</sup> charges were effected, the defence renewed their challenge to the amended charges under the “possession” limb. It is to this that I shall now turn.</a></p><a id="p1_69"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Specific challenges to the “possession” charges</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a><a id="p1_70">70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to the “possession” charges, section 47(3) of the CDSA stated:</a></p><a id="p1_70"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Any person who, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property is, or in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, represents, another person’s benefits from criminal conduct, acquires that property, or has possession of or uses such property, shall be guilty of an offence.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(emphasis added)</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a><a id="p1_71">71&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall first deal with the defence’s contention that the possession charges under section 47(3) of the CDSA must fail for being defective in law. In support of this argument, the defence referred to the definition of “possession” under section 2 of the CDSA as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_71"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“possession” in relation to any property, means actual or constructive possession of the property.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a><a id="p1_72">72&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence then proceeded to highlight what it described as an “often cited” example of actual or constructive possession of a car, and surmised that that actual or constructive possession of “property” in the context of the CDSA must be similarly be directed at physical property. As a bank account was regarded in law as a chose in action and monies in an account was not physical property, the defence concluded that the Accused could not be regarded as being in possession of the monies in the DBS Account.</a></p><a id="p1_72"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a><a id="p1_73">73&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having carefully studied the defence’s submissions in this regard, I was of the view that they were wholly misconceived. In anchoring their arguments on the definition of “possession” in section 2 of the CDSA, the defence had completely disregarded the meaning of “property” as set out in the same section as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_73"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“property” means money and all other property, movable or immovable, including <em>things in action and other intangible or incorporeal property</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(emphasis added)</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a><a id="p1_74">74&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, a literal reading of the definition of “property” in the CDSA left no room for doubt that “property” in this context included choses in action as well as other non-physical property. Conversely, adopting a restrictive meaning of “property” in a possession charge under section 47(3) of the CDSA as proposed by the defence would not only detract from the clear ambit of the term as defined in statute but also result in the untenable outcome of ascribing different meanings to the same term in the same Act. Taken to its logical conclusion, the defence’s position would mean that while “property” in an “acquisition” or “usage” offence under section 47(3) CDSA could include non-physical property, the same would not be true for a possession charge prosecuted under the same provision. I further agreed with the prosecution’s submissions that the definition of “property” advocated by the defence would frustrate the legislative intent of the CDSA, which was to combat money-laundering in its myriad forms, including those facilitated by technological advances and conducted electronically.</a></p><a id="p1_74"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a><a id="p1_75">75&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I next turn to deal with the defence’s argument that based on a “purposive interpretation” of sections 47(2) and 47(3) of the CDSA, they created only one offence. Hence, an accused person could only be convicted of an offence under either provision in respect of the same criminal proceeds. The defence relied on the following points in support of their submission:</a></p><a id="p1_75"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75"></a><a id="p1_75-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the defence referred to section 47(1) of the CDSA, which dealt with the laundering of an offender’s own criminal proceeds:</a></p><a id="p1_75-p2_a"> <p class="Judg-Quote-2"> <b>47.</b>—(1) Any person who –</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conceals or disguises any property which is, or in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, represents, his benefits from criminal conduct;</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;converts or transfers that property or removes it from the jurisdiction; or</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acquires, possesses or uses that property,</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-3">shall be guilty of an offence.</p> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_a"></a><a id="">Based on the disjunctive nature of the various offending acts listed therein and the use of the words “an offence”, the defence submitted that on a plain reading, the offender would be liable for only one offence if the prosecution proved any of the offending acts.</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_75-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extrapolating from the above, given the similar wordings in sections 47(2) and 47(3) of the CDSA, the same would be true in that they also created only a single offence of money-laundering.</a></p><a id="p1_75-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_76">76&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ease of reference, I set out, in full, sections 47(2) and 47(3) of the CDSA:</a></p><a id="p1_76"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) Any person who, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property is, or in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, represents, another person’s benefits from criminal conduct –</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conceals or disguises that property; or</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;converts or transfers that property or removes it from the jurisdiction,</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">shall be guilty of an offence.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any person who, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property is, or in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, represents, another person’s benefits from criminal conduct, acquires that property, or has possession of or uses such property, shall be guilty of an offence.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a><a id="p1_77">77&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having carefully deliberated on the defence’s submissions, I disagreed that sections 47(2) and 47(3) of the CDSA created only a single offence and that a person could only be convicted of an offence under one provision with regard to the same criminal proceeds. The defence’s interpretation of section 47(1) of the CDSA as creating a single offence was unsupported by any legal authority. Further, contrary to the defence’s assertions, there was nothing in the plain wordings of the provision itself (or in sections 47(2) or 47(3) of the CDSA) to indicate that a person may only be prosecuted for one offence with regard to the same criminal proceeds. The High Court in the case of <em>Chong Kum Heng v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25021-SSP.xml')">[2020] 4 SLR 1056</a> (“<em>Chong Kum Heng</em>”) dealt with a somewhat similar submission. Counsel for the appellant in <em>Chong Kum Heng</em> submitted that section 47(1)(c) of the CDSA was focused on the offence of “money laundering”, and a purposive interpretation of the CDSA would reveal that section 47(1)(c) was to be read in conjunction with section 47(1)(a). The High Court dismissed the argument and found that on a plain reading, section 47(1)(c) was clearly intended to be read as a stand-alone offence. Pertinently, the High Court held that the term “money laundering” was a generic term and not a term of art and there was no reason to “conflate two separate offence sections.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> In my view, the views expressed by the High Court would apply with equal force to the offence-creating provisions in sections 47(2) and 47(3) CDSA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78">78&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, to constrict the operation of section 47(1) as well as sections 47(2) and 47(3) in the manner proposed by the defence, would, in my opinion, run contrary to the purpose of the CDSA in combating money-laundering in its multifarious forms. This may be illustrated with an example in relation to section 47(1) of the CDSA. Suppose an offender in Singapore who was receiving bribes arranged for the corrupt payments to be deposited into his foreign bank account in order to avoid detection. He later transferred these sums from his foreign bank account into his bank account in Singapore. Subsequently, he used part of these criminal proceeds which he had accumulated in his Singapore bank account to pay for the purchase of a car and an apartment. In such a scenario, the interpretation asserted by the defence would require the law enforcement authorities to undertake the impossible task of distinguishing which part of the sums the offender had transferred into his bank account earlier were used by him for the purchases, so as to ensure that he was only prosecuted for one offence in relation to the same sum. To me, there was really no rational basis as to why the offender could not be prosecuted under section 47(1) of the CDSA both for the transfer as well as subsequent use of his benefits from criminal conduct. The above would be true even if the offender were, as in our case, dealing with another person’s benefits from criminal conduct. I therefore rejected the defence’s argument that the Accused could only be prosecuted for one offence under sections 47(2) or 47(3) of the CDSA with respect to the same sum.</a></p><a id="p1_78"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a><a id="p1_79">79&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now discuss the defence’s argument that the prosecution, in proceeding with the possession charges under section 47(3) of the CDSA together with the removal charges under section 47(2)(b) of the CDSA, offended the rule against double counting. In making this submission, the defence relied on section 40 of the Interpretation Act 1965 (“IA”) as well as the decision of the High Court in <em>Tan Khee Koon v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1995] 3 SLR(R) 0404.xml')">[1995] 3 SLR(R) 404</a> (“<em>Tan Khee Koon</em>”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80">80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 40 of the IA stated:</a></p><a id="p1_80"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where any act or omission constitutes an offence under 2 or more written laws, the offender shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be liable to be prosecuted and punished under any one of those written laws but shall not be liable to be punished twice for the same offence.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a><a id="p1_81">81&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Tan Khee Koon</em>, the High Court, in considering section 40 (then section 41) of the IA, had referred to the meaning of the term “same offence” set out in <em>Jamal bin Adnan v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/MLJ/39684-M.xml')">[1986] 1 MLJ 162</a> (“<em>Jamal</em>”). According to <em>Jamal</em>’s case, two or more offences were the same offence if they had the same essential ingredients. Following from the above, the defence argued that the offence of removal of property from jurisdiction under section 47(2)(b) of the CDSA must necessarily involve an element of possession under section 47(3) of the CDSA. Thus, the defence reasoned that if the Accused were convicted for both the possession as well as removal charges, the former would be duplicitous.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82">82&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having carefully considered the parties’ submissions in relation to this issue, I did not agree with the defence that there was double counting in this case. In my view, the essential ingredients of the possession and removal offences were separate and distinct. In particular, I concurred with the prosecution’s submissions that possession of property was not a necessary ingredient for an offence of removing property out of jurisdiction. This was clearly illustrated by the example given by the prosecution of a person performing an online banking transaction on behalf of another person to transfer the money in the latter’s bank account out of jurisdiction. Thus, the fact that the Accused was in possession of the property prior to her effecting its removal from jurisdiction would not, in my view, prohibit the prosecution from proceeding with offences constituted by each criminal act. To me, this was not a case where the Accused was being punished twice in relation to the same offence.</a></p><a id="p1_82"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a><a id="p1_83">83&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on to consider the final prong of the defence’s challenge to the possession charges -- that possession was not made out as the Accused never intended to “retain” possession of the monies.</a></p><a id="p1_83"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a><a id="p1_84">84&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having carefully considered the evidence before the Court and both parties’ submissions on this point, I was of the view that the Accused did have the requisite <em>mens rea</em> for the possession charges. It was clear from the evidence adduced that when the Accused was informed by Mark that the respective sums had been transferred into her account, she agreed to remain in possession of the monies until such time she transferred the sums out of her account pursuant to Mark’s instructions. Put simply, the Accused’s intention to comply with Mark’s instructions to subsequently transfer the money out was not inconsistent with her having the requisite <em>mens rea</em> to remain in possession of the monies before effecting the transfers.</a></p><a id="p1_84"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Accused had reasonable grounds to believe that the monies were Mark’s benefits from criminal conduct</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a><a id="p1_85">85&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the central issue at trial, which was whether the Accused had reasonable grounds to believe that the sums of money mentioned in the proceeded charges were Mark’s benefits from criminal conduct. This was an essential element of both the charges under section 47(3) as well as section 47(2)(b) of the CDSA.</a></p><a id="p1_85"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a><a id="p1_86">86&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence’s case was that the Accused was herself the victim of a six-year internet love scam and was masterfully manipulated and deceived by Mark at a time when she was most emotionally vulnerable and lonely. Mark caused the Accused to fall deeply in love with him by holding out promises of a loving relationship, marriage and a happy family life. The defence argued that the Accused was an unsophisticated and trusting person who was oblivious to the fraud that was practised on her. As such, blinded by her love for Mark and driven by her compassionate, selfless and caring nature, she sent him numerous sums of money over the years to assist him financially despite her own lack of financial means.</a></p><a id="p1_86"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a><a id="p1_87">87&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time the transactions in question took place, Mark had the Accused eating out of his hand. She genuinely believed his explanations for the deposits in the DBS Account and faithfully followed his instructions to transfer the sums into the two bank accounts designated by him. She had asked Mark for the payment slips because she truly believed that the supporting documents existed, not because there was anything suspicious.</a></p><a id="p1_87"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a><a id="p1_88">88&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence submitted that the prosecution had failed to offer any basis to suggest why the Accused should have reasonable grounds to believe that the monies she received were from an illicit source. In relation to the investigations in 2016, in view of the paucity of information given to her by the police, the Accused could only rely on Mark’s explanation that it was a misunderstanding and that they had done nothing wrong. This was reinforced when the Accused was given P23 and was told that no further action would be taken against her. Given the gap of more than two years between the 2016 investigations and the current offences, it was wholly understandable that the earlier events would not have operated in the Accused’s mind at the material time.</a></p><a id="p1_88"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a><a id="p1_89">89&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prosecution, on the other hand, maintained that the Accused had reasonable grounds to believe that the various sums she was dealing with were benefits of Mark’s criminal conduct. The prosecution relied on three main strands of evidence to establish this:</a></p><a id="p1_89"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89"></a><a id="p1_89-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused’s experience and knowledge from her involvement in police investigations in 2016, regarding similar transactions in 2015;</a></p><a id="p1_89-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_89-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The numerous “red flags” concerning the transactions in question that would have caused a reasonable person in the Accused’s position to believe that the monies involved were benefits of criminal conduct; and</a></p><a id="p1_89-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_89-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused’s actions which showed that her previous encounter with the police was very much on her mind when Mark communicated with her in relation to the transactions.</a></p><a id="p1_89-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_90">90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In assessing the evidence relating to the Accused’s <em>mens rea</em>, I was guided by the test set out in the case of <em>Ang Jeannette v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 4 SLR 0001.xml')">[2011] 4 SLR 1</a> (“<em>Jeannette Ang</em>”) at [70]. Adopting the formulation in <em>Ow Yew Beng v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2003] 1 SLR(R) 0536.xml')">[2003] 1 SLR(R) 536</a> at [10], the High Court in <em>Jeanette Ang</em> explained that having reason to believe involved a lesser degree of conviction than certainty but a higher one than speculation. Further, in applying the test, the court must assume the position of the actual individual involved (<em>ie</em>, including his knowledge and experience), but must reason (<em>ie</em>, infer from the facts known to such individual) from that position like an objective reasonable man.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91">91&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I began my assessment by examining the Accused’s background, knowledge and experience. In this regard, it was undisputed that though the Accused only had O-level qualifications, she had been employed as an assistance manager in the operation department of a Japanese marine paint company for a number of years, handling orders and dealing with invoices for clients hailing from different parts of the world. Thus, it was quite clear that the Accused had some degree of knowledge and experience with international commercial transactions. The Accused also testified that she was informed by her experience at work that payment transfers would usually be accompanied by supporting documentation such as a payment slip.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92">92&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As submitted by the prosecution, an essential aspect of the Accused’s background and experience would be her previous involvement in police investigations in relation to similar transactions linked to Mark. Thus, the contents of P22 and P23, being respectively the statement recorded from the Accused during those investigations and the letter received by her at the conclusion of the same, would serve as objective evidence of the information and knowledge she would have gained from the episode.</a></p><a id="p1_92"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a><a id="p1_93">93&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to P22, it was not disputed that at [Q2], the Accused was shown a bank statement for the DBS Account and her attention was specifically drawn to two transactions set out therein. Further, based on the Accused’s response to this question as well as her testimony in Court, she was cognisant of the fact that the investigations were focused on these two sums of monies which, according to her, were transferred into the DBS Account by persons unknown to her, without her knowledge. The Accused was also told by Insp Rohana that someone had made a complaint about those transfers and that the monies were not supposed to have been sent to her account. The contents of P22 as well as her testimony in Court also indicated that the Accused was aware that Mark had shared the account number of the DBS Account with unknown persons without her prior consent, despite her telling him not to do so.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94">94&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when cross-examined about what she understood when she was asked pointedly in [Q8] of P22, as to whether she was aware that Mark had used her account “to cheat people”, the Accused claimed that she was “shocked” and in a panicked state as it was the first time she had entered a police station for an interview. Thus, the Accused was “not too clear” each time a question was posed to her and this was the case for all ten questions asked of her in P22. The Accused added that she answered the questions as best as she could as she wanted to get the interview over with as soon as possible. When the Accused was asked to point out any inaccuracies in the answers she provided in P22, she reiterated that she did not understand the question in [Q8] but affirmed that the answer she gave was accurate. According to the Accused, the only errors in her answers were those in [A2] stating that she “seldom communicated” with Mark and in [A9] stating that there were a “few occasions” where Mark told her that he needed his friend to transfer cash to her. The Accused explained that in [A9] she was merely referring to the two transactions being investigated. As for [A2], she was referring to the time when she first got to know Mark.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95">95&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to P23, the Accused claimed that she did not read it when she appended her signature on it to acknowledge receipt. She also never read the copy she brought home. The Accused explained that she was made to understand that she was innocent and did not know that the letter was important.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96">96&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having carefully scrutinised the Accused’s evidence regarding her lack of understanding of [Q8] in P22 and ignorance of the contents of P23, I found that these were afterthoughts concocted by her in an attempt to dissociate herself from information indicating that the monies she dealt with in the earlier transactions linked to Mark were tainted by crime.</a></p><a id="p1_96"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a><a id="p1_97">97&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning first to P22, I noted that it was only during cross-examination, and when confronted with [Q8], that the Accused first mentioned that she was so shocked and panicky at the material time that she had difficulty comprehending all the questions asked of her. Having carefully studied the contents of P22, I found that the Accused had responded to the questions relevantly and coherently. On closer scrutiny, it was also clear that the purported “errors” made by the Accused in [A2] and [A9] were in relation to elaborations provided by her, and not in her direct answers to the specific questions asked. Thus, taking the Accused’s evidence at its highest, it could not be disputed that the Accused’s direct answers to all the questions in P22, including her response to [Q8], were correct and accurate. In my view, this indicated that the Accused must have understood all the questions put to her by Insp Rohana when P22 was recorded, including that in [Q8].</a></p><a id="p1_97"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a><a id="p1_98">98&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for P23, I was not persuaded by the Accused’s assertion that she had never read the advisory letter. Firstly, her alleged blasé attitude towards P23 was incongruent with her testimony that she was in a state of shock and panic barely a month ago, when she first attended at the police station to have her statement recorded. Further, as pointed out by the prosecution, despite her claim to have formed the impression that she had “done nothing wrong” and that she was “innocent”, it was not disputed that this was not conveyed to the Accused by Insp Rohana. Instead, Insp Rohana had merely informed the Accused that the police would not be taking any further action against her and asked that she attend at the police station to receive a letter. Given that her previous experience at the police station had left a deep impression on her<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a> and she had to take leave from work to receive the letter from the police, it was inexplicable for the Accused to have, as she claimed, brought the letter home merely to cast it aside without ever reading a word of it.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99">99&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, the Accused’s denial of having read P23 flew in the face of her statement in P5 where she stated categorically, in answer to Question 3, that she did read the advisory letter given to her by the police. When confronted with this by the prosecution, the Accused claimed that she “panicked” when P5 was recorded and, as a result, had “forgotten” that she did not read the letter.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a> Having considered the evidence on this point, I found the Accused’s assertion that she had recalled wrongly to be disingenuous and contrived. It was not disputed that P5 had been read over to the Accused by IO Shen before the Accused signed on page 4 to confirm that it was true and correct. Further, reading the answers provided by the Accused to Questions 2 and 3 concerning her previous involvement in the 2016 investigations, it was clear to me that the Accused had a reasonably vivid and detailed recollection of the earlier investigations. The Accused also confirmed that the rest of the answer she provided to Question 3 was correct.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100">100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the Accused was clearly lying when she testified in Court that she had never read P23. Instead, she was telling the truth when she admitted in P5 that she had read it. I further found that the contents of P23 would have brought the following points to the Accused attention:</a></p><a id="p1_100"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_100"></a><a id="p1_100-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The funds she received in the DBS Account which were the subject matter of the 2016 investigations were “derived from fraud transactions”.</a></p><a id="p1_100-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_100-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_100-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She should “refrain from receiving or dealing with funds from unknown and/or dubious sources”, as doing so might render her “liable to prosecution for offences” under the Penal Code and/or the CDSA.</a></p><a id="p1_100-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_100-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_100-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she were to receive or be asked to receive funds from unknown and/or dubious sources, she was to contact the Commercial Affairs Department.</a></p><a id="p1_100-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_101">101&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having established the Accused’s knowledge and experience in the foregoing, I proceeded to reason (i.e. infer from facts known to the Accused) from that position like an objective reasonable person. Upon doing so, I was of the view that an objective reasonable person in the Accused’s position would have grounds to believe that the amounts set out in the proceeded charges were derived from Mark’s criminal conduct. In particular, I found that there were various suspicious features in the transactions in question that would have sounded alarm bells in a reasonable person with the Accused’s background knowledge and experience. Firstly, Mark had, once again, shared the details of the DBS Account with person(s) unknown to her despite his promise, after she confronted him in 2016, not to allow unknown persons to use her account anymore.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a> Secondly, Mark only informed the Accused after each deposit was made into her account. Not only was this a repeat of what happened during the earlier transactions, given that the deposits this time were, in the main, purportedly payments made by a Bruneian ministry to Mark, it begged the question as to why Mark would have failed to inform the Accused of the payment arrangements. This was especially so when, according to the Accused, Mark had told her that he was expecting payments to the tune of S$600,000 million in total.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> Thirdly, as shall be elaborated on later in these grounds, despite the Accused’s insistence, Mark was unable to produce a shred of documentary support for any of the sums transferred into the Accused’s account. This would have been a red flag for the Accused as, based on her own experience in the course of work, a payment slip would be issued for any transfer of payment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102">102&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pause here to highlight that the case advocated by the defence did not appear to draw a distinction between the subjective and the objective part of the test enunciated in <em>Jeanette Ang.</em> It bears emphasising that while it was necessary to assume the position of the Accused with regards to her knowledge and experience, the second part of the test required the Court to reason as an objective reasonable person and not subjectively as the Accused would have done.</a></p><a id="p1_102"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a><a id="p1_103">103&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, despite the defence’s insistence that the Accused was blinded by her love for Mark and had no reasonable grounds to believe that she was dealing with criminal proceeds, her reaction, upon being informed by Mark that the first sum of money had been deposited in her account, indicated otherwise.</a></p><a id="p1_103"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a><a id="p1_104">104&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on D3, the Accused’s intuitive response was to remark to Mark: “You know rite [<em>sic</em>] I ever been questions [<em>sic</em>] from authority” and to ask him for documents in support of the payment. She added “[b]ut dear please bear in mind I don’t deal with any business if the authority check on me what I am going to reply?”. The Accused also pointed out that “[t]his is not about small money” and insisted that “[t]here must be supporting documents to support“. The Accused even suggested that they wait until Mark settled his problems so that the monies could be transferred into his account.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a> In Court, the Accused denied that she was referring to the 2016 investigations and claimed that by “authority” she was referring to the bank she dealt with in the course of work. The Accused also maintained that she did not suspect anything at all. However, upon further questioning by the prosecution, the Accused conceded that Mark did not know that she was questioned by the bank but was aware that she had been called up by the police in 2016.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> Having carefully considered the evidence in this regard, and, in particular, the context in which the Accused mentioned “authority” in D3, I agreed with the prosecution that the Accused must have been referring to her being questioned by the police during the 2016 investigations. This clearly demonstrated that upon being informed by Mark on 17 July 2018 of the first deposit, the Accused was reminded of the earlier police investigations and had initially insisted that Mark produce supporting documents to verify that she was receiving funds from a legitimate source.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> In my view, this bolstered the prosecution’s case that the Accused did have reasonable grounds to believe that the monies she was dealing with were Mark’s benefits from criminal conduct.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105">105&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, having considered the evidence before the Court and the parties’ submissions, I was satisfied that the prosecution had proven the 1<sup>st</sup> to 7<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup> to 14<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> charges against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt.

However, in view of the relatively lower culpability of the Accused who was not laundering her own ill-gotten gains but what she had reasonable grounds to believe to be another person’s criminal benefits, the prosecution suggested that a suitable discount could be accorded to her to reflect this.</a></p><a id="p1_109"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a><a

corresponding “outflow” when the Accused transferred the funds out of jurisdiction, would form one transaction. As such, the sentences for the charges in relation to the same transaction should run concurrently. However, given the total number of charges and quantum of criminal proceeds involved, the prosecution submitted that the sentences for at least three of the charges involving the highest quanta should run consecutively, resulting in a global sentence of 9 months’ imprisonment.

In particular, the defence referred to [33] of <em>Kalaiarasi</em> which set out the factors that were relevant in the Court determining whether to order an absolute or conditional discharge and urged the Court to grant the Accused a conditional discharge (or impose a nominal fine) based on the following grounds:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_114-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Accused’s “inadvertent” involvement in the offence and her personal mitigating factors;</a></p><a id="p1_114-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_114-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_114-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fact that retribution and general deterrence were not necessary in the present case; and</a></p><a id="p1_114-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_114-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_114-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Accused’s specific circumstances and the circumstances of the offences.</a></p><a id="p1_114-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_115">115&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to the circumstances surrounding the offences, the defence emphasised that the Accused had herself fallen prey to the sophisticated and insidious internet love scam perpetuated by Mark. Being vulnerable after her divorce and hopeful for a better future, she was manipulated by Mark to part with thousands of dollars of her own hard-earned money over the course of their relationship. When she could no longer fund his expenses, she unwittingly became a money mule for him.</a></p><a id="p1_115"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a><a id="p1_116">116&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence submitted that the Accused’s culpability was at the extreme low end of the spectrum. Mark never sought the Accused’s permission to use her account on each occasion and only notified her after the monies were already in her account. To the Accused’s mind, the money which was deposited into her account did not belong to her and it was only natural for her to transfer it out. There was no planning or conniving on her part, the offences were not sophisticated, and her role was extremely limited and short-lived. The Accused also did not receive or seek any reward when she helped Mark transfer the money out of her account.</a></p><a id="p1_116"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a><a id="p1_117">117&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence added that there were exceptional mitigating factors in the present case. The Accused was a first offender and was cooperative during investigations, offering, at the earliest opportunity, to use her own savings to compensate the complainants. The defence urged the Court to exercise judicial mercy in view of her being a single mother to two children and the sole breadwinner. It was a tragedy that her daughter who was studying in the Nanyang Technological University has had to apply for leave of absence from school in anticipation of having to find a job to support the family. The criminal proceedings and the uncertainty of the Accused’s fate had caused the family significant distress and both her children were receiving counselling. They have also penned appeal letters to the Court for leniency to be shown to the Accused. Like the offender in <em>Kalaiarasi</em>, the Accused did not fit the prototype of a serial offender who deliberately broke the law. Her conduct was representative of a hardworking and productive member of society and her involvement in the offences were neither wilful nor blatant.</a></p><a id="p1_117"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a><a id="p1_118">118&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused also suffered from various medical conditions for which she required a cocktail of daily medication and continuing medical treatment. The defence submitted that the brutal reality that she had been made used of and the humiliation from having her relationship with Mark undergo very public scrutiny were enough punishment for her.</a></p><a id="p1_118"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a><a id="p1_119">119&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence submitted that <em>Carole Ng</em> could be distinguished from the present case as the Accused did not open any dedicated bank account for Mark nor provide him with access to the DBS Account. She also genuinely believed that they were in a romantic relationship.</a></p><a id="p1_119"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Prosecution’s reply</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a><a id="p1_120">120&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their oral response to the defence’s submissions, the prosecution noted that cases involving love scams would necessarily involve a victim or accused person who had placed their trust in the scam artist and suffered personal loss while the offence was committed. This was why the prosecution canvassed case precedents involving accused persons who were victims of love scams and who had been previously warned by police but continued to commit the offences. These included the case of <em>Carole Ng</em> and <em>PP v Ng Koon Lay</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24910-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGDC 196</a> (“<em>Ng Koon Lay</em>”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121">121&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prosecution submitted that a conditional discharge should only be ordered in the most exceptional of cases and it was clear that the instant case was not an exceptional one at all. In fact, both general and specific deterrence were engaged as the Accused had received a warning from the police but yet chose to go ahead with the transactions despite the red flags.</a></p><a id="p1_121"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defence’s response</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a><a id="p1_122">122&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence countered that the facts in <em>Carol Ng</em> and <em>Ng Koon Lay</em> could not be correlated to those in the present case. The defence pointed out that the offender in <em>Carol Ng</em> had proactively opened bank accounts and was motivated by her desire to acquire a bag purportedly filled with cash. As for <em>Ng Koon Lay</em>, the offender was receiving cash loans in return for receiving the monies.</a></p><a id="p1_122"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Decision on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Sentencing considerations &amp; principles</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a><a id="p1_123">123&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I begin by addressing the defence’s call for a conditional discharge to be granted to the Accused. Section 8(1) of the Probation of Offenders Act 1951 stated:</a></p><a id="p1_123"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where a court by or before which a person is convicted of an offence (not being an offence the sentence for which is fixed by law) is of the opinion, having regard to the circumstances including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender, that it is inexpedient to inflict punishment and that a probation order is not appropriate, the court may make an order discharging him absolutely, or if the court thinks fit, discharging him subject to the condition that he commits no offence during such period, not exceeding 12 months from the date of the order, as may be specified therein …</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a><a id="p1_124">124&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Kalaiarasi</em>, the High Court set out the factors that the court should consider in deciding whether to order an absolute or conditional discharge under section 8(1) of the POA:</a></p><a id="p1_124"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he overriding considerations for determining whether to order an absolute or conditional discharge are twofold. The court must consider if it is inexpedient to inflict punishment and whether probation is inappropriate. In considering these factors, the court should pay close attention to the <em>nature of the offence</em> and the <em>interests which the offence seeks to protect</em>. In addition, some of the factors that the court should consider include:</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the particular circumstances of the <em>offender</em>: for example, a relatively minor offence committed by an offender with a mental illness might warrant an order for a discharge; it is also relevant to consider the character of the offender;</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the particular circumstances of the <em>offence</em>: for example, the context in which an offence was committed (say, in a situation of an emergency) may suggest a low degree of culpability on the part of the offender; and</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;factors independent of the offender: for example, a delay in the prosecution of an offence, may justify some form of a discharge.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a><a id="p1_125">125&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying the above considerations to the present case, I did not find that this was a case where it was “inexpedient to inflict punishment” on the Accused. Firstly, it could not be disputed that the offences committed by the Accused were serious in nature and such offences were promulgated to combat serious crimes by <em>inter alia</em> deterring the laundering of proceeds of such crimes. Secondly, while the Accused had fallen prey to the love scam and was cheated of her own monies, I agreed with the prosecution that, in the context of offences of this nature, neither the Accused’s personal circumstances nor the particular circumstances of the offences were so exceptional as to warrant a discharge to be granted to her. To the contrary, based on my findings of fact, I agreed with the prosecution that considerations of general and specific deterrence were engaged in this case as the Accused had committed the offences despite having been previously investigated in relation to similar transactions and specifically warned not to be involved in such transactions in future.</a></p><a id="p1_125"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a><a id="p1_126">126&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I shall deal with the defence’s alternative submission for a fine to be meted out. In arguing for a non-custodial sentence, the defence relied largely on the same mitigating factors cited in support of their submission for a conditional discharge. In addition, the defence appealed to the Court to exercise judicial mercy in view of the Accused’s personal and family circumstances. In considering whether the Court should exercise judicial mercy and depart from the sentencing norms in this case, I was guided by the decision of the three-judge coram of the High Court in <em>Chew Soo Shun v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18624-SSP.xml')">[2016] 2 SLR 78</a> (“<em>Chew Soo Shun</em>”). At [38] of <em>Chew Soo Shun</em>, the Court noted that judicial mercy was an exceptional recourse available for truly exceptional cases and which would likely result in an exceptional sentence. Further, where such mercy was exercised, the court would be compelled by humanitarian considerations arising from the exceptional circumstances to order the minimum imprisonment term or a non-custodial sentence where appropriate. Having carefully reviewed the mitigating factors highlighted by the defence, I did not consider the personal and family circumstances of the Accused in this case to be so extenuating as to merit a departure from the sentencing norms for similar offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127">127&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the applicable sentencing framework, I did not agree with the defence’s submission that the sentencing framework in <em>Huang Ying-Chun</em> was applicable in the present case. <em>Huang Ying-Chun</em> was a case involving an offence under section 44(1)(a) of the CDSA. In setting out the sentencing framework therein, the High Court had specified that it <em>only</em> addressed those section 44(1)(a) CDSA offences which featured the following principal factual elements:</a></p><a id="p1_127"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_127"></a><a id="p1_127-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the laundering of cash or monies;</a></p><a id="p1_127-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_127-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_127-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which cash and monies are the proceeds of offences committed in Singapore, and</a></p><a id="p1_127-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_127-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_127-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the involvement of persons falling into the following categories:</a></p><a id="p1_127-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_127-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_127-p2_c-p3_i">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;runners who collect cash in Singapore and dissipate the monies, for example, by remitting the monies or handing them to other persons to remove the monies from the jurisdiction;</a></p><a id="p1_127-p2_c-p3_i"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_127-p2_c-p3_i"></a><a id="p1_127-p2_c-p3_ii">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the persons who recruit these runners; and</a></p><a id="p1_127-p2_c-p3_ii"> </a><p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_127-p2_c-p3_ii"></a><a id="p1_127-p2_c-p3_iii">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the persons managing and/or coordinating these runners.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128">128&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the present case did not involve an offence under section 44(1)(a) of the CDSA and the Accused was not a person falling within the three categories enumerated above, the sentencing framework in <em>Huang Ying-Chun</em> would, strictly speaking, not apply in this case<em>.</em></a></p><a id="p1_128"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a><a id="p1_129">129&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In calibrating sentence, I agreed with the prosecution that reference may be made to the following sentencing bands set out at [71] in <em>Chong Kum Heng</em> for an offence under section 47(1)(c):</a></p><a id="p1_129"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_129"></a><a id="p1_129-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for amounts less than $5000 – three weeks’ imprisonment;</a></p><a id="p1_129-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_129-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_129-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for amounts from $5000 to less than $10,000 – three weeks’ to two months’ imprisonment; and</a></p><a id="p1_129-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_129-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_129-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for amounts from $10,000 to less than $40,000 – two to six months’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_129-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_130">130&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I further agreed with the prosecution’s proposed approach of applying an appropriate discount on the indicative sentences set out in the sentencing bands in <em>Chong Kum Heng</em> on account that Accused, in laundering what she had reason to believe were another person’s benefits from criminal conduct, was relatively less culpable than the offender in <em>Chong Kum Heng</em> who was laundering his own benefits from crime (see also <em>Huang Ying-Chun</em> at [74]). To this end, I was also mindful that in setting out the sentencing bands in <em>Chong Kum Heng</em>, the High Court had taken into account the fact that the monies misappropriated by the offender himself was not recovered.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131">131&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering sentence, I also had regard to the sentencing precedents in <em>Carole Ng</em> and <em>Ng Koon Lay</em>, both of which involved offenders who were themselves victims of internet love scams and who had previously been warned by the police against receiving monies in their accounts from unknown sources.
