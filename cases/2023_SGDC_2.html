To support its goal of having a globally competitive workforce, the Workforce Development Agency (“the WDA”) (now called the Skills Future Singapore Agency) and other statutory boards offer targeted development programs for Singapore's talents.</a></p><a id="p1_1"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Workforce Development Agency (WDA) has several programs to enhance the employability and competitiveness of Singapore's workforce. The Singapore Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) framework is a national credential system that is developed by the WDA and validated by employers, unions, and professional bodies across various industries. The Skills Future Credits Scheme (“SFC Scheme”) encourages individuals to take ownership of their skills development and lifelong learning by providing all Singapore citizens aged 25 and above with an opening credit of $500 in their SFC accounts. Private entities can sign up to be WSQ or non-WSQ training providers under the SFC Scheme, which allows for greater outreach to prospective applicants and provides business opportunities for these private entities.</a></p><a id="p1_2"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government incentive schemes that use public funds are often targets for fraud. In recent years, there has been an increase in the abuse of these schemes, which has led to stricter enforcement and longer approval processes. These offences are serious and must be dealt with harshly because they harm the public good and undermine good governance. The court strongly disapproves of these offences: <em>Public Prosecutor v Koh Seah Wee and another</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present case involved a conspiracy to abuse the SFC Scheme by offering training courses via a prohibited cashback scheme.

Interested applicants were only required to apply to use their Credits to sign up for the courses and were not actually required to attend the courses. In exchange for using their Credits to sign up for the courses, they would receive a cash payment (referred to here as “the Cashback Scheme”). This conduct was a conspiracy to cheat the WDA by inducing them into disbursing the Credits to the training providers. The Accused was accordingly charged for these offences.</a></p><a id="p1_5"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Proceedings</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused claimed trial to 10 charges under section 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.) (“the Penal Code”) for abetment by conspiracy with five others to cheat the WDA. The remaining charges were stood down. On the other hand, the other co-conspirators had pleaded guilty to their respective charges and were called as witnesses for the Prosecution.</a></p><a id="p1_6"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the trial, it became clear that the Accused was a knowing and active participant in the conspiracy to cheat the WDA. He knew that the WDA would not approve of their marketing strategy, which included giving trainees a cashback payment and telling them that attendance was optional. When the WDA later issued a public advisory warning against giving cashback payments and emphasised that attendance was mandatory, the Accused and his co-conspirators discussed ways to hide their conduct from the WDA. The Accused was aware throughout that the WDA would not have disbursed the Credits if they had known about the Cashback Scheme.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accordingly found him guilty of the charges under section 420 read with section 109 of the Penal Code.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being convicted on the proceeded charges, the Accused chose to plead guilty to seven additional charges, including one charge under section 417 read with section 109 of the Penal Code for engaging in a conspiracy to cheat the WDA through the submission of falsified attendance records, one charge under section 204A of the Penal Code for intentionally obstructing the course of justice by throwing away his handphone to destroy evidence, and five charges under section 420 read with section 109 of the Penal Code for engaging in a conspiracy to cheat SPRING Singapore (“SPRING”).</a></p><a id="p1_9"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused was sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 23 months’ and 50 weeks’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Undisputed Facts</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We begin with the undisputed facts.</a></p><a id="p1_11"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.I.

The trainee must then select their enrolled course from a drop-down menu and enter the fees payable, including GST. This amount must be less than or equal to the approved course fee per trainee provided by the training provider to the WDA. The trainee must then specify the amount of SFC they wished to claim, within the limit of their available credit balance. The trainee must also choose whether the SFC should be paid to the training provider or their own bank account. If the claim was submitted before the course start date, they could choose either option, but if it was submitted after the start date, the SFC could only be paid to their own bank account. If the trainee chose to have the SFC paid to the training provider, they were required to provide supporting documents showing their registration or payment for the course. Before submitting the claim, the trainee must confirm that they have read the Trainee T&amp;Cs, which are available on the SkillsFuture portal where the claim would be made.</a></p><a id="p1_37"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW2 Officer Goh testified that once a claim was submitted, it would be processed by the WDA's automated system. This process would usually take a few seconds, but some claims that fail initial checks would be sent to a human officer for further verification. Some claims would also be randomly selected for human verification. If irregularities were found, an investigation would be launched and disbursements would be halted. Otherwise, the disbursement would be approved and sent to the bank for GIRO payment. If the trainee had chosen to have the Credits paid to the training provider, they would receive an email or SMS three days before the course start date reminding them of their claim submission and instructing them to cancel and resubmit the claim if the course date had changed. According to Officer Goh, other reasons for cancelling a claim submission included the trainee's intention not to attend the course and the training provider's failure to adhere to WDA’s terms and conditions. In these cases, the WDA would take steps to prevent the disbursement of the Credits.</a></p><a id="p1_38"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to the terms and conditions binding the training providers, PW2 Officer Goh testified that the training providers were required to agree to the WDA’s “Funded Course Specific Terms and Conditions” (“Specific T&amp;Cs”)<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a> and “Additional Terms and Conditions for Skillsfuture Credit Eligible Courses” (“Additional T&amp;Cs”),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> both of which were publicly available on the SkillsConnect website. He testified that the Specific T&amp;Cs were first published on 19 September 2015 and were in force in April 2016. Clause 4.9 of the Specific T&amp;Cs stated:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall not engage in marketing practices (which include without limitation the granting of rebates, discounts, free gifts, and a charging of differential course fees) which have the result of subjecting persons who are eligible for higher rates of award under the Grant(s) to larger payments than persons who are eligible for lower rates of award under the Grant(s) or who are not eligible for WDA funding at all.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW2 Officer Goh testified that the purpose of Clause 4.9 of the Specific T&amp;Cs was to ensure that the net course fees payable by a potential trainee accurately reflected the grants provided by the WDA for a specific training course. He also referred to Clause 4.5 of the Additional T&amp;Cs, which stated:</a></p><a id="p1_40"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Training Provider shall not:-</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pay an Applicant any monies on account of any Qualifying Fees it received from WDA pursuant to any application for use of SkillsFuture Credit submitted by the Applicant; or</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enter into any agreement with the Applicant for such payment.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a><a id="p1_41">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW2 Officer Goh added that the purpose of Clause 4.5 of the Additional T&amp;Cs was to ensure that the SFC Scheme operated as a credit scheme for training purposes. In explaining the concept of a “credit” scheme, he clarified that the Credits were to be used for a very specific purpose, that is to offset course fees that the trainees had to pay for courses approved by the WDA. Essentially, the policy intent of the SFC Scheme was to defray out-of-pocket training course fees. The payment of monies to a trainee on the basis of a successful SFC claim would therefore go against the policy intent of the SFC Scheme as it was tantamount to allowing the trainee to encash his Credits. He further added – during his Cross-Examination – that Clause 7 of the Trainee T&amp;Cs alluded to the fact that attendance at the courses was compulsory:<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are responsible for applying and cancelling your Application before the start date of your course.

Their suspicions regarding the Business Model ultimately stemmed from an appreciation that the Cashback Scheme was disallowed, or at the very least, not approved by the WDA.</a></p><a id="p1_231"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_231"></a><a id="p1_232">232&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most importantly, the Accused's evidence showed that he was clearly aware that the cashback scheme was impermissible. During his examination-in-chief, he testified that he feared that the WDA would have amended their terms and conditions or "shut down" the courses offered by AI and Alliance if it had found out about the scheme (see [193] above). In other words, he understood that the WDA would not have approved of the Business Model and would have taken action if it had learned of it.</a></p><a id="p1_232"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_232"></a><a id="p1_233">233&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The irrefutable conclusion was therefore that the Key Conspirators and the Sales Team had known the Cashback Scheme to be impermissible to the WDA.</a></p><a id="p1_233"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Key Conspirators and the Sales Team knew that the Cashback Scheme was concealed from the WDA </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_233"></a><a id="p1_234">234&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Key Conspirators and Sales Team were also aware at all material times that, in light of the impermissibility of the Cashback Scheme, it was to be concealed from the WDA and was in fact so concealed. Sean admitted to knowing that the Cashback Scheme was meant to be “<em>a private arrangement</em>” between the trainee and the salespersons (see [88] above), whereas Allister candidly gave evidence on the various strategies used to drape a veneer of legitimacy over the Cashback Scheme, which included limiting the number of sign-ups per week, imposing an age limit on the trainees, matching the location to the number of procured sign-ups and coaching the trainees to deflect the WDA’s queries (see [66]-[72] above).</a></p><a id="p1_234"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_234"></a><a id="p1_235">235&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused was aware of the abovementioned strategies and had in fact initiated adopting the Survey Method (see [192(a)] above) to further strengthen the façade they had wished to construct. I did not accept the Accused’s claim that the Survey Method was an innocuous marketing gimmick; he had – by his own admission – intended to use the Survey Method to conceal the Cashback Scheme from the WDA, after having come across Hisham’s very “<em>obvious</em>” advertisement on Facebook.</a></p><a id="p1_235"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_235"></a><a id="p1_236">236&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Lim Biao understood that the purpose of the abovementioned strategies was to prevent the WDA from finding out about their Business Model (see [128] above). The Sales Team were likewise privy to the Key Conspirators’ efforts in concealing the true state of affairs from the WDA (see [101(a)], [143(b)] and [155(a)] above).</a></p><a id="p1_236"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_236"></a><a id="p1_237">237&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The common knowledge of the Key Conspirators and the Sales Team pertaining to the above matters was sufficient to amount to a conspiracy to cheat the WDA. They were all alive to the fact that the WDA would have taken issue with the Business Model had it learnt of it, but that the WDA was otherwise in the dark due to the Business Model being kept under wraps. In other words, they had knowing and voluntary participation in this plot to earn profit from the SFC Scheme. It was not necessary for them to have been equally informed as to all the details of the plot as long as they had been aware of its general purpose. It was therefore irrelevant that the Accused had never met or spoken with Sean as at the dates of the offences (the earliest being on 11 April 2016), as the essence of their conspiracy had already crystallised by then.</a></p><a id="p1_237"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_237"></a><a id="p1_238">238&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the foregoing, I found that the Accused had engaged in a conspiracy with Allister, Lim Biao and Sean (and Gabriel and Nicholas/Hisham for the relevant charges) to cheat the WDA.</a></p><a id="p1_238"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Cashback Scheme had been put in place in pursuance of the conspiracy to cheat the WDA</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_238"></a><a id="p1_239">239&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proceeded Charges were in relation to courses sold by Lim Biao, Nicholas and Hisham (see [24] above). Their respective testimonies provided clear evidence that they had, in pursuance of the conspiracy to cheat the WDA, marketed the Courses to the Trainees via the Cashback Scheme and had facilitated their SFC claim submissions on the SFC Portal.</a></p><a id="p1_239"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_239"></a><a id="p1_240">240&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> charges, Lim Biao gave evidence on the same approach he had taken in selling the courses to PW4 Chen, PW5 Ong and PW6 Wu (see [122] above). He first offered them cashback in exchange for the use of their Credits to sign up for the courses. He also informed them that attendance at the courses was optional but that their Credits would still be forfeited if they did not attend. Upon their agreement, he then guided them on the claim submission process via the SFC Portal. After the successful submission of a claim on the SFC Portal, he gave them a sum of cashback. Lim Biao recalled giving a cashback of $200 (being $100 per course) whereas PW4 Chen, PW5 Ong and PW6 Wu testified to receiving a total of $200, $150 and $100 respectively (see above at [44(d)]). Although the evidence differed on the actual quantum, the ultimate consensus was that a sum of cashback had been offered, given and received in relation to the drawdown of PW4 Chen, PW5 Ong and PW6 Wu’s Credits.</a></p><a id="p1_240"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_240"></a><a id="p1_241">241&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to the 73<sup>rd</sup> and 74<sup>th</sup> charges, PW3 Low gave evidence regarding Nicholas’ facilitation of his claim on the SFC Portal (see [44] above). He had first been contacted by Nicholas after having indicated his interest to apply for the courses in exchange for cashback. He then gave his SingPass login details and other personal information to Nicholas for the purposes of signing up for two courses on the SFC Portal. He later received $100 via bank transfer as his cashback. PW3 Low’s account of the events accorded with Nicholas’ account of how he had generally facilitated the trainee’s sign-ups (see above at [151]).</a></p><a id="p1_241"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_241"></a><a id="p1_242">242&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to the 103<sup>rd</sup> and 104<sup>th</sup> charges, Hisham testified that he had offered his close friend, PW7 Quah, a sum of cashback in exchange for the drawdown of his Credits to apply for the courses “Professional Selling” and “Excel 101 – Mastering the Fundamentals” (see [96] above) and had further informed that PW7 Quah would still be able to receive cashback even without attending the course. PW7 Quah had then logged onto the SFC Portal to let Hisham do up the application on his behalf and later received $100 cashback from Hisham (see [44] above).</a></p><a id="p1_242"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_242"></a><a id="p1_243">243&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the evidence, I was satisfied that the key features of the business model were offering cashback to prospective trainees in exchange for drawing down their credits and encouraging them to sign up for the courses by emphasising that attendance was optional. I therefore found that the cashback scheme had been implemented as part of the conspiracy by the Key Conspirators and the Sales Team to cheat the WDA.</a></p><a id="p1_243"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Cashback Scheme was put in place with a dishonest or fraudulent intention</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_243"></a><a id="p1_244">244&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As earlier found (in [232] above), the Accused understood that the WDA would not have disbursed the Credits had it been privy to the Cashback Scheme. This was closely related to – but ultimately a separate inquiry from – the question of whether the Accused had participated in the Cashback Scheme with a dishonest or fraudulent intention. I noted from the Trial Charges that the Prosecution had founded its case based on the Accused’s <em>dishonest</em> intention (see [25] above)<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_804" id="Ftn_804_1"><sup>[note: 804]</sup></a> – i.e., that he had intended to cause wrongful gain to one person or wrongful loss to another person. As stated in <em>Er Joo Nguang</em>, such dishonest intention cannot be directly proved and has to be inferred from the Accused’s conduct and also from the surrounding circumstances. There were therefore two pertinent issues: (i) whether the Accused <em>knew</em> the gain or loss was wrongful; and (ii) whether the Accused <em>intended</em> to cause the wrongful gain or loss. I analysed the evidence before me accordingly.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the Accused knew the gain or loss was wrongful</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_245">245&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As canvassed at [196] above, the Accused was aware that the WDA would have refused to disburse the Credits had it learnt of the Cashback Scheme. Accordingly, the Accused would have known that the Credits received by AI and Alliance had been wrongfully disbursed, thereby causing wrongful loss to the WDA and wrongful gain to AI and Alliance.</a></p><a id="p1_245"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_245"></a><a id="p1_246">246&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the material time of the offences, the Accused knew that the WDA had not meant for the SFC Scheme to give “<em>hard cash</em>” to its trainees (see [173] above). This was conceded in the Defence’s Closing Submissions.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_805" id="Ftn_805_1"><sup>[note: 805]</sup></a> The Accused had a good understanding that the SFC scheme was intended to provide eligible trainees with the opportunity to improve their skills through subsidised courses (see [162] above). He knew therefore that by offering optional attendance and a cashback to prospective trainees, the trainees would be drawing down on their Credits for the wrong purpose. I found that this understanding was sufficient for the Accused to have known that the disbursement of the Credits by the WDA (pursuant to the Cashback Scheme) was wrongful.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_247">247&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused’s main defence was that he had not thought the disbursement to be wrongful, as he had relied on Allister’s representations that the Business Model/Cashback Scheme was legal. I did not accept his argument for two reasons.</a></p><a id="p1_247"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_247"></a><a id="p1_248">248&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Defence had not led any evidence – save for the Accused’s bare assertions – of Allister’s representations that the Cashback Scheme was not illegal. Insofar as Allister had confirmed that he had <em>not told</em> the Accused that there was anything wrong with the Cashback Scheme, ultimately, no evidence was led on whether Allister had <em>expressly told</em> the Accused that the Cashback Scheme was legal. This was the purported representation that the Accused had relied upon, which should have been primarily established. I also noted that the Accused had not also, when giving his statement to the CAD, made any mention of Allister’s representations or his reliance on them.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_806" id="Ftn_806_1"><sup>[note: 806]</sup></a> This suggested that Allister had not in fact made such representations and that these were mere afterthoughts conjured by the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_249">249&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, even if Allister had indeed made such representations, I did not believe that the Accused – who had shown himself to be a bright and quick-witted person – had believed Allister’s words. The Accused evidently had a clear picture of what was going on as one of the major players in this scheme. If the Accused had truly believed that the WDA allowed attendance to be optional, and that there was nothing wrong with the giving of cashback, he would not have had any reason to conceal the Business Model/Cashback Scheme from the WDA. In relation to this, I also made the following observations:</a></p><a id="p1_249"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_249"></a><a id="p1_249-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused’s apparent reason for concealing the Business Model/Cashback Scheme from the WDA was to prevent them from learning about their “<em>unfair advantage</em>” over their business competitors. He claimed that he had feared the WDA would change their terms and conditions to preclude their Business Model. However, this fear directly contradicted his supposed impression that the Business Model was perfectly legitimate – indeed, such an apprehension would only have been had by someone who knew in fact that the WDA disapproved of the Business Model.</a></p><a id="p1_249-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_249-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_249-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused’s characterisation of the Business Model as having an “unfair advantage” was an attempt at camouflaging what was really a loophole in the SFC Scheme that he knew was unlawful to exploit. As the Accused had himself conceded, there was nothing wrong with competition (see [193] above). Ergo, the reason for concealing the Business Model from the WDA must have had been something beyond any legitimate competitive edge that they had. The Accused’s efforts in concocting a multi-dimensional Survey Method to keep the Business Model out of the public eye was testament to his appreciation that there was something sinister underlying the supposed “competitive advantage” – that is, that the Business Model was illegal and would cause wrongful loss to the WDA.</a></p><a id="p1_249-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_249-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_249-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, it was irrelevant what the Accused thought the consequences of implementing the Business Model were. It was sufficient that the Accused had intended to implement the Business Model in a manner that caused wrongful loss to the WDA. It did not matter whether the Accused knew the consequences of being exposed was operational (being “shut down” by the WDA) or penal (being charged with the present offences), as that went to his knowledge of the law. It is trite that ignorance of the law is no defence.</a></p><a id="p1_249-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_249-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_250">250&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the above, I found that the Accused had known that wrongful loss would be occasioned to the WDA by reason of offering cashback and optional attendance to prospective trainees. There was ample evidence of his efforts to conceal the Business Model from the WDA which supported the finding of his tainted knowledge.</a></p><a id="p1_250"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the Accused intended to cause the wrongful gain or loss</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_250"></a><a id="p1_251">251&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from knowing that there would be wrongful loss occasioned to the WDA, the evidence showed that the Accused had <em>intended</em> to cause such wrongful loss. As the Defence correctly pointed out, a finding of intention requires not only knowledge that a particular consequence is likely to occur, but also that the actor is motivated by the goal of achieving that consequence: <em>Muhammad Khalis bin Ramlee v Public Prosecutor<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></em></a><em><a href="#Ftn_807" id="Ftn_807_1"><sup>[note: 807]</sup></a></em> at [37(a)].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_808" id="Ftn_808_1"><sup>[note: 808]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_252">252&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, the Accused was clearly motivated by the prospect of financial gain and therefore sought to secure and maintain the WDA's continued disbursement of the credits. He testified that he saw a good "business opportunity" when he learned of the SFC scheme and AI and Alliance's course offerings and took it upon himself to negotiate with Allister for a higher commission. He presented the Business Model as a scheme to get rich in order to persuade Gabriel to sell the courses. While the Cashback Scheme was in operation, the Accused regularly told Allister that he was confident of securing up to 1,000 weekly sign-ups and constantly urged him to increase the number of weekly slots to bring in more sales. He also enticed the salespeople by promising that they could earn five-figure sums from their commissions (see [138] above).</a></p><a id="p1_252"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_252"></a><a id="p1_253">253&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence did not seem to challenge the fact that the Accused was motivated by financial gain, except to argue that there is nothing wrong with businessmen being motivated by profits. I did not think this argument was relevant to the current inquiry, which is focused solely on whether the Accused was motivated or driven by financial gain, not on whether that motivation was justified or not.</a></p><a id="p1_253"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_253"></a><a id="p1_254">254&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, I found that the Accused had intended to cause wrongful loss to the WDA as he was actuated by the objective of earning profit through the Business Model (which he knew would cause wrongful loss to the WDA).</a></p><a id="p1_254"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the WDA was deceived and induced to disburse the Credits </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_254"></a><a id="p1_255">255&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was undisputed that the WDA was unaware of the Cashback Scheme offered by AI/Alliance or their Business Model at the material time of the offences. The issue therefore was whether the WDA, in the absence of such knowledge, was deceived and induced to disburse the Credits to AI and Alliance. The Prosecution called PW2 Officer Goh to testify in this regard.</a></p><a id="p1_255"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_255"></a><a id="p1_256">256&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence raised the preliminary issue of whether PW2 Officer Goh was an appropriate witness to give evidence on the WDA’s policies at the time of the offences – and argued that he was <em>not</em> an appropriate witness as he was merely involved in designing and supporting systems under the SFC Scheme. It also argued that his evidence should be disregarded as he was an evasive witness who was overzealous in giving evidence. In response, the Prosecution submitted that PW2 Officer Goh’s job scope allowed him to be privy to the policy intent underlying the SFC Scheme and that this was apparent through his ability, while on the stand, to explain the relevant clauses in the terms and conditions. The Prosecution also described him as a forthright and knowledgeable witness with no reason to lie. I agreed with the Prosecution that there was no indication before me that PW2 Officer Goh was unequipped to give evidence about the WDA’s policy intent at the time of the offences. I was also conscious of the fact that the Defence had at no point in time put to him that he was unequipped to give evidence or that he was being untruthful. When PW2 Officer Goh clarified during his Cross-Examination that he had also had a hand in drafting the terms and conditions of the WDA, the Defence did not appear to dispute this. In the circumstances I was of the view that PW2 Officer Goh was an appropriate person to give evidence regarding the WDA’s policy intent behind the SFC Scheme.</a></p><a id="p1_256"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_256"></a><a id="p1_257">257&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was patently clear from PW2 Officer Goh’s evidence that the WDA would not have disbursed the Credits had it known about the Cashback Scheme. According to PW2 Officer Goh, the SFC Scheme operated as a credit scheme for training purposes and its policy intent was purely to defray out-of-pocket training course fees incurred by the trainee. The terms and conditions that PW2 Officer Goh had referred to in his evidence were relevant in this determination (see above at [39]-[41]).</a></p><a id="p1_257"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_257"></a><a id="p1_258">258&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Clause 7 of the Trainee T&amp;Cs did not explicitly state that attendance was compulsory, I accepted that this was an implicit understanding. I did not accept the Defence’s argument that subsequent changes to the terms and conditions showed that the version in force at the time of the offences did not make attendance a condition for drawing down the credits. In my view, clause 7 anticipated situations where the course was cancelled by the training provider or where the trainee withdrew from the course. In either case, the common factor was that the trainee would not attend the course. The WDA's requirement that the trainee cancel their application in such situations indicated that it considered attendance to be a prerequisite for the disbursement of the credits. While I agreed with the Defence that the decision to attend the courses ultimately rested with the trainees, this did not change the fact that the business model relied heavily on the prospect of optional attendance as one of its key features of the Business Model (in addition to the offer of free cash). The Accused admitted that he was not surprised that the attendance rates were low because it was "<em>commonsensical</em>" given that the trainees had been told that attendance was optional (see above at [201]).</a></p><a id="p1_258"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_258"></a><a id="p1_259">259&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agreed that Clause 4.5 of the Additional T&amp;Cs showed the WDA’s stance against the giving of cashback. The act of giving cashback was specifically envisioned in Clause 4.5 which prohibited the payment of “<em>any monies on account of any Qualifying Fees it received from WDA pursuant to any application for use of SkillsFuture Credit by the [trainee]</em>” or any agreement for such payment. I accepted PW2 Officer Goh’s explanation of Clause 4.5 that it was against the WDA’s policy intent for the trainees to encash their Credits. As the Cashback Scheme offered by the AI/Alliance/CGM clearly entailed such encashment, clearly, it would have been denounced by the WDA. I did not agree with the Defence’s argument that only payments made out of the funds received from the WDA would run foul of Clause 4.5.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_809" id="Ftn_809_1"><sup>[note: 809]</sup></a> It argued that since the payment of cashback to the Trainees was made <em>before</em> the WDA had disbursed the Credits in relation to the Trainees’ respective applications, the payment could not be said to have been made out of the funds received from the WDA and Clause 4.5 had not been breached. In my view, the Defence was splitting hairs. Insofar as the salespersons might have given the cashback ahead of receiving their commission, this was no more than an act of convenience (see [152]) and did not undermine that the fact that the cashback was still traceable to the commissions and in turn the disbursement of the Credits by the WDA. The Accused’s evidence – which was supported by the other Key Conspirators and the Sales Team – was that CGM would only have paid out the commissions to the salespersons if a valid Claim ID was given. This showed the inextricable link between the disbursement of the Credits and the payment of the commission to the salespersons (from which the cashback would be given to the trainees).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_260">260&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the arguments above, the Defence, in its Closing Submissions and Reply Submissions, also made several arguments in relation to the WDA’s terms and conditions. These arguments broadly went towards two issues: (1) whether the Accused knew or would have known from a reading of the terms and conditions that the WDA prohibited the giving of cashback; and (2) whether the terms and conditions supported a finding that the WDA prohibited the giving of cashback. I will not deal with the arguments in the first category as I have already made a finding on the Accused’s state of mind at the material time of the offences (see [246]-[250] above). For completeness however I shall deal with the second category of arguments. In particular, the Defence made the following arguments:</a></p><a id="p1_260"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_260"></a><a id="p1_260-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused had not breached any terms and conditions as there were no terms and conditions binding marketing agents;</a></p><a id="p1_260-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_260-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_260-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms and conditions only prohibited direct payments by the WDA to the trainees; and</a></p><a id="p1_260-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_260-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_260-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, Clause 6 of the Trainee T&amp;Cs in fact allowed for cashback to be given.</a></p><a id="p1_260-p2_c"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Defence’s Argument #1: There were no terms and conditions binding marketing agents</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_260-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_261">261&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence argued that the Prosecution had not adduced any evidence of any terms and conditions in force at the material time of the offences that bound a marketing agent vis-à-vis the WDA. I did not think this to be relevant. The present case, being criminal in nature, was not directly concerned with whether there was any actionable breach of the terms and conditions set out by the WDA. Rather, these terms and conditions were merely devices for the Court to consider in ascertaining the WDA’s stance towards the Cashback Scheme. It therefore did not matter that there were no terms and conditions binding the marketing agents such as the Accused. The available terms and conditions at the time of the offences (i.e. the Trainee T&amp;Cs, the Specific T&amp;Cs and the Addition T&amp;Cs) were sufficient for the Court to make its finding on the same.</a></p><a id="p1_261"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Defence’s Argument #2: The terms and conditions only prohibited direct payments from the WDA to the trainees</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_261"></a><a id="p1_262">262&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence also argued that the terms and conditions only prohibited direct payments by the WDA to the trainees, and that the Prosecution therefore bore the burden of showing that the act of giving cashback <em>by marketing agents</em> was forbidden.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_810" id="Ftn_810_1"><sup>[note: 810]</sup></a> I found this argument to be illogical. If the WDA had not approved of the giving of free cash to the trainees, it would not have allowed the payment of its disbursed Credits to the trainees in the form of a cashback, regardless of the number of intermediate transactions involved. Therefore, I do not agree that the Prosecution must demonstrate that the specific act of providing cashback by the Sales Teams or marketing agents was prohibited. It was sufficient for the Prosecution to show that the WDA had forbidden the trainees to convert their Credits into cash, which, based on the evidence presented to me, has been proven.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Defence’s Argument #3: Clause 6 of the Trainee T&amp;Cs in fact allowed for cashback to be given</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_263">263&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another of the Defence’s argument focussed on Clause 6 of the Trainee T&amp;Cs:</a></p><a id="p1_263"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">You are not allowed to receive monies in excess of the amounts of credits that you have applied to use, and you are required to repay WDA any excess amount that is not due to you.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_263"></a><a id="p1_264">264&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence’s interpretation of Clause 6 was that it actually explicitly allowed for cashback to be given, and that it simply needed to be accounted for through repayment from the trainee to the WDA. This convoluted argument ignored the obvious fact that Clause 6 was merely anticipating the retrospective recovery of any cashback that was otherwise prohibited by the other terms and conditions of the WDA (such as Clause 4.5 of the Additional T&amp;Cs). In the Defence's own words, the purpose of Clause 6 was to "disgorge" the cashback received by the trainee. Such disgorgement would not be necessary if the WDA allowed the giving of cashback in the first place, and there should be no expectation that the WDA would effect any form of recovery, whether from the training providers or the trainees. The Defence's reference to Clause 6 of the Trainee T&amp;Cs actually supported the Prosecution's submission that cashback was not allowed, to the extent that the WDA would have recovered the sum.</a></p><a id="p1_264"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_264"></a><a id="p1_265">265&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the above, I found that the WDA was deceived and was induced to disburse the Credits to AI and Alliance when it otherwise would not have done so.</a></p><a id="p1_265"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summary of Key Findings</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_265"></a><a id="p1_266">266&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I summarise my key findings as follows. The Accused had abetted by engaging with the Key Conspirators and the Sales Team (as the case may be) in a conspiracy to cheat the WDA. Their common design was to profit from the Credits disbursed by the WDA and in pursuance of this design, the Accused assumed the role of a marketing agent for the courses offered by AI and Alliance. He trained and instructed his salespersons to offer cashback to prospective trainees while at the same time informing them that attendance was optional. This attracted many applicants – including PW3 Low, PW4 Chen, PW5 Ong, PW6 Wu and PW7 Quah – to draw down on their Credits in exchange for cold hard cash with minimal to no commitment. The myriad of strategies adopted by the Accused and Allister, especially the Survey Method, was clear evidence that he knew the Cashback Scheme was impermissible and had to be concealed from the WDA. Despite knowing this, he not only persisted with the marketing of the Courses but constantly sought to further expand the sales. Despite this knowledge, he not only continued to market the courses but constantly tried to expand sales further. He was motivated by the prospect of financial gain from the WDA. The WDA, unaware of the Cashback Scheme due to the Accused's successful efforts in hiding it from them, was deceived into disbursing Credits to AI and Alliance when it otherwise would not have done so if it had learnt of their business model. I therefore found the Accused guilty and convicted him of the Trial Charges.</a></p><a id="p1_266"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">PLEAD-GUILTY CHARGES</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_266"></a><a id="p1_267">267&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the Accused’s conviction on the Trial Charges, he opted to plead guilty to seven other charges, namely five charges under section 420 read with section 109 of the Penal Code for engaging in a conspiracy to cheat SPRING (“the SPRING Charges”), one charge under section 417 read with section 109 of the Penal Code for engaging in a conspiracy to cheat the WDA through the submission of falsified attendance records, and one charge under section 204A of the Penal Code for intentionally obstructing the course of justice by throwing away his handphone to destroy evidence (collectively, “the PG Charges”).

id="p1_291">291&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crux of the Trial Charges was that they involved the defrauding of a public institution, which called for a harsh sentence to signal the Court’s

At the same time, I took note of the three months’ imprisonment imposed on Allister, Sean and Lim Biao (the Key Conspirators) and applied a slight uplift as the Accused, having claimed trial, was not entitled to a sentencing discount. The uplift was also necessary as the Accused, unlike the other Key Conspirators, had retained the full profit of his wrongdoing. Allister and Sean had both made restitution of $7650 and $34,250 respectively. While Lim Biao had not made any voluntary restitution, profits amounting to $3060 were disgorged. I did not think it was relevant that the Accused had spent his earnings on paying the salespersons their commissions (after the WDA withheld the disbursements of the Credits). The Accused had profited the moment he gained control of the monies and it did not matter <em>how</em> or <em>to what</em> he applied the funds. The fact that he was now “out of pocket” was no more than a personal circumstance describing his inability to make any restitution – which was irrelevant for the purpose of sentencing – and did not negate the fact that the Accused had made a personal gain from the offences.</a></p><a id="p1_294"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_294"></a><a id="p1_295">295&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noted that the Defence’s main argument was that the Accused was not the mastermind behind the operation, but rather Allister was. This argument ignored the fact that there were <em>several</em> masterminds, i.e. the Key Conspirators, and it could not be denied that the Accused was in fact one of the main protagonists in this operation. While the salespeople may have had the impression that the Accused was the "sole" boss of CGM due to his visibility to them, this did not change the fact that he was so visible because he was constantly instructing the salespeople on their new strategies and how to train the new recruits. In other words, the Accused's visibility to the salespeople was increased precisely because he played a significant role in devising and communicating his deceitful plans to them.</a></p><a id="p1_295"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_295"></a><a id="p1_296">296&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having considered the circumstances of the case, I sentenced the Accused to <b>four months’ imprisonment per Trial Charge</b>.</a></p><a id="p1_296"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_296"></a><a id="p1_297">297&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noticed that for Allister and Sean, the sentences for six out of the 18 proceeded charges were ordered to be served consecutively, which is one third of the charges. However, for Lim Biao, only three out of the 18 charges were ordered to be served consecutively, which is one sixth of the charges. Based on this observation, I did not agree with the Prosecution's submission that the sentences for five out of the ten Trial Charges should be served consecutively. Instead, I ordered that the sentences for four charges should be served consecutively for the sake of parity.</a></p><a id="p1_297"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Sentencing for the PG Charges</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_297"></a><a id="p1_298">298&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining the sentences for the PG charges, I considered the fact that the Accused only pleaded guilty at the end of the trial when faced with overwhelming evidence of his guilt. Therefore, although he pleaded guilty to the PG charges, he should not expect to receive the same sentence reduction that is typically given to an offender who pleads guilty at the first opportunity. However, when compared to the sentences imposed on Allister, Lim Biao, and Sean (the Key Conspirators), I did not feel the need to significantly increase the sentence as I accepted that the Accused could have also chosen to go to trial and force the Prosecution to prove its case against him.</a></p><a id="p1_298"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_298"></a><a id="p1_299">299&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the section 417 Penal Code offence involving the falsification of attendance records, I regarded the Accused, Allister, Lim Biao and Sean as having been equally complicit. The Prosecution’s indicative sentence of five months’ imprisonment was a 25% increase from that imposed on Allister, Lim Biao and Sean – which I did not think justified in the circumstances. I therefore gave a smaller uplift and imposed a sentence of <b>four months’ and two weeks’ imprisonment</b>. I ordered <b>the sentence to run consecutively</b>.</a></p><a id="p1_299"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_299"></a><a id="p1_300">300&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the offence under section 204A of the Penal Code, I noted that although the Accused, Allister, Lim Biao, and Sean had all committed the same offence, the Accused took his act of obstructing justice to a greater extent. After reviewing the PG papers for Allister, Lim Biao, and Sean, which were presented as evidence at the main trial, I saw that Allister and Sean only deleted their WhatsApp chat records with each other, while Lim Biao deleted the entire WhatsApp application from his phone. However, the Accused went further by throwing away his mobile phone entirely. I agreed with the Prosecution that this made it difficult for law enforcement to determine the extent of the Accused's involvement, and this difficulty was even greater when the Accused decided to claim trial. In the circumstances, I found that a <b>sentence of three months’ imprisonment</b> was justified. I ordered <b>the sentence to run consecutively</b>.</a></p><a id="p1_300"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_300"></a><a id="p1_301">301&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the SPRING Charges, parties were agreeable to a sentence of <b>24 weeks’ imprisonment per charge</b> with <b>two sentences running consecutively</b>.

For the avoidance of doubt, I did not think this to be a crushing sentence. Although the Accused did not have any antecedents, he could not be said to be a first-time offender and I found the aggregate sentence to be in keeping with his past record and future prospects. I would like to conclude by saying that during these proceedings, the Accused demonstrated himself to be a bright and astute businessman. It is truly unfortunate and regrettable that he used his intelligence in the wrong manner. I hope that this period of incarceration will give him time to reflect on his mistakes and return to society as a useful person, as the other conspirators have done.</a></p><a id="p1_302"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_302"></a><a id="">_______________________________</a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id=""> <b>ANNEX 1 – STATEMENT OF FACTS FOR PG</b> </a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id=""></a></p><div align="center"><a id=""> <b><u>IN THE STATE COURTS OF THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE</u></b> </a></div><p></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id=""></a></p><div align="center"><a id=""> <b>PUBLIC PROSECUTOR</b> </a></div><p></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id=""></a></p><div align="center"><a id=""> <b>v</b> </a></div><p></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id=""></a></p><div align="center"><a id=""> <b>JOSHUA TAN JUN LIANG</b> </a></div><p></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id=""> <b>________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</b> </a></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id=""></a></p><div align="center"><a id=""> <b>STATEMENT OF FACTS</b> </a></div><p></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id=""></a></p><div align="center"><a id=""> <b>DAC- 911570-2018 &amp; ORS</b> </a></div><p></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id=""></a></p><div align="center"><a id=""> <b>(incorporating 7 proceeded charges)</b> </a></div><p></p><a id=""> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id=""> <b>_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</b> </a></p><a id=""> <p class="Judg-Heading-1"> <u>FACTS RELATING TO THE PROCEEDED CHARGE UNDER SECTION 417 PENAL CODE: DAC- 911570-2018</u> </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_1_1">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused is Joshua Tan Jun Liang (male, 31 years old, NRIC No. XXX)(“<b>Joshua</b>”).</a></p><a id="p1_1_1"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1_1"></a><a id="p1_2_2">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The co-accused persons are:</a></p><a id="p1_2_2"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2_2"></a><a id="p1_2-p2_a">a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tay Sheng Yang (male, 31 years old, NRIC No. XXX).
