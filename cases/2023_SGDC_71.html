These five charges against Jason were framed similarly as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_5"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“You, Jason Sim Chon Ang, are charged that you, in Singapore, being a director of Jason Parquet Specialist (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“JPS”), did cheat [<em>name of bank</em>] by deceiving the bank into believing that [<em>description of the quantity, type and dimensions of the wood</em>] were sold and delivered to JPS by Tati Trading Pte Ltd on [<em>date of sale and delivery on invoice and delivery order</em>] in relation to an invoice and delivery order bearing reference number [<em>number on the invoice and delivery order</em>], when it was not so, and by such manner of deception, dishonestly induced [<em>name of bank</em>] to deliver a sum of [<em>dollar amount</em>] to Tati Trading Pte Ltd on [<em>date of bank transfer of the funds</em>], which the bank would not have done if it was not so deceived, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 420 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Revised Edition).”</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As against Tjioe, the Prosecution framed five corresponding charges of Abetment of Cheating by <em>intentionally aiding Jason to cheat</em> the banks through instructing an employee of Tati to submit to JPS documents for the sale and delivery of wood. The documents were used by JPS in support of the five applications to the banks to disburse funds to Tati, when there was no such sales and deliveries of wood. The five charges were framed similarly as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_6"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“You, Tjioe Chi Minh, are charged that you, in Singapore, being a director of Tati Trading Pte Ltd, did abet by intentionally aiding Jason Sim Chon Ang, a director of Jason Parquet Specialist (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“JPS”) to cheat [<em>name of bank</em>], to wit, you instructed your employee to submit an invoice and delivery order bearing reference number [<em>number on the invoice and delivery order</em>] to JPS knowing that JPS would use the said invoice and delivery order to deceive the bank into believing that [<em>description of the quantity, type and dimensions of the wood</em>] were sold and delivered to JPS by Tati Trading Pte Ltd on [<em>date of sale and delivery on invoice and delivery order</em>], when it was not so, and by such manner of deception, dishonestly induced [<em>name of bank</em>] to deliver a sum of [<em>dollar amount</em>] to Tati Trading Pte Ltd on [<em>date of bank transfer of the funds</em>], which the bank would not have done if it was not so deceived, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 420 read with section 109 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Revised Edition).”</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">One charge of financial assistance under the Companies Act</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising from the loan obtained by JPS from DBS via the 1<sup>st</sup> Application made on 7 September 2012, the Prosecution framed the charge against Jason in DAC 924331 of 2018 under the Companies Act as follows:</a></p><a id="p1_7"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“That you, on or about 7 September 2012, being the director of Jason Parquet Specialist (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“JPS”), a company incorporated in Singapore, did knowingly and wilfully authorise JPS to indirectly give financial assistance to one Tjioe Chi Minh (“Tjioe”) of Tati Trading Pte Ltd (“Tati”) in connection with the proposed acquisition by Tjioe of shares in Jason Parquet Holdings Limited (“JPH”), which is the holding company of JPS, to wit, by authorising JPS to obtain a trade financing loan from DBS Bank Ltd so as to pay the sum of S$535,000 to Tati, which was in connection with the proposed acquisition by Tjioe of 2.5 million shares in the initial public offering of JPH, at S$0.225 per share, by which act JPS had contravened section 76(1)(a)(ii)(B) of the Companies Act (Chapter 50, 2006 Revised Edition) (“the Act”), and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 76(5) of the Act read with section 408(3)(b) of the Act.”</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the evidence adduced in the trial and having considered the submissions of the Prosecution and Defence, I am satisfied that the five charges against Jason for the offence of Cheating have been established beyond a reasonable doubt. Jason is therefore guilty of the five charges of Cheating. However, Jason is not guilty of the charge under the Companies Act for indirectly giving financial assistance to Tjioe to acquire shares in Jason Parquet Holdings Limited (“JPH”).</a></p><a id="p1_8"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Tjioe, it has not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he had <em>intentionally aided Jason to cheat</em> the banks. Tjioe is therefore acquitted of all the five charges against him for Abetment of Cheating.</a></p><a id="p1_9"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prosecution’s Case</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution submitted that this is a straightforward case of invoice financing fraud. In essence, the Prosecution’s Case was that the three banks had disbursed funds to Tati as a result of being deceived by fictitious invoices and delivery orders submitted in support of invoice financing applications made by JPS to the banks.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Prosecution’s Case that Jason, in authorising the submission of the applications with the supporting documents which purportedly showed that the goods had been purchased and delivered from Tati to JPS, had by such a manner of deception, dishonestly induced the three banks to disburse funds to Tati. The banks would not have disbursed the monies if they had known that there were no deliveries of the wood as described in the invoices and delivery orders.</a></p><a id="p1_11"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also the Prosecution’s Case that Tjioe had instructed an employee – PW10 (“Sally”) – of Tati to prepare the invoices and delivery orders with the intention of aiding Jason in cheating the banks.</a></p><a id="p1_12"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the charge under the Companies Act against Jason, the Prosecution’s Case is that the loan of $535,000 disbursed to Tati on 11 September 2012 were used by Tjioe to subscribe for shares in JPH, the holding company of JPS and this amounted to indirectly giving financial assistance to Tjioe in connection with the acquisition of shares in JPH and was in contravention of Section 76(1)(a)(ii)(B) Companies Act. The amount of $535,000 was received by Tati on 11 September 2012 and a cheque of the same amount was issued by Tati to Tjioe on 12 September 2012. Tjioe deposited the cheque into his personal bank account. Subsequently, Tjioe used a sum of $568,518.75 from his bank account to subscribe for JPH shares.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Defence’s Case</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">For the First Accused Jason</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jason raised several defences to the charges against him. First, he claimed that there were genuine transactions underlying <b>all</b> the invoice finance applications. Second, in relation to the First Charge (<em>DAC 924315 of 2018</em>) and Fifth Charge (<em>DAC 924319 of 2018</em>), Jason had earmarked the goods which were to be delivered <em>subsequently</em>. In relation to the Second Charge (<em>DAC 924316 of 2018</em>), Third Charge (<em>DAC 924317 of 2018</em>) and Fourth Charge (<em>DAC 924318 of 2018</em>), Jason’s position was that the goods had already been ordered, invoiced previously by Tati and physically delivered to JPS under the “A” series of invoices and delivery orders. The invoices used in support of the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Applications were “consolidation invoices” under the “TT” series of invoices and delivery orders.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the charge of indirectly providing “financial assistance” under the Companies Act, it is the position of Jason that this charge is connected to the First Charge and if Jason is found innocent of the First Charge, <em>a fortiori</em>, he cannot be found guilty of the charge under the Companies Act.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">For the Second Accused Tjioe</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence for Tjioe submitted that the documents of Tati given to JPS were meant to reflect genuine business transactions between JPS and Tati. Furthermore, Tjioe did not instruct Sally on how to prepare the invoices and delivery orders and he also did not know that they were to be used by JPS for <b><em>post-delivery</em></b> invoice financing. In gist, Tjioe did not know Jason was committing acts of cheating on the banks and he did not intentionally aid Jason to dishonestly induce the banks to disburse the funds to Tati.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Key Issues</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relevant elements of the cheating offences under Section 420 Penal Code for the present case are the <em>deception of the banks which induced the disbursement of funds</em> by the banks to Tati together with a <em>dishonest intention</em> on the part of Jason.</a></p><a id="p1_17"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a><a id="p1_18">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept the submission of the Prosecution that, in the context of the deception of a corporate body (such as the banks in the case), for the element of deception to be proved, it is sufficient for the Prosecution to show that the banks’ processes were utilised to induce the banks to act in a manner that it would not have acted if the misrepresentation was not made (see <em>Leck Kim Koon v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26688-SSP.xml')">[2021] SGHC 236</a>).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the evidence adduced in the course of this trial and the submissions of the Prosecution and the Defence at the end of the trial, the key issues to be resolved in this case are specific to and different for Jason and Tjioe.</a></p><a id="p1_19"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issues in respect of the First Accused Jason</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jason is the CEO of JPS and the applications for the funds were made upon his directions to the staff of JPS.

The obtaining of the funds from the banks was based on the applications submitted to the banks in accordance with the prescribed forms and the necessary supporting documents. It would be a mockery of the processes required by the banks for the disbursements of the funds if the applicant JPS could submit supporting documents which contained untrue material information.</a></p><a id="p1_23"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banks were misled by the purported purchase of wood documented by the invoices. There were also no deliveries of wood of the types, dimensions and quantities either before or on the dates stated in the documents. Consequently, there was no receipt of any wood in good order and condition by JPS as at the date stated in the documents or before that date. In this manner, the banks were deceived into disbursing the monies to Tati’s bank account.</a></p><a id="p1_24"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Finding #2 There was no evidence of “earmarking” of goods.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of the business dealings between JPS and Tati over the years, JPS had on many occasions ordered wood from Tati for projects which JPS had been awarded and for which JPS needed timber from Tati. The usual processes by which the wood is purchased from Tati and delivered to JPS is by way of the issuance of a Purchase Order by JPS addressed to Tati. In respect of the 1<sup>st</sup> Application on 7 September 2012, Jason claimed that he had earmarked the wood that JPS needed from Tati for the Twin Peaks project that JPS had been awarded. He claimed that the raw timber and quantities had been identified by him and Tjioe at Tati’s warehouse.</a></p><a id="p1_25"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the 5<sup>th</sup> Application on 16 March 2015, the background was that JPS was awarded a sub-contract by DDS Contracts &amp; Interior Solutions Sdn Bhd (“DDS”) on 8 May 2014 to supply and install timber flooring for a project in Kuala Lumpur known as the IB Tower project. The person from JPS in charge of this sub-contract was JPS’ Project Director New Sze Wei (“DW4”). The sub-contract required a certain quantity of engineered hardwood flooring and on 3 July 2014, JPS issued its Purchase Order (Exhibit D13) to Tati for the purchase of that quantity of engineered oak for about 1.66 million ringgit.</a></p><a id="p1_26"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It transpired that on 18 August 2014, JPS had received instructions from DDS to suspend works for the IB Tower project. It seemed that DDS was not going to get the work from the project. On 9 February 2015, JPS acknowledged the Statement of Final Account issued by DDS. In the light of the unfavourable developments for the IB Tower project, there was no basis for JPS to obtain the loan of $500,000 from DBS to pay Tati for goods supposedly earmarked for the IB Tower project.</a></p><a id="p1_27"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jason’s evidence of “earmarking” is an afterthought and not only was it not corroborated by Tjioe, representing Tati (the seller of the wood), it was in fact contradicted by Tjioe. I accept the submissions by the Prosecution as laid out at Paragraph 73(a) to (c) of Prosecution’s Closing Submissions (“PCS”) on this point. In particular, the following answer given by Tjioe (Notes of Evidence (“NE”) Day 26 at page 20, lines 27-31), when cross-examined by the DPP, was decidedly unequivocal:</a></p><a id="p1_28"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in other words, when Mr Jason Sim says that on that day New had earmarked goods for the IB Tower project, it’s not possible, isn’t it? Do you agree?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is his view. I’m selling goods all the time. I don’t earmark goods.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if there was some kind of “earmarking” of the wood, it would not afford Jason a valid defence to the charges. Jason had knowingly deceived the banks, as at the dates of the loan applications, into believing that goods had been purchased, delivered from the supplier and received by JPS in good order and condition. Although one can accept that delivery need not mean only delivery to the office address as stated in the delivery orders. Nevertheless, it is clear that the representations to the banks were that goods had been delivered and received in good order and condition. This was plainly untrue. No amount of “constructive delivery” would cure the falsity of the stated delivery and receipt in those supporting documents.

However, I am mindful that the defence of “consolidation invoices” was canvassed by Jason based on the evidence of Sally, the person who had prepared the invoices. She had testified that she had come up with the fictitious descriptions of the wood in the TT invoices as she wanted to avoid the trouble and tedium of listing all the descriptions of the past invoices under the “A” series.</a></p><a id="p1_31"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally’s evidence on her method for the preparation of the invoices and of typing in the fictitious particulars for the description and dimensions of wood would not absolve Jason of his use of those documents in a manner that proved to be misleading to the banks.

The $700,000 obtained from the 3rd Application of $500,000 from MayBank and the 4th Application of $200,000 from StanChart submitted on the same day of 7 May 2014, were only used subsequently on 31 December 2014 to contra or reduce the debt owed by JPS to Tati as of that date based on invoices from 5 May to 2 October 2014.</a></p><a id="p1_35"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Finding #4 Authorising the Applications knowing the banks require delivery proved Jason’s dishonesty.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jason admitted to the Commercial Affairs Department (“CAD”) that he knew that delivery of goods was a condition for obtaining finance from the banks. Jason also knew that no goods, as described in the invoices and delivery orders, had been delivered to JPS as at the dates of the loan applications for the disbursements of the funds to Tati. Jason intended for the monies disbursed to be advance payments or deposits as evidenced by the testimonies of the JPS staff and Tati’s Sally. Their testimonies were supported by the documentary evidence of the use of the monies disbursed to Tati for subsequent set-offs or contra payments of what JPS owed Tati.</a></p><a id="p1_36"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be made clear that the dishonesty of Jason is not in terms of JPS getting the loans without the intention of paying back the monies to the banks. It is also not about Jason obtaining funds for JPS from the banks to pay Tati with no regard to any genuine business dealings JPS had with Tati. JPS had proper business dealings with Tati and had a running account of sizable amounts with Tati in view of the many years of transactions with Tati. This is a very important aspect or feature of this case, particularly when we examine the situation for Tjioe later on.</a></p><a id="p1_37"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, the dishonesty of Jason is in obtaining the loans that JPS would not have been able to obtain if the banks had known that the goods (in this case the wood stated in the invoices and delivery orders) as documented did not exist and therefore could not have been delivered or received in good order and condition. The banks had relied on the representation that there were goods purchased and received in good order and condition, before releasing the funds applied for by JPS on the direction and authorisation of Jason as the CEO of JPS.</a></p><a id="p1_38"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Finding #5 Tjioe did not instruct Sally to give fictitious details.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am unable to accept the Prosecution’s submissions that Tjioe had instructed Sally to prepare <em>fictitious</em> documents. The evidence adduced at trial neither support such an assertion nor allow for such a finding of fact to be made. The testimony of Sally was that Tjioe had told her the amount that JPS intended to pay Tati. Sally would then prepare the documents that JPS needed in order that Tati could receive payment but there is no evidence that Tjioe told Sally to put in false or fictitious information. Sally testified, and her evidence on this was not contradicted in any way by the Prosecution, that she had prepared the invoices and delivery orders to be submitted to JPS in that manner on her own volition.</a></p><a id="p1_39"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a><a id="p1_40">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally’s evidence that she prepared the documents on her own is backed up by her actions. In particular, the way the invoice was prepared by her in connection with the 1<sup>st</sup> Application unwittingly revealed the truth in her testimony. Tjioe had told her that JPS intended to pay Tati the amount of $500,000 for the Twin Peak project and left the preparation of the documents to her. Sally proceeded to prepare the invoice as an “A” invoice and included the GST component of 7% which came up to $35,000. Therefore, the invoice reflected the price of $535,000 for the goods. This “error” showed that it was Sally who decided exactly how to prepare the documents and what details of dimensions and quantities are to be included. More significantly, it also showed that Tjioe did not instruct Sally to generate the false information and include the false particulars in the documents.</a></p><a id="p1_40"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a><a id="p1_41">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally admitted in court, with no evidence to the contrary from the Prosecution, that she had prepared the documents in that manner out of convenience or expediency. She did not do it to deceive anyone. It would be pertinent to recall her testimony (NE Day 8 at page 71, line 23 to page 72, line 13) on why she had done so:</a></p><a id="p1_41"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.

This is a very strong point made by the Prosecution that Tjioe knew of the falsity of the documents and was being dishonest. However, my assessment of his admissions is that although he knew the documents were for “payment purposes”, he was not admitting that they were prepared for misleading the banks and to assist Jason in cheating the banks. The DPP made much of the following answer of Tjioe to the last question – Question 97 – of his CAD statement P61:</a></p><a id="p1_43"> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2" frame="none" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="25.14%"><col width="74.86%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class="" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Question 97:</p> </td><td class="" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Do you have anything to add to your statement?</p> </td></tr><tr><td class="" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Answer:</p> </td><td class="" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">I have told you everything as honestly as possible.

More significantly, it had to be understood in the light of Sally’s undisputed evidence in court that she was the one who had come up with the short-cuts and used made-up descriptions and figures for the documents she had prepared to be given to her JPS counterparts involved in accounting and finance. Sally’s uncontradicted evidence is that she was the person who came up with the “A” and “TT” system of preparing invoices issued by Tati to JPS.</a></p><a id="p1_44"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a><a id="p1_45">45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An objective reading of the several statements of Tjioe would show that Tjioe was being candid and trying to help clarify to the best of his ability what he understood of the whole situation. The Prosecution placed a lot of emphasis on the fact that Tjioe knew the payments were deposits or advance payments and therefore Tjioe was dishonest. In my view, this emphasis is not warranted and has led to an unfair inference that Tjioe was dishonest or had knowledge of the manner by which Jason cheated the banks.</a></p><a id="p1_45"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a><a id="p1_46">46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prosecution submitted that an inference can be drawn against Tjioe that he knew or was at least aware that the invoices and delivery orders prepared by Sally did not reflect actual purchases and deliveries. However, it would be a mistake to then infer that Tjioe had acted with the criminal intent to help Jason cause wrongful loss to the banks or wrongful gain to Tati. The documentary evidence of the business transactions between JPS and Tati showed that Tati had maintained a long running account with JPS. There were many payments received by Tati from the bankers of JPS and these funds were applied towards Tati’s supplies of wood to JPS through the years. These were legitimate business dealings and transactions between the two ongoing concerns.</a></p><a id="p1_46"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a><a id="p1_47">47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Tjioe’s perspective, and Tati’s accounting records, the deposits or advance payments were for regular supplies of wood and were not payments for non-existent or bogus transactions. All the payments were properly accounted for between JPS and Tati and periodically recorded in the form of debit, credit and contra documentation.</a></p><a id="p1_47"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a><a id="p1_48">48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that some of the payments were recorded as “contra” payments for future invoices does not detract from the lack of criminal intent on the part of Tjioe. In fact, it adds to the credibility of Tjioe that he had never intended to help Jason commit any criminal offence and definitely not to cheat the banks.</a></p><a id="p1_48"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a><a id="p1_49">49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outcome of this trial for Tjioe is not the same as the result for Jason because Tjioe is charged for a different offence from Jason. Tjioe is being accused of <em>intentionally aiding Jason to cheat</em>. For Tjioe to be convicted, it must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Tjioe knew that Jason was cheating the banks and that Tjioe possessed the intention to provide assistance in the doing of that criminal act. It is not enough merely to show that he had provided documents which were used subsequently by Jason to commit the cheating offences without proof that Tjioe had knowledge that Jason was going to use them to commit a crime.</a></p><a id="p1_49"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a><a id="p1_50">50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My finding is that although Tjioe was aware of the use of the TT invoices and delivery orders for financing purposes, there is no evidence that he was aware that Jason’s use of the documents would be an improper or illegal way of obtaining the funds from the banks or that Jason would be committing any offence against the banks.</a></p><a id="p1_50"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a><a id="p1_51">51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am inclined to find that Tjioe did not intend to aid Jason in cheating the banks. At the very least, based on the evidence adduced in this trial, I am not satisfied that Tjioe intended to help Jason illegally obtain those funds.</a></p><a id="p1_51"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a><a id="p1_52">52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no evidence that Tjioe was aware that Jason was obtaining funds from the banks improperly or had done so not in accordance with what the banks required of JPS in their loan applications. Tjioe was not privy to the banking arrangements between JPS and the banks. The funds received by Tati from the banks were properly recorded as deposits or advance payments and these were subsequently used to contra against payments due from wood supplied to JPS in a running account between JPS and Tati. Tati’s staff Sally dealt with the JPS staff openly and with records of the delivery of goods and accounted for the various payments. Everything was done with a proper paper trail.</a></p><a id="p1_52"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a><a id="p1_53">53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt in my mind that Tjioe, Sally and all the JPS staff involved in the documentation knew that the invoices and delivery orders were for the specific purpose of obtaining financing from the banks but it is my finding that only Jason had the dishonest intention, in that he knew that the banks would not have disbursed the funds to Tati but for the representation that the goods had been delivered and received by JPS in good order and condition.</a></p><a id="p1_53"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a><a id="p1_54">54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am satisfied that Tjioe did not have the intention to help Jason cheat the banks. At worst, Tjioe was, like Sally, without enquiring further, prepared to give JPS the type of documents (<em>i.e.</em> invoices and delivery orders with the dates left blank) they had requested, so that Tati could receive the payments. The intentions of Tjioe, Sally and even the finance staff of JPS involved in the whole chain of events to obtain the funds from the banks must be seen in the light of the many years of regular business between Tati and JPS.</a></p><a id="p1_54"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a><a id="p1_55">55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution argued that since Tjioe knew the documents were being used for obtaining finance, he must have intended to aid Jason to cheat the banks. However, Tjioe’s knowledge that JPS needed the documents for bank financing is not the same as saying that Tjioe knew that Jason was cheating the banks through those loan applications. I am aware that this might seem like a very fine distinction but it is a vital and crucial one nevertheless.</a></p><a id="p1_55"> <p class="Judg-Heading-3"> <b>Finding #7</b> The financial assistance charge is not proved as the $568,518.75 used by Tjioe to subscribe for JPH shares belonged to Tjioe.</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a><a id="p1_56">56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On whether Jason is to be found guilty on the charge under the Companies Act, the Prosecution assumed that the fact that the $568,518.75 used by Tjioe to pay for the subscription of shares in JPH could be traced to include the amount of $535,000 JPS had borrowed to pay Tati would be sufficient to establish the charge. This assumption fails to take into account that Tati could deal with its funds including making a payment to its company directors.</a></p><a id="p1_56"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a><a id="p1_57">57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial assistance charge against Jason was not established for the reason that the loan of $535,000 obtained from DBS in September 2012 by JPS on the authorisation of Jason was an advance payment to Tati for the Twin Peak project. The subsequent use of that payment by Tati was entirely within the rights of Tati and can be legitimately divorced from any connection with JPS.</a></p><a id="p1_57"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a><a id="p1_58">58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Prosecution’s suggestion that the early advance payment to Tati for the Twin Peak project was motivated by Jason’s desire to enable Tjioe to subscribe for JPH shares during the Initial Public Offering (“IPO”). The timing was not a coincidence. However, that motive alone is not determinative of whether Jason is guilty or not guilty of the charge under the Companies Act.</a></p><a id="p1_58"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a><a id="p1_59">59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth of the matter was that Jason was seizing upon the opportunity of the upcoming Twin Peak project that JPS had secured. Jason knew that JPS would need wood from Tati when the Twin Peak project gets underway. Jason decided to authorise the advance payment to Tati. In this way, Jason would secure the supply of wood for JPS from Tati for the upcoming project and Tjioe would be able to subscribe for JPH shares in the IPO, thereby killing the proverbial two birds with one stone.</a></p><a id="p1_59"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a><a id="p1_60">60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate that there is nothing sinister about having more than one objective in mind, consider the hypothetical situation whereby there were actual goods delivered by Tati to JPS and Tati has not been paid for those goods. At the same time, Jason suggested to Tjioe to subscribe for JPH shares and Tjioe told Jason that he would need JPS to pay Tati for its outstanding debts so that Tati could pay Tjioe and Tjioe would have funds to subscribe for JPH shares. Jason then authorised JPS to obtain a bank loan to pay Tati to settle that debt. That would not be improper even though Jason’s intention was two-fold.</a></p><a id="p1_60"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a><a id="p1_61">61&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, my finding is that the Prosecution had failed to prove the charge under the Companies Act against Jason. Although Jason had improperly obtained the loan from the banks of $535,000 to pay Tati, the payment to Tati was not illegal as it was a deposit or an advance payment for the Twin Peak project. In the business between Tati and JPS, Tati could be paid in advance for wood to be supplied subsequently. The use of the funds Tati received for its business is well within Tati’s legitimate right to use as it deemed fit.</a></p><a id="p1_61"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a><a id="p1_62">62&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pertinent to note that subsequently the payment of $535,000 received by Tati was set-off against wood supplied to JPS, that is to say that the $535,000 was truly an advance payment to Tati and not a disguised form of financial assistance of using a subsidiary company’s funds to purchase shares of the holding company. It is also pertinent to note that the JPH shares bought by Tjioe with the $568,518.75 from his personal bank account had all along been under his legal and beneficial interest.</a></p><a id="p1_62"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a><a id="p1_63">63&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence Counsel for Jason raised several other points which seemed relevant but on closer inspection were misplaced, inconsequential and not borne out by the evidence.</a></p><a id="p1_63"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a><a id="p1_64">64&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence for Jason submitted that the goods were never meant to be used as collateral by the banks for the loans granted to JPS and therefore it did not matter whether the goods were delivered. Instead, the banks had relied on the personal guarantees of Jason and his brother as security for the loans. This defence was a non-starter as the issue is not whether Jason had deprived the banks of their collateral for the loans by misrepresenting to the banks that there were real goods when there were none. The Prosecution had adduced evidence which showed that there was no wood of the types, quantities and dimensions as described in the documents submitted and that the banks had been misled to release the funds to Tati, which they would not have done if they knew that the information was not true.</a></p><a id="p1_64"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a><a id="p1_65">65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point raised in Jason’s defence is that there was constructive or notional delivery of the wood. This made no sense and is not borne out by the evidence. Even if we were to accept the argument that there can be notional or constructive delivery, the argument failed for the lack of evidence that there was such notional or constructive delivery. The plain and simple fact is that there were no wood of the types, quantities and dimensions as given in the various descriptions contained in the documents. The descriptions were all made up by Sally. There were no such goods, they simply did not exist. If the goods or wood as described in the invoices and delivery orders did not exist, how can there be any actual, notional or constructive deliveries of the same?</a></p><a id="p1_65"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a><a id="p1_66">66&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence of DW7 (“Alex”) did not assist Jason. Alex alluded to the time when he was in DBS two years prior to the time of the offences, that DBS could provide financing for earmarked goods or consolidated invoices. However, such earmarking of goods or use of consolidated invoices would be a deviation from the usual process and JPS would have to seek special approval from the credit approval committee of DBS through the relationship manager of the JPS account. There was no such request by JPS to deviate from the standard process of <em>post-delivery</em> invoicing for any of the two DBS loan applications in this case.</a></p><a id="p1_66"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a><a id="p1_67">67&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The different verdicts that I have arrived at on the charges against Jason and Tjioe flowed consequentially from the above Findings of Fact.</a></p><a id="p1_67"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a><a id="p1_68">68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Prosecution that this is a straightforward case against Jason but it was not so against Tjioe. With a careful analysis of the oral and documentary evidence adduced in the trial and an objective assessment of the circumstances of the case, the just conclusion is that the Second Accused Tjioe did not intentionally aid the First Accused Jason to cheat the banks. Tjioe should not be found guilty as it has not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he possessed the requisite intention to assist Jason to cause wrongful loss to the banks or wrongful gain to Tati.</a></p><a id="p1_68"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a><a id="p1_69">69&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Tjioe, Sally and several staff of JPS (who reported to Jason and took instructions from him on matters of finance) all knew that the documents were for the purpose of obtaining financing from the banks, I am fully satisfied that all of them did not have the guilty knowledge that Jason was using the invoices and delivery orders to commit cheating.</a></p><a id="p1_69"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a><a id="p1_70">70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This court has benefitted from the efforts put in by the teams for the Prosecution and Defence in this trial. I wish to record my appreciation to the Deputy Public Prosecutors Kevin Yong, Tan Zhi Hao and Lai Yan, and the Defence Counsel Letchamanan Devadason, Jonathan Phipps, Shashi Nathan, Jeremy Pereira and Carmen Lee for their assistance to this court.</a></p><a id="p1_70"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a><a id="p1_71">71&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, it leaves me to acknowledge the pre-trial work done by the late Mr P E Ashokan who was the Lead Counsel of the Defence team for Tjioe. He had sadly passed away just before the start of this trial.</a></p><a id="p1_71"> </a></div></content></html>
