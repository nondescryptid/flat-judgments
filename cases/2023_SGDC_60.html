A full speculum examination was conducted, the results of which were unremarkable. Upon inspection of the victim’s anus, there were no lacerations or tears noted. A pregnancy test was done, together with the routine vaginal swabs for common bacterial infection as well as STI infection, like chlamydia and gonorrhoea were taken.

Ed.) by ASP Muhammad Jamil. The making of the statement was done voluntarily by the Accused and was not caused by any inducement, threat or promise. The Accused did not challenge the admissibility of the same. The significance of the statement became clear during cross-examination of the Accused when he was questioned by the learned DPP about his evidence given in court and the statement made to the Police.</a></p><a id="p1_26"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Law</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is trite that in any criminal proceedings, at the end of the trial, the court must decide whether the evidence adduced by the Prosecution was sufficient to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.</a></p><a id="p1_27"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I am mindful that in cases involving sexual offences, it was often the case of the words of the victim against the words of the accused. The general approach to be taken in sexual offences has been laid down in the cases of <em>Khoo Kwoon Hain v PP</em> [1995] 2 SLR 767, <em>Teo Keng Pong v PP</em> [1996] 3 SLR 329 and subsequently approved in <em>Tang Kin Seng v PP</em> [1997] 1 SLR 46. The Honourable Chief Justice Yong Pung How stated the following at [39] and [44]:</a></p><a id="p1_28"> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“In a trial for sexual offences, what is important is that the evidence is weighed carefully, always bearing in mind the relevant aspects of human nature and behaviour. It would be wrong to be bogged down by technicalities especially when it has no logical problem at hand…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my view, the right approach is to analyse the evidence for the Prosecution and for the Defence, and decide whether the complainant's evidence is so reliable that a conviction based solely on it is not unsafe. If it is not, it is necessary to identify which aspect of it is not so convincing and for which supporting evidence is required or desired. In assessing the supporting evidence, the question then is whether this supporting evidence makes up for the weakness in the complainant's evidence. All these would, of course, have to be done in light of all the circumstances of each case and all the evidence, including the defence evidence, as well as accumulated knowledge of human behaviour and common sense.”</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these guiding principles in mind, I will now proceed to analyse the evidence presented by the Prosecution and the Defence at trial. I do not propose to rehash all the evidence led from each individual witness, but I will however, in the course of my Grounds of Decision, deal with the evidence of the material witnesses in this trial.</a></p><a id="p1_29"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Prosecution’s Case</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution’s case is that the Accused, a trusted family friend whom the young victim felt closer to than her own parents, took advantage of his position and her ignorance to violate her on multiple occasions.</a></p><a id="p1_30"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence of the Victim (PW1) </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the first charge, which occurred sometime in 2016, the Prosecution led evidence from the victim, who testified that herself and her sister, PW8, were having tuition in the dining area at the Accused’s house when the victim had a breakout of hives on her arm <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a>.

In respect of the first charge, when it was put to her that there was no logical explanation for the Accused to have asked her to pull her pants down and lay down on the bed if the hives were on her arm, especially when he was allegedly meant to assist her in applying powder on her hives, she had agreed to the same. She was also candid in expressing that the Accused had not in fact asked her to pull down her underwear, but she had done it of her own accord when she was instructed to pull her pants down as she had thought it meant the same thing. This was also consistent with the evidence she had given in her Evidence-in-Chief <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was further put to the victim that the Accused had only touched her buttocks once before when he was assisting his wife to powder her on one of the occasions that she had taken a shower at their house, the victim maintained that it did not happen and that on that occasion he had only touched her back. She was unequivocally clear and consistent in her evidence that the incident where the Accused had touched her butt cheeks and anus was a separate occasion and did not seem to conflate the two occasions <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the second charge, it was put to the victim during cross-examination that the Accused had not used his fingers to touch her at the lower back of her waist just above her pants whilst they were on the couch as alleged, but that he had actually tapped her on the back of her shoulder whilst she was having tuition at the dining table <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a>.

Whilst she could not recall when exactly the incident at the dining table happened, she was clear that it had happened on a separate occasion prior to the incident on the couch <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>. She was, however, sure in her evidence that the incident on the couch happened at least a week before she made the police report <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When questioned on why she never told anyone prior to the police report being lodged in 2019, despite knowing that the incidences in 2016 and 2019 was considered molest, the victim testified that she did not tell her family about what happened all this while because she was afraid that they would not believe her and would choose to believe the Accused instead <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a>. Prior to the matter being reported to the Police, the victim had a good relationship with everyone in the Accused’s family, and was close to the Accused, his wife, their daughter and youngest son. In fact, at the material times, the victim was not close to any of her family members, and instead had acknowledged the Accused as one of the persons whom she trusted the most <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence of the Victim’s mother (PW2)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her evidence, PW2 largely corroborated the evidence given by the victim on how the latter ended up having tuition with Mdm Siti at the Accused’s house. She also testified that the victim was an introvert and largely kept to herself and would not share much with her parents or family. PW2 stated that the victim only started to open herself up more after the police report was lodged and the incidents of molest came to light <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a>. She also confirmed that prior to this, both the victim and her family did not have any kind of trouble or disputes with the Accused and his family <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43">43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PW2 further testified to the fact that throughout the time both families had known each other, the Accused had treated the victim differently from her other two daughters. She stated that whenever the Accused went on family trips where the victim’s family did not join, he would always only get the victim a present and not the other daughters. When questioned, the Accused had stated that it was because the victim ‘is his princess and she’s [his] special’. She also affirmed that the Accused and his wife would only take the victim out for her birthday and not the other daughters <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a>. In fact, when both families planned to go to Malacca together in 2019, the Accused was the one who instructed his wife to call PW2 to request that they take the victim with them in their car. However, the victim’s father was not comfortable with the victim going alone with the Accused’s family and insisted that the victim’s youngest sister, went with her. As the victim’s father was unable to take leave on the same day, the victim’s family only headed up to Malacca separately the following day <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44">44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under cross-examination, PW2 also testified that the victim and her sisters stopped going to the Accused’s house for tuition in 2017 and 2018 as she was busy running a business <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a>.

PW2 explained that this had happened because Mdm Siti had reached out to her sometime in early 2019. According to PW2, Mdm Siti called because the Accused had instructed the latter to do so as ‘[his] princess is taking PSLE [that] year’. As such, Mdm Siti proposed to give the victim a tuition crash course <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence of Dr Parvathy Pathy (PW4)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45">45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution led evidence from Dr Parvathy Pathy, who was the Senior Consultant, Child Guidance Clinic at the Institute of Mental Health who interviewed the victim and her father on 14 November 2019. Dr Pathy concluded that the victim was able to give an account of the alleged matter and reported some symptoms suggestive of post-traumatic stress and is fit to give evidence in court. Arrangements were also made for the victim to receive counselling <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46">46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Pathy testified that during her consultation with the victim, she observed that the victim was quiet, timid and nervous looking, and was rather hesitant and needed more time to process questions and give an account. After she built a rapport with the victim, she told her that the Accused did inappropriate things to her when she was in Primary 3. Recounting the incident, the victim told Dr Pathy that on that occasion when she had rashes, the Accused offered to apply powder and when the Accused applied powder on the buttocks and he circled her anus with his finger <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47">47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dr Pathy asked what made her eventually disclose the matter, the victim shared that she eventually disclosed the matter to her school counsellor as the Accused began to ask her if her younger sister had pubic hair and she began to worry that the Accused might do the same things to her sister. During cross-examination, Dr Pathy explained that from her personal experience in this field and in the literature on child sexual abuse, she is not surprised that the reason why the child does not tell anyone about the incident earlier is that they are afraid that nobody would believe them. She also made sure to ask the victim if she was telling the truth and that she could be punished if she lied, and the victim stated that she was telling the truth regarding the Accused <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence of Dr Geetha Visvalingam (PW5)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48">48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution led evidence from Dr Geetha, who was the Associate Consultant from the Division of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital who had interviewed the victim after the police report was lodged. Her main role and the purpose of her interview with the victim was to ascertain the brief background facts or context which the sexual assault took place as well as the mode of sexual assault. This would then guide Dr Geetha in assessing the various tests and physical examinations that would need to be conducted accordingly <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49">49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Dr Geetha’s evidence given at trial, she testified that during her consultation with the victim, the victim told her that when the Accused applied powder on the buttocks and then circled her anus with his finger, he did not put his finger inside her anus in relation to the alleged molest in 2016 i.e. the first charge as recorded in her medical report <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a>. She further testified that the tear at 5 o’clock of the hymenal ring and as well as a partial tear at around 10 o’clock of the hymenal ring was an old hymenal tear but whether the said tear is correlated to the sexual assault is inconclusive as there are many causes for hymenal tears. However, Dr Geetha stated that having hymenal tears is not common for a person like the victim who was not sexually active, unless the victim was doing some horseback riding or gymnastics or had a fall or where there is clear cut trauma, for example, from bicycle rides. In the absence of some history suggestive of these things, it is very unlikely that the victim just happened to have a hymenal tear <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence of Ms Deon Tan-Goh Siew Hui (PW6)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50">50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution also led evidence from Ms Deon, who was the school counsellor at the primary school the victim was attending at the time. She testified that she had been having sessions with the victim even prior to the victim divulging the incidents of sexual assault to her. She first started seeing the victim when the latter approached her expressing thoughts of self-harm sometime in August 2019 <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a>. The victim had told her that she felt neglected by her parents and felt lousy about herself <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51">51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereafter, Ms Deon continued to follow up with her for a few more sessions. Sometime after the 2019 September school holidays, the victim approached Ms Deon urgently to inform her about the incidences of sexual assault that she had experienced from the Accused. That was the first time the victim had divulged to Ms Deon that she was being touched inappropriately. When Ms Deon questioned the victim on why she felt the need to share it with her then, the victim replied that she was worried that the same thing would happen to her younger sister, PW8, as the Accused had started to ask if the latter had grown pubic hairs <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52">52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under cross-examination, Ms Deon testified that when the victim had first divulged this information to her, she told her that it was her tutor’s husband who is a family friend that had touched her inappropriately since she was in Primary 3 <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a>. The victim also shared with Ms Deon that there was a break for about a period of two years before she resumed tuition with Mdm Siti <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span>. According to what the victim had told her, the reason why they had stopped going for tuition at the Accused’s house was because the family had gone through some financial difficulties when her mother’s business partner ran away. As the family was struggling to cope, they had stopped contacting the Accused and his family for a period of about two years <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53">53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Ms Deon was not told by the victim specific details like exact locations and dates of the occurrence of each of the incidences <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a>, she maintained in her evidence that the victim was coherent in recounting the incidents and was consistent in doing so <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span>. This was even so when Ms Deon conceded to the learned Defence Counsel’s suggestion that there might have been some loss in translation between what was actually shared to her by the victim and what Ms Deon might have interpreted or understood from what she was being told.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54">54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Deon further testified that according to protocol, before the case could be reported to the Child Protection Services, she would first need to seek concurrence from her school leaders i.e. the school principal or vice-principal. Before that, she would first need to inform her reporting officer, who would first conduct another interview with the victim before ascertaining whether the matter should be escalated to the school leaders. As her reporting officer was on leave the day the victim first divulged this information i.e. 18 September 2019, Ms Deon had no choice but to let the victim head home that day whilst she waited for further instructions. After ensuring that she was able to keep herself safe upon returning home, the victim was allowed to go home after school <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a>. The next morning, Ms Deon’s reporting officer sat down with the victim and asked her some further questions, before making the decision to inform the school leaders. The decision was then made to report the matter to the Child Protective Services and to bring the victim to make the police report against the Accused <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55">55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the close of Prosecution’s case, I was of the view that the Prosecution had made out a prima facie case against the Accused in respect of the two proceeded charges and accordingly, I called upon the Accused to enter his defence.</a></p><a id="p1_55"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Defence’s Case</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a><a id="p1_56">56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence’s case is one of total denial of the two charges.

In his evidence, the Accused also corroborated the victim’s and her parents’ testimony that amongst the victim and her two sisters, he was closest to the victim.

The Accused testified that he had only known about the victim’s hives breakouts because she had approached him to apply powder for her and he would do so on her instructions. According to the Accused, he would put the powder on his hands and apply it to the parts of the victim’s body where she tells him it was itching.

Following her shower, Mdm Siti had dried the victim, and after the victim complained about feeling itchy to Mdm Siti, Mdm Siti instructed the Accused to apply powder on the victim because she was busy with PW8.

However, it was his evidence that because there was still a lot of residual powder on his hands, he then rubbed his hands all the way down to her legs, touching the victim’s buttocks in the process. He claimed that was the only time he had put powder on the victim after she had showered whilst she was naked, but he had never rubbed his hands in a circular motion on her buttocks <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65">65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the second charge, the Accused testified that the victim resumed tuition at his house again sometime in late August to about mid-September 2019 before her PSLE oral examinations after a break of about two-years <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a>.

According to the Accused, he was seated adjacent to Mdm Siti and the victim at the dining table having his coffee whilst the victim was studying and Mdm Siti was playing a game on her mobile phone. At some point, the victim pushed her books away and took Mdm Siti’s mobile phone from her and started playing the said game on the latter’s mobile phone. The Accused then tapped her on the back of her shoulder and asked her to stop playing as her examinations are upcoming. It was then that the victim pushed his hand away. Subsequently, the victim and the Accused went over to sit at the couch in the living room with the Accused seated beside the victim on the said couch. He then tried to advise her again to stop playing the game on the mobile phone and in the midst of doing so, he had put his arm across her shoulder. According to the Accused, the victim then leaned forward and hunched over. At that point the Accused took it as a sign that the victim did not want to listen to him and wanted to continue gaming, so he let her be and left the living room area and went into the master bedroom to perform his evening prayers. The Accused testified that by the time he had finished his prayers and come out of his room, the victim had already left his house. That was the last time he saw the victim <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66">66&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused also testified that in the course of this entire interaction, he never leaned over and asked the victim for a kiss and neither did the victim elbow him away when he tried to do so.

First, he claimed that the statement was not accurately recorded even though he conceded that he had appended his signature at the end of the statement acknowledging that it had been read back to him in English and he had affirmed it to be true and correct.</a></p><a id="p1_67"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a><a id="p1_68">68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Accused claimed that he had no power to rectify any inaccuracies in his statement as he was just a layperson and he had just agreed to whatever was presented to him. When confronted with the fact that he had made several amendments to his statement, he stated that he was only able to do so because the recorder of the statement, PW10 Investigating Officer Muhammad Jamil bin Agus Rizal (<b>“IO Jamil”</b>), had agreed to amend those errors. The Accused also gave evidence that he had chastised IO Jamil for making such errors on such a serious matter and that he had to be the one to point these out to him.</a></p><a id="p1_68"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a><a id="p1_69">69&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused also claimed that the statement was recorded from him after he had been in the police lock-up for 24 hours where he had not gotten any sleep at all and was under stress. He further asserted that IO Jamil had told him that he would only be offered bail depending on what he said in his statement. As such, his intention was just to agree with whatever was in the statement regardless of whether it was true or correct <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a>.

When questioned further as to why he did not correct this inaccuracy in his statement, he explained that he just wanted to agree with everything IO Jamil was saying as he was tired after all the questioning. And since a kiss on the cheek sounded harmless, he just went with it. He further justified that his understanding of a kiss on the cheek had meant being a touching of the cheek to cheek and not using his lips to kiss the cheeks.

She gave evidence that the victim would sometimes have an outbreak of a skin condition where she would scratch herself until her skin turns red.

Mdm Siti confirmed that the Accused had also been one of the people who had applied the powder on the victim on some occasions, although she cannot recall how often he did so. She gave evidence that on the occasions that the Accused had done so, he would usually apply the powder on the victim’s arms and her legs. Except on one occasion where, under Mdm Siti’s instructions, the Accused had applied powder on the victim’s buttocks and her back after the latter finished showering in the master bedroom. She testified that on that occasion, the Accused did not rub the victim’s buttocks but just did a ‘wipe down’.

In the context of a sexual offence, it is not uncommon that the offending acts are often perpetrated behind closed doors, where the offender is alone with the victim and without the presence of other persons. Thus, in assessing whether the witness’ testimony is “unusually convincing”, the court weighs the demeanour of the witness alongside the internal and external consistencies in the witness’ testimony: <em>AOF</em> at [115]. In this regard, “reliance on the demeanour of witnesses <em>alone</em> will often be insufficient to establish an Accused’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt” [emphasis in original]: <em>Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2006] 4 SLR(R) 0045.xml')">[2006] 4 SLR(R) 45</a> at [42].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79">79&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court’s task must therefore be on “an assessment of the internal consistency within the <em>content</em> of a witness’s testimony” and “an assessment of the external consistency between a witness’s evidence and the <em>extrinsic</em> evidence, which includes testing the former against the inherent probabilities and uncontroverted facts” [emphasis in original]: <em>GCK</em> at [137].</a></p><a id="p1_79"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a><a id="p1_80">80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in the present case, I was mindful that the material witness and victim of the alleged sexual assault is a child. In assessing the credibility of her evidence and her behaviour in relation to the matter, I find the guidance provided in the decision of the High Court in <em>PP v Yue Roger Jr</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23089-SSP.xml')">[2019] 3 SLR 749</a> (“<b><em>Yue Roger Jr (HC)</em></b>”) at [30] – [34] (which was affirmed on appeal by the Court of Appeal in <em>Yue Roger Jr v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23187-SSP.xml')">[2019] 1 SLR 829</a>) to be most instructive:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I accepted that victims of sexual offences may not behave in a stereotypical way. Many victims report their sexual abuse early to a family member, friend, the police, or other persons in authority. However, there is no general rule requiring victims of sexual offences to report the offences immediately or in a timely fashion.</em> Instead, the explanation for any such delay in reporting is to be considered and assessed by the court on a case-by-case basis (see <em>DT v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2001] 2 SLR(R) 0583.xml')">[2001] 2 SLR(R) 583</a> at [62]; <em>Tang Kin Seng v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1996] 3 SLR(R) 0444.xml')">[1996] 3 SLR(R) 444</a> at [79]). While I accept that an omission to report the offence in a timely fashion, in the absence of other evidence, may in certain circumstances make it difficult to establish a case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt, I emphasise that the effect of any delay in reporting always falls to be assessed on the specific facts of each individual case.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Victim’s behaviour in the present case in continuing with her rope skipping training with the Accused until 2010 may at first blush seem odd given that she was the victim of repeated sexual abuse. So was the fact that after one instance of sexual intercourse, she went on to go for training as per normal. However, all this must be seen in the light of the fact that the Victim was at the material time a child of just 13 years, for whom training and competing with the Accused’s private rope skipping team was the centrepiece of her life and, indeed, her aspirations for the future. <em>While the average adult may be expected to react in a particular way – for example, to resist, report or complain about an assault as soon as possible – a child or juvenile cannot be expected to always react similarly. The thinking process, assumptions and viewpoint of a child or juvenile victim may lead to a course of action that may on its face appear unreasonable or improbable to an adult. However, the court must always be mindful of the reasons behind what may seem like unexpected conduct on the part of a child or juvenile victim, and should not measure a child or juvenile by adult standards.</em></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the court should do is to assess, given the evidence in respect of the specific complainant and the allegations made, whether what is put forward is consonant with the likely probabilities. A child or juvenile complainant may not be expected to complain if he or she feels vulnerable, or is otherwise focused on matters other than protecting his or her modesty. <em>A child or juvenile is by definition immature, and should not, in the absence of evidence showing otherwise, be held to the measure of an adult. </em><em>The thought processes and concerns of a child or juvenile may also continue to evolve and permutate as he or she matures, such that it may be some time before he or she is in a position to complain.</em></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, in the present case, the fact that the Victim did not complain in a timely manner and remained in contact with the Accused over the extended duration of the abuse did not rob her of credibility; I accepted that the Victim was focused on her continued participation in the private rope skipping team, and did not know what to do about the Accused’s sexual advances. I accepted her explanation that she did not resist or report the offences to a teacher or family member as rope skipping was her priority at that time and she feared that her place on the private rope skipping team would be jeopardized were she to do so. I also accepted that she had not reported the offences to her family or the police as she felt ashamed.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the fact that the Victim was not driven to despair or helplessness was not by itself a ground for disbelief of her evidence. People react in different ways to sexual abuse and may compartmentalize or rationalize their reactions. A calm, undisturbed disposition may generally incline the court to conclude that no wrong was committed, but it is not necessary for a complainant to be distraught for her to be believed.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[<em>Emphasis added</em>]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81">81&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, to consider if the victim’s evidence is so “unusually convincing” that it warrants a finding of guilt is therefore a holistic exercise which is weighed against the entire body of evidence before the court.

I observed that she tried her best to answer the questions that were posed to her by the Prosecution as well as by the learned Defence Counsel, and she did not exaggerate or embellish her answers in order to implicate the Accused.

However, in his statement given to the police, the Accused agreed that he had given a different version when he stated that there were other occasions when the victim went over to him and told him that her butt was itchy and so he rubbed powder on her buttocks and her back using his hand to rub her buttocks by making circular motions.</a></p><a id="p1_98"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a><a id="p1_99">99&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffice for me to note, when he was confronted with the inconsistencies between his testimony and his police statement (Exhibit “<b>P9</b>”) recorded shortly after his arrest, on 20 September 2019, the Accused sought to disclaim responsibility for the contents of the statement, notwithstanding that the statement was made voluntarily and admitted by consent at the commencement of the trial.</a></p><a id="p1_99"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a><a id="p1_100">100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Defence elected not to cross-examine the recorder of the statement, IO Jamil during the Prosecution’s case.

He was convicted after trial. For the s 354(2) charge, he used his hand to touch the victim’s left breast <em>over her clothes</em> by grabbing her breast and using his thumb to rub it in an up and down motion lasting for about a minute. The judge pitched the starting point as 16 months’ imprisonment (which was eventually reduced to 14 months’ imprisonment due to totality because the sentences for all 3 charges ran consecutively) and imposed 18 weeks’ imprisonment in lieu of nine strokes of the cane.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118">118&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second case was <em>PP v BNO</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22397-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGHC 243</a> (“<b><em>BNO</em></b>”). In <em>BNO</em>, the accused was the parent of the nine-year-old victim’s friend. He took advantage of the trust reposed in him by the victim’s parents and the victim when he violated the victim when the victim was sleeping over at his place. For the s 354(2) charge involved, the victim was pretending to sleep when the offender touched the victim’s penis for a few seconds from outside the victim’s shorts before pulling the victim’s shorts down and touching the victim’s exposed penis. He then fellated the victim. He was convicted after trial in the High Court. Justice See Kee Oon found that this was a case that fell in the middle-upper of Band 2 and imposed a sentence of two (2) years’ imprisonment and three (3) strokes of the cane.

In <em>GCY</em>, the offender was charged with 21 counts of aggravated outrage of modesty under s 354(2) Penal Code and two other charges under the Films Act (Cap. 107, 1998 Rev. Ed.) The three charges faced by the offender involved the following acts:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_120-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting his hand into one of the victims’ (“A1”) shorts and rubbing her vulva back and forth (skin-on-skin);</a></p><a id="p1_120-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_120-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_120-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using four fingers, which were placed together, to rub A1’s vulva in a forward and backward motion (skin-on-skin):</a></p><a id="p1_120-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_120-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_120-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting his hand into another victim’s (“A2”) shorts and rubbing her vulva back and forth (skin-on-skin).</a></p><a id="p1_120-p2_c"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120-p2_c"></a><a id="p1_121">121&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence also submitted that the Accused in the present case exhibited a lower level of premeditation for the first charge and with respect to the second charge, which was an attempt charge, the level of premeditation was even lower. In comparison, the learned Defence Counsel submitted that the accused in <em>GCY</em> displayed a significantly higher level of premeditation by using games on his mobile devices or drawings to distract them whilst he molested them. Further, the fact that he recorded them while doing so was an aggravating factor as it displayed a presence of mind to relive the incidents for his own pleasure and gratification.</a></p><a id="p1_121"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a><a id="p1_122">122&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the element of abuse of trust, the Defence submitted that there are primarily two types of such abuse – the first being a situation where the accused is in a position of responsibility towards the victim e.g. parent and step-parents and their children, medical practitioners and patients, teachers and their pupils. The second being a situation where the victim places her trust in the accused by virtue of his office of employment e.g. a bus driver and a school child (<em>GBR</em> at [29(c)]). The learned Defence Counsel further submitted that deterrence is an important consideration where there is an abuse of trust in an inter-familial context, due to the challenge of detection of the offences and the consideration barriers faced by the victim in reporting them (<em>GBR</em> at [29(c)]). In this regard, the Defence conceded that the victim was treated as a family member and that the Accused had a responsibility towards her. The Defence also conceded that the Accused did abuse his position of trust placed onto him not only by the victim but also the victim’s parents. However, the learned counsel sought to argue that the level of abuse is not as significant as it is in <em>GCY.</em> In doing so, it was submitted that in <em>GCY¸</em> it involved three young victims (aged 4 to 9 years old) – one of whom was the child of the accused’s parent’s neighbour (with whom the parents shared such a close neighbourly relationship that the victim was allowed to be with the accused and his children unsupervised), and another was the daughter of the accused’s sister. The Defence contended that the abuse of position from an inter-familial context is more significant than it is in a teacher-student relationship as compared to the present case. It was their submission that there is a greater inherent trust placed on a family member than would a teacher, who ultimately is a stranger to the family.</a></p><a id="p1_122"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a><a id="p1_123">123&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Defence submitted that the harm caused in the present case is on the low to medium end of the spectrum. To buttress this point, the Defence argued that the degree of sexual exploitation and low level of abuse of the Accused’s position of trust only caused minor psychological harm and that there is no evidence that the victim’s future has been affected.</a></p><a id="p1_123"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a><a id="p1_124">124&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the learned Defence Counsel sought to rely on <em>PP v BLV</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20507-SSP.xml')">[2017] SGHC 154</a> wherein Aedit Abdullah JC (as he then was), noted that s 354(2) Penal Code represents a general position that offences against minors warrant more severe punishment. However, s 354(2) is not intended to treat <em>all</em> offences committed against minors equally. Specifically, the Defence highlighted that Aedit Abdullah JC held that with respect to enhanced offences, “<em>the aggravating factor of young age would apply if the victim was materially younger than the stipulated age ceiling, and in a graduated manner depending on how much young the victim was”.</em> Furthermore, it would further aggravate the offence if the victim possesses further vulnerabilities, e.g. the victim suffered from any mental or physical infirmities which would warrant a harsher sentence. The Defence submitted that in the present case, the victim was not particularly vulnerable, save for her young age and there were no other aggravating factors.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125">125&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the above considerations, the learned Defence Counsel submitted that a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment for the first charge and three (3) months’ imprisonment for the second charge would thus be appropriate. The learned Defence Counsel further submitted that caning should not be imposed in the present case as there are no substantial aggravating factors.</a></p><a id="p1_125"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a><a id="p1_126">126&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the learned Defence Counsel urged this court to order the sentences for the two charges to run concurrently, making a global sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment.</a></p><a id="p1_126"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentencing Considerations</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a><a id="p1_127">127&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In deciding on the appropriate sentence to impose, I have considered the applicable sentencing framework for outrage of modesty cases as set out in the case of <em>GBR</em>, and the two-step sentencing bands approach as set out above.</a></p><a id="p1_127"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a><a id="p1_128">128&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, both parties agreed that the present case falls within Band 2 of the <em>GBR</em> sentencing framework. However, the parties disagreed on the calibration of the imprisonment term within the sentencing range as set out in the said framework; which is between one to three years’ imprisonment. I should note that it was also established in <em>GBR</em> that caning is generally imposed for offences that fell within Band 2, with a starting point of three strokes of the cane.</a></p><a id="p1_128"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a><a id="p1_129">129&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the sentencing guidelines in <em>GBR</em>, Band 2 encompasses cases where two or more of the aggravating factors are present. At the lower end of the band are cases where there may be an absence of skin contact with the private parts of the victim, but with other presenting aggravating features; such as the abuse of a position of trust or showing a pornographic film.</a></p><a id="p1_129"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a><a id="p1_130">130&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the higher end of the spectrum are cases where there was skin contact of the victim's private parts, or the use of deception.

Further, as conceded by the Defence, there was an element of an abuse of trust in this instance as the Accused was a close family friend and a father-like figure to the victim, who was also a vulnerable victim given her young age.</a></p><a id="p1_131"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a><a id="p1_132">132&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having carefully considered the respective submissions of the parties, I could not agree with the Defence’s submission that the present case falls into the low end of Band 2 of the sentencing framework. In particular, I could not agree with the Defence that the only harm caused to the victim is “minor psychological harm” and that there is no evidence that the victim’s future has been affected. Quite clearly, the medical report tendered in the course of the trial revealed that the victim has reported some symptoms (i.e. thoughts of self-harm and nightmares) suggestive of post-traumatic stress disorder.</a></p><a id="p1_132"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a><a id="p1_133">133&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that the present case falls within the higher end of Band 2, and that the sentencing considerations of deterrence and retribution ought to feature more prominently in this case. Applying the graduated approach as highlighted by Aedit Abdullah JC in <em>PP v BLV</em> at [132], it would seem that there is a fairly wide range of sentencing outcomes from precedent cases falling within Band 2 anywhere from 15 months to two years and six months’ imprisonment<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a>. The considerations that calibrates the sentencing range accordingly turns on the specific aggravating details of the case e.g. age of the minor, abuse of position of trust, whether there was criminal force or deception used, and whether there was skin-on-skin contact with the private parts.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134">134&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, I could not ignore the relatively young age of the victim in relation to the stipulated age ceiling of 14 years, and at the material time of the offence, the victim did not even realise that what the Accused did to her was wrong until she learned during a sex education class that what had happened was a ‘bad touch’. It would seem that the accused had capitalised on her innocence due to her young age to commit the said acts on her. There was also such an abuse of the position of trust that the victim felt that she could not talk to anyone about what had happened as she did not think that anyone would believe her. The protracted length of abuse due to the difficulty in detecting such acts that has happened in the inter-familial context should be taken as an aggravating factor. However, there was no criminal force or deception used in the present case. I also considered the other aggravating factors of skin-on-skin contact and intrusion of a private part for a sustained period of time.</a></p><a id="p1_134"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a><a id="p1_135">135&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my assessment, the Prosecution’s sentencing submission of at least 18 months’ imprisonment for the first charge, having taken reference from the case of <em>GDX</em>, would be an appropriate sentence.</a></p><a id="p1_135"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Imprisonment term in lieu of caning</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a><a id="p1_136">136&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I next turn to the question of imposition of caning. The case of <em>PP v Chow Yee Sze</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 1 SLR 0481.xml')">[2011] 1 SLR 481</a> at [9] highlights that the well-established sentencing benchmark is <em>nine months’ imprisonment with caning as a starting point</em> for molest or outrage of modesty under s 354 of the Penal Code where “a victim’s private parts or sexual organs [were] intruded” (<em>Chandresh Patel v Public Prosecutor</em> [1995] 1 CLAS News 323; MA 357/1993 (“<em>Chandresh Patel</em>”), <em>per</em> Yong Pung How CJ). The District Judge specifically referred to this sentencing benchmark at [7] of his <em>GD</em>. Since <em>Chandresh Patel</em>, the nine months’ imprisonment plus caning benchmark has consistently been considered by the courts to be the <em>correct benchmark</em> for s 354 offences over the past 15 years. It was also established in <em>GBR</em> that for offences that fell under Band 2 of the sentencing framework, caning will nearly always be imposed, and the suggested starting point would be at least three strokes of the cane.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137">137&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that both general deterrence and retribution take centre-stage in the sentencing considerations, there is clearly a need to compensate for the deterrent effect and retributive effect of caning that was lost by reason of the exception as the Accused is above the age of 50 and is exempted from caning under s 325(1)(b) CPC.</a></p><a id="p1_137"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a><a id="p1_138">138&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was established in the seminal case of <em>Amin bin Abdullah v PP</em> [2017] 5 SLR (“<em>Amin</em>”) that the correct starting point was that an offender’s term of imprisonment should not be enhanced, unless there were grounds to justify doing so. The court should not proceed on the presumptive basis that once an offender was exempted from caning, his sentence of imprisonment should be enhanced. The relevant provisions were worded as open-ended discretion-conferring provisions and the sections were not framed in terms that suggested that the imprisonment sentence should be enhanced in circumstances where there is exemption from caning. This also cohered better with the fact that the courts should not, in general, exercise punitive powers absent sufficient justification.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139">139&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relevant factors that may warrant an enhancement of the sentence of an exempted offender include: (a) the need to compensate for the deterrent effect of caning that was lost by reason of the exemption; (b) the need to compensate for the retributive effect of caning that was lost by reason of the exemption; and (c) the need to maintain parity among co-offenders.</a></p><a id="p1_139"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a><a id="p1_140">140&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court would generally find it helpful to first identify the principal sentencing objective(s) that underlay the imposition of caning for the offence in question.

In my view, the additional term of imprisonment was required to replace the lost deterrent and retributive effect of caning. I was mindful of the Accused’s age at the time of sentencing and there was nothing to indicate to the court that the Accused would suffer disproportionately from the imprisonment term imposed.</a></p><a id="p1_141"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a><a id="p1_142">142&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering the duration of the enhancement, <em>Amin</em> at [89] sets out the indicative ranges of sentences which would better allow sentencing judges to calibrate the extent of the enhancement to fit the circumstances of each case.

This was also in line with what the court had imposed in the case of <em>GDX.</em> In this respect, the duration of enhancement in addition to the 18 months’ imprisonment imposed for this charge would not exceed the sentencing range for an offence under Band 2 of the <em>GBR</em> sentencing framework. As such, an imposition of an enhanced sentence in lieu of caning would not be considered to be manifestly excessive.</a></p><a id="p1_143"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a><a id="p1_144">144&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, for the first charge, I imposed a sentence of <b><u>18 months’ imprisonment and 6 weeks’ imprisonment in lieu of caning</u></b>.</a></p><a id="p1_144"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a><a id="p1_145">145&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the second charge, the Prosecution submitted for a short custodial sentence, whereas the Defence submitted for a three months’ imprisonment term.

As the Prosecution had highlighted in that case, if the sentences were not to be ordered to run consecutively, the effect would be to grant such an offender an unwarranted discount since by having the sentences run concurrently, the offender would escape at least in part, if not entirely, punishment for the corresponding offences.&nbsp; In that judgment, the Honourable Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon stated that the general rule of consecutive sentences for unrelated offences is well justified as a matter of principle and policy.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149">149&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, the convicted charges were of the same nature committed to the same victim, albeit one was an attempt at the commission of the offence. They were clearly unrelated and had happened on two separate occasions under materially different circumstances. The one-transaction rule did not apply here as there was no unity of time or place and the facts that form the subject matter of each charge were materially different. As the offences are distinct and the charges relate to separate incidents that happened on separate occasions, I agreed with the Prosecution that the sentences ought to be ordered to run consecutively. To not order a consecutive sentence would be to give unwarranted discount to the Accused for his multiple offending behaviour.</a></p><a id="p1_149"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a><a id="p1_150">150&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was also mindful of the totality principle – as was noted in <em>Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16232-SSP-M.xml')">[2014] 2 SLR 998</a> (at [2]) (“<em>Shouffee”</em>), that in circumstances where the court is inclined to order sentences to run consecutively, it is necessary for the court to run a final check to ensure that the aggregate sentence is proportionate to the overall criminality presented and not excessive.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151">151&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I did not think that the aggregate sentence would violate the totality principle, in that it would not be disproportionate to the overall criminality and not crushing.
