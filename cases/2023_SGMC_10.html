The Defendant claims that the information imparted to her was not confidential and that she did not breach her confidentiality undertaking. She also claims that the non-compete and non-solicitation covenants were void and unenforceable because they were wider than reasonably necessary to protect the Plaintiff’s interests. The action was tried before me on 3 February 2023, during which parties made oral closing submissions pursuant to Order 108 of the Rules of Court 2014. At the end of the trial, I reserved judgment to consider the papers and submissions more carefully. I now deliver my judgment for this action.</a></p><a id="p1_1"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff was a beauty salon that provided hairdressing, spa, skin care and slimming services.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant was employed as a beautician at the Plaintiff’s salon outlet located at 101 Upper Cross Street, #01-17, People’s Park Centre Singapore 058357.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a> Her employment commenced on 17 September 2018 and ended on 27 March 2021.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the cessation of her employment, the Defendant returned to China on 9 April 2021. On or around 30 July 2021, the Defendant returned to Singapore to commence employment at another company, YS2 Pte Ltd, which operated a shop called “Zenith Beauty Salon” (“Zenith Salon”). It is undisputed that Zenith Salon operated in the same building and the same floor as the Plaintiff’s salon in People’s Park Centre, at #01-37.</a></p><a id="p1_4"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly thereafter, the Plaintiff commenced the present action against the Defendant. The Plaintiff’s claims in this action fell into three broad categories:</a></p><a id="p1_5"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5"></a><a id="p1_5-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Defendant joined Zenith Salon in breach of a non-compete covenant in her employment contract which prohibited her from working for a competitor within a 400 m radius of the Plaintiff’s salon for a period of 2 years.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Defendant had used confidential information belonging to the Plaintiff, namely, customer lists and contact details, to solicit the Plaintiff’s customers after she commenced employment at Zenith Salon.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the Defendant solicited two of the Plaintiff’s employees to join her at Zenith Salon, in breach of a non-solicitation covenant.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant submitted that the customer information was not confidential and denied breaching the confidentiality undertaking. The Defendant also submitted that the restrictive covenants were void and unenforceable as they were wider than reasonably necessary to protect the interest of the parties and the public. The Defendant further took the position that even if the restrictive covenants were reasonable, there was no breach because she did not solicit the Plaintiff’s customers and employees. When the two employees terminated their employment with the Plaintiff, the Defendant was in China and had not even commenced her employment at Zenith Salon. In this regard, one of the two employees, Mong Xin Yi, testified that after she resigned from the Plaintiff on 31 May 2021, she went to work for another company called LMDA Pte Ltd first on 4 June 2021, before she joined Zenith Salon on 23 August 2021.</a></p><a id="p1_6"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I analyse the parties’ claims and submissions, it is apposite to identify the confidentiality and restrictive covenants found in the Defendant’s employment contract dated 1 October 2020 (“Employment Contract”). The Employment Contract superseded an earlier employment contract signed by the Defendant. The three covenants in the Employment Contract that the Plaintiff pursued at trial and in closing submissions are as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6.3: “Upon the termination of employment, you must return to the company all properties, including documents, records, contact numbers, items and materials in your possession that belong to the company or its clients, and you must not retain any copies (inclusive of electronic or soft copies) thereof.

But the presumption may be displaced on proof by the defendant that its conscience was not affected in the circumstances in which the claimant’s wrongful loss of interest had been harmed or undermined (<em>I-Admin (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Hong Ying Ting and others</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24625-SSP.xml')">[2020] 1 SLR 1130</a> (“<em>I-Admin</em>”) at [61]-[62]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff alleged that the confidential information pertains to customer information, including their names and contact details. Customer information can constitute confidential information (<em>Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v Yee Heng Khay (alias Roger)</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26348-SSP.xml')">[2021] SGHC 168</a> (“<em>Angliss</em>”) at [41]). It is not disputed that the Defendant had access to the Plaintiff’s customer names and contact information during her employment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> It is also not disputed that access to such information was restricted to the Plaintiff’s employees. Indeed, clause 4.6 of the Employment Contract also prohibits the Defendant from disclosing to third parties confidential information in the course of her employment. Further, “confidential information” is expressly defined in clause 4.7 of the Employment Contract to include “information that will affect the company’s competitive position”. Like the court in <em>Angliss</em>, I am of the view the value of customer information lies in the “totality of the information” and can be valuable to the Plaintiff’s competitors (at [41]). In these premises, I am prepared to proceed on the basis that the customer information possesses the quality of confidence and were imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am however not satisfied that there had been unauthorised use of the confidential information to the detriment of the Plaintiff. There was no evidence to show that the Defendant had retained customer information and used them to the Plaintiff’s detriment. While Mr Tan Khoon Leng (“Mr Tan”), one of the Plaintiff’s customers, testified that the Defendant contacted him and asked him to patronise Zenith Salon, the Defendant testified that she had Mr Tan’s contact number because he was also her landlord, and she needed to retain his contact number to retrieve her personal belongings at her residence. Apart from Mr Tan, the Plaintiff named two other customers that were allegedly poached by the Defendant, but neither came forward to testify as to the truth of this allegation. Indeed, it was also not put to the Defendant during cross-examination that she had attempted to poach other customers of the Plaintiff after she had left the Plaintiff. In these circumstances, it was not clear to me that the Defendant had retained customer information and used them to poach the Plaintiff’s customers after she joined Zenith Salon.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from customer information, the Plaintiff alleged that its confidential information comprised “trade secrets”. This is nothing more than a bare assertion. No particulars of what constituted the “trade secret” were mentioned in its pleadings. The Plaintiff also did not mention what the alleged “trade secret” comprised in her Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”). In my view, the Plaintiff has neither properly pleaded nor credibly proven this allegation. In any event, the Plaintiff failed to plead or prove that the Defendant had leaked or misused any “trade secret” during her employment with Zenith Salon.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these premises, I find that the Plaintiff has not established that the Defendant had breached clause 6.3 of the Employment Contract.</a></p><a id="p1_16"> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Clauses 6.4 and 6.5 – covenants in restraint of trade</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a><a id="p1_17">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 6.4 and 6.5 are restrictive covenants or covenants in restraint of trade.

On the one hand, it is in the public interest to ensure free movement of skill and labour in the marketplace. On the other hand, it is important to uphold terms agreed between parties. The law seeks to strike balance between the two interests by allowing covenants in restraint of trade to stand if they satisfy the three criteria mentioned at [17] above.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a preliminary point, it should be noted that courts tend to adopt a stricter approach when considering restrictive covenants in employment contracts as compared to a contract for the sale of a business (<em>Smile Inc Dental Surgeons Pte Ltd v Lui Andrew Stewart</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 4 SLR 0308.xml')">[2012] 4 SLR 308</a> (“<em>Smile Inc</em>”) at [20]). This is because (1) the nature of legitimate interest to be protected is different; (2) there is often a disparity in bargaining power in favour of the employer; and (3) public policy requires that every man shall be at liberty to utilise his knowledge and skill in the most advantageous way in the market (<em>Smile Inc</em> at [20]-[21]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff identified three forms of legitimate interests that required protection: (1) confidential information; (2) trade connections; and (3) stable workforce.</a></p><a id="p1_20"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a><a id="p1_21">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidential information is a form of legitimate interest that can be protected by a restrictive covenant. But as the law currently stands in Singapore, confidential information cannot be used to justify the existence of a restrictive covenant if it is already directly protected by other covenants in the contract (<em>Man Financial</em> at [92]; <em>Lek Gwee Noi v Humming Flowers &amp; Gifts Pte Ltd</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 3 SLR 0027.xml')">[2014] 3 SLR 27</a> (“<em>Lek Gwee Noi</em>”) at [66]-[71]). To save the restrictive covenant, the employer has to identify some other form of legitimate interest that the restrictive covenant serves to protect. In the present case, it is clear to me that confidential information is already protected by clause 6.3. Confidentiality undertakings are also found in clauses 4.6, 4.7 and 4.8 of the Employment Contract. In these circumstances, the Plaintiff must identify some other form of legitimate interest to justify the existence of the restrictive covenants. It is to this that I now discuss the Plaintiff’s trade connections.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade connections is a recognised form of legitimate interest that can be protected by a restrictive covenant (<em>Man Financial</em> at [93]). Employers are entitled to protect customer connections that they have built up over time. But the restrictive covenant can only go so far as to protect customers that the employee has “personal knowledge of, and influence over” (<em>Man Financial</em> at [93] and <em>Lek Gwee Noi</em> at [73]). In my view, clause 6.4 goes further than that. It prohibits the Defendant from “engaging in the same industry” altogether. The activity restriction is not confined to customers that the Defendant had dealt with in the course of her employment. There is no evidence that the Defendant had dealt with <em>all</em> of the Plaintiff’s customers. Indeed, the Plaintiff’s case did not even go so far. Clause 6.4 is therefore overly broad for covering not only customers that the Defendant had dealt with but also customers that the Defendant had no dealings with.</a></p><a id="p1_22"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a><a id="p1_23">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6.4 is also overly broad because it does not purport to confine itself to the services that the Defendant had undertaken during her employment with the Plaintiff. For the restrictive covenant to be sustainable, the activity restriction must bear a “close connection with the work done by the employee” (<em>HT SRL v Wee Shuo Woon</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23934-SSP.xml')">[2019] 5 SLR 245</a> (“<em>HT SRL</em>”) at [80]-[81]). Clause 6.4 is a blanket restriction against the Defendant engaging in or working in the beauty industry altogether. The phrase “same industry” is broad enough to encompass companies that provide beauty services that were not even provided by the Plaintiff during the Defendant’s employment, and indeed, beauty services that were not even undertaken by the Defendant during her employment with the Plaintiff. Some of such companies may not have an interest in the customers seeking the services provided by the Plaintiff (see similar comments made in <em>HT SRL</em> at [81]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the Plaintiff has not shown that the activity restriction is reasonable and not unduly wide.</a></p><a id="p1_24"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a><a id="p1_25">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The activity restriction aside, the Plaintiff has not shown that the temporal restriction is reasonable and not unduly wide. Clause 6.4 carries a two-year restriction. Insofar as the restrictive covenant seeks to prevent the departing employee from drawing away the employer’s customers, the restraint ought not to last longer than reasonably necessary for the employer to transfer its trade connection to other employees without active interference from the departing employee (<em>Lek Gwee Noi</em> at [114]). The appropriate temporal restriction is a factual issue to be determined on a case-by-case basis. Whether a particular length of time is reasonable depends on the “strength and presence of the trade connection and the time it takes to build and cement a new trade connection”. This would in turn depend on “the particular industry involved, the life cycle of trade connection in that industry and the role of the departing employee in the employer’s business” (<em>Lek Gwee Noi</em> at [114]).</a></p><a id="p1_25"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a><a id="p1_26">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, the Plaintiff did not adduce credible evidence to show that the two-year period is reasonable. The sole reason given by the Plaintiff’s representative, Ms Han, for imposing a two-year restriction was that the Employment Contract was also a two-year contract. In my view, this is neither here nor there. The Plaintiff did not explain how the length of employment would have a bearing on how long the Plaintiff requires to transfer customer connections to other employees without active interference from the Defendant.</a></p><a id="p1_26"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a><a id="p1_27">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff cited cases where Singapore courts have upheld non-compete clauses with a temporal restriction of two years (<em>Tan Kok Yong Steve v Itochu Singapore Pte Ltd</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21650-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGHC 85</a> (“<em>Tan Kok Yong Steve</em>”) and <em>PH Hydraulics &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Intrepid Offshore Construction Pte Ltd and another</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 4 SLR 0036.xml')">[2012] 4 SLR 36</a> (“<em>PH Hydraulics</em>”)). In my view, the cases were decided on their peculiar facts and are distinguishable. In <em>Tan Kok Yong Steve</em>, the court considered that the former employee himself took four years to build up customer connections, and on that basis, the employer would require at least two years to allow the employee’s replacement to rebuild those connections without interference from the former employee (at [103]). The court also considered that the trading of cement products was a “specialised industry” (at [103]). That the employer was operating in a specialised industry of designing and manufacturing marine hydraulic and electrical installations was also a key reason why the court in <em>PH Hydraulics</em> found a two-year restriction to be reasonable (at [67]). The court in <em>PH Hydraulics</em> also considered that the former employee was a “versatile individual” with “transferrable skill sets” such that the non-compete clause was unlikely to have a serious adverse impact on his livelihood (at [68]). In the present case, the Plaintiff led no evidence to show that the Plaintiff was operating in a specialised industry, such that it would be difficult or time consuming to build fresh trade connections or transfer existing trade connections to other employees. The Plaintiff also did not allege that the Defendant could easily seek alternative employment in other industries. As a Chinese national, providing beauty treatment services could well be her only ticket to seeking gainful employment in Singapore.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the length of time itself is not determinative; it must be assessed against the factual backdrop of each case. A two-year restriction may be reasonable in certain cases but unreasonable in others. To put things in perspective:</a></p><a id="p1_28"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28"></a><a id="p1_28-p2_a">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A two-year restriction was held to be unreasonable in <em>Powerdrive Pte Ltd v Loh Kin Yong Philip and others</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22954-SSP.xml')">[2019] 3 SLR 399</a> at [47]-[49]. The court reasoned that the employer was unable justify the said duration which appears to have been arbitrarily selected.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A two-year restriction was similarly found to be unreasonable in <em>Lek Gwee Noi</em>. In that case, the court found that while the former employee, who was employed as a sales manager, had influence over the employer’s customers, the employer failed to show that it needed two years for its remaining staff to build their own trade connection with those customers. This was notwithstanding the employer’s allegation that its flower business was “seasonal” in that its staff could only build rapport with its seasonal customers during festive seasons (at [116]).</a></p><a id="p1_28-p2_b"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, the Plaintiff is not even alleging that its business was seasonal. Quite the contrary, the Defendant’s evidence was that the Plaintiff’s customers comprise those that had signed “pre-paid packages”, an allegation that was not challenged during cross-examination.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a> To my mind, such customers would have already been financially tied to the Plaintiff until the expiry of their pre-paid packages. It was open to the Plaintiff’s remaining employees to build rapport with them during such time. It is also conceivable that such customers would be patronising the Plaintiff’s business regularly to utilise the pre-paid sessions, even after the Defendant’s departure. Further, the Plaintiff’s representative, Ms Han, made a vague allusion during cross-examination that the confidential information it was seeking to protect extended to products which it found to be effective by trial and error. While I do not accept this as a confidential information that is deserving of protection because it was neither specifically pleaded nor credibly proven, it does not detract from the fact that by the Plaintiff’s own position, its <em>products</em> were the main or one of the main appeals to its customer base. In these circumstances, I find it hard to understand why the Plaintiff would require two years for its remaining staff to establish connection with customers that the Defendant had dealt with.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, counsel for the Plaintiff urged the court to consider adjusting the period of two years to a lesser period using the doctrine of severance. No authorities were however cited when I queried whether this is legally permissible. One of the prerequisites to severance is that the unenforceable portion must be capable of being removed without adding to or modifying the wording of what remains with the remainder continuing to make grammatical sense (<em>Lek Gwee Noi</em> at [155]). It seems to me that reducing the temporal period would entail not merely severing the objectionable portions of the covenant but rewriting the covenant. I decline to do so.</a></p><a id="p1_30"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, while the geographical restriction is only 400m radius from the Plaintiff’s premises, the Plaintiff has not shown that the activity and temporal restrictions are reasonable. Considering all the restrictions in the round, I find that the Plaintiff has not established that clause 6.4 is reasonable and goes no further than reasonably necessary to protect its legitimate interests. It is therefore void and unenforceable.</a></p><a id="p1_31"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to discuss clause 6.5. Clause 6.5 prohibits the Defendant from “associating with any company employee or any company in the same business” for “a period no less than 2 years”. The Plaintiff contends that this clause was designed to prohibit the Defendant from soliciting the employment of the Plaintiff’s employees. In my view, clause 6.5 goes beyond doing that. It prohibits the Defendant from “associating” with the Plaintiff’s employees altogether. The word “associate” could be construed to mean that the Defendant is prohibited from maintaining relationships, whether personal or professional, with the Plaintiff’s employees. While the Plaintiff is entitled to maintain a stable and trained workforce, there is no reason why it needs to prevent the Defendant from maintaining personal relationships with its employees. In my view, clause 6.5 is unreasonably wide.</a></p><a id="p1_32"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While clause 6.5 also seeks to prohibit the Defendant from associating with “any company in the same business”, the Plaintiff did not seek to rely on this clause to prevent the Defendant from joining Zenith Salon in its closing submissions. In any event, no arguments were made to sever the objectionable portions of clause 6.5, such that this portion of clause 6.5 could be saved. And even if such arguments were made, and even assuming the doctrine of severance allows portions of a single clause to be severed from the rest, I am doubtful whether the remaining portion of clause 6.5 is not objectionable. I say so for at least two reasons. First, the word “associate” is too wide. It is broad enough to encompass not only employment but also other forms of potentially non-objectionable dealings. For instance, it would be hard to fault the Defendant for patronising another “company in the same business” as a customer. Second, the temporal restriction of two years is too long for the same reasons discussed for clause 6.4 above.</a></p><a id="p1_33"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the Plaintiff failed to establish that clauses 6.4 and 6.5 do not go further than is necessary to protect the legitimate interest which the clauses were supposedly designed to protect. The clauses were drafted too broadly, going way beyond what was necessary to protect the Plaintiff’s trade connections and a stable workforce. They are void and unenforceable.</a></p><a id="p1_34"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For completeness, I would also add that even if clause 6.5 did amount to a valid non-solicitation clause, the Plaintiff failed to prove that the Defendant had solicited the Plaintiff’s employees to join her at Zenith Salon. The Plaintiff did not adduce credible evidence to prove that the Defendant induced two of its employees to join Zenith Salon. On the contrary, the evidence shows that such inducement was unlikely. The Defendant was in China and had not even commenced employment at Zenith Salon when the two employees resigned from the Plaintiff. Mong Xin Yi (“Ms Mong”), one of the employees allegedly poached by the Defendant, testified at trial that she resigned from the Plaintiff on 31 May 2021 and commenced employment after that with another company called LMDA Pte Ltd on 4 June 2021, before joining Zenith Salon on 23 August 2021. The Defendant was in China at that time of her resignation and only returned to Singapore on 30 July 2021. Ms Mong further testified that she was the one who suggested the Defendant seek employment in Singapore as the Defendant found it difficult to find employment in China due to lockdown restrictions imposed to control the Covid-19 pandemic.</a></p><a id="p1_35"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a><a id="p1_36">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the above reasons stated, I dismiss the claim.
