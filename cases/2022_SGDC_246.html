On 18 September 2018, the plaintiff underwent an operation for a spinal disc related problem. The plaintiff had been in pain for the previous few days and had been off work on medical leave. The medical evidence indicates that his recovery was incomplete, and that he continued to suffer disabilities. About a year later, the plaintiff then instituted the current action seeking damages from his former employer (D1) and the worksite occupiers (D2 and D3), stating that his spinal disc related problem arose from a specific incident at work on the 12 September 2018. In gist, the plaintiff claims that the defendants all owed him various duties of care and had breached those duties when he was worked in an unsafe manner that led to the specific incident taking place. The defendants all disputed liability and entered their Defences. In gist, the defendants refuted the plaintiff’s factual claims about the way he was supposedly worked on the 12 September 2018, and consequently, that the plaintiff’s spinal disc related problem was not the result of any unsafe work. The defendants do not dispute that the plaintiff had a spinal disc related problem, but they contend that the condition simply manifested itself and that they had discharged their responsibilities to ensure that the plaintiff was given appropriate leave from duties and medically attended to after it did. Given those positions taken by the parties, the trial on liability went on before me and necessarily focused on the factual issue as to whether the plaintiff suffered his injury in the course of unsafe work on the 12 September 2018. After a review of the evidence presented by the plaintiff, I found that he had failed to discharge his evidential burden to prove the factual issue of causation against the defendants. As a result, the plaintiff’s claim was ordered to be dismissed with costs, and brief grounds were issued by me in doing so. The plaintiff has since filed an appeal against my order. I now set down the full grounds for my decision.</a></p><a id=""> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues:</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a><a id="p1_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff instructed counsel for his action against the defendants. After the taking of instructions, the final pleaded position put forth by the plaintiff in his Statement of Claim (“SOC”) filed on the 10 September 2019 was that he suffered his spinal disc related problem as a result of a <em>specific incident</em> while at work on the 12 September 2018.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a> Based on that factual averment as to where, when, and how his injury was allegedly suffered, the plaintiff contends that the defendants are liable to him because the accident came about when they breached their various duties of care which they owed to him by working him in that manner which allowed that specific incident to take place.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> It was therefore clear that <b>for the plaintiff’s case to succeed, he had to firstly discharge the unshifting evidential burden of proof on the civil standard to establish the factual basis for his claim, i.e. that his injury was indeed suffered in the manner alleged in his pleadings.</b> If that factual basis was satisfactorily established, then the further issue which the plaintiff had to next establish was that the said manner of work accrued liability to the respective defendants. For the reasons explained below, I found that the plaintiff’s case failed at the first step. I now set out my findings on the evidence adduced for the first issue.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">I – Did the plaintiff suffer his injury while being worked in the manner alleged on the 12 September 2018?</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence which the plaintiff’s claim relies on consists almost entirely of his own testimony about what he says happened to him on that day. Whilst the plaintiff also alludes to the medical evidence, an objective review of that medical evidence will conclude that they do not amount to independent evidence as to what happened to the plaintiff at the worksite on the 12 September 2018. Indeed, the respective doctors were all not present at the worksite and they do not have any knowledge about what happened at the worksite; the doctors simply recited the history which they received – mostly from the plaintiff himself – in their medical reports. Additionally, their medical conclusions regarding the plaintiff’s spinal disc condition also do not amount to independent evidence which indicates that his factual claims about the way in which he was worked on the 12 September 2018 is more probable. Put another way, in so far as the medical conclusions were potentially coherent with the plaintiff’s factual claims about the specific incident that day, it was not exclusively so and those medical conclusions equally permitted the possibility that there was no workplace accident/injury and that his spinal disc related problem had simply manifested itself as part of its progression. It was therefore plain that focus remained on the testimony of the plaintiff to determine whether it was sufficient to establish the factual basis for his claim.</a></p><a id="p1_3"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a><a id="p1_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I start therefore by setting out the plaintiff’s allegation as to how he says he suffered his injury. The plaintiff alleged that he suffered his injury as a result of what may be termed as a <b><em>specific incident</em></b> while at work on the 12 September 2018. His SOC at [5] to [7] recounts that he was working with “<em>two other Chinese construction workers</em>” on that day to build the internal rebar cage meant for a concrete wall. It was uncontroversial that such work involved tying horizontal rebars at specific intervals to the two parallel rows of vertically standing rebars which were already in place. That work had commenced in the morning, and by about 11.45 am, the installed horizontal rebars for the section of the rebar cage which they were working on had reached a height of two meters. The plaintiff stated that there was a three-tier scaffold platform next to the rebar cage, and that he and the other two Chinese construction workers were on that scaffold platform as they worked (though the exact positions of each on that scaffold platform was not specified). The plaintiff also alleges that there was a pile of loose horizontal rebars that had been thrown down from the top to the <em>inside</em> of the rebar cage – this pile of loose horizontal rebars were resting on cross-member supports inside the rebar cage (the height of those cross-members was not specified), and those horizontal rebars were placed there for the team to retrieve and continue with the rebar cage construction. It was uncontroversial that each horizontal rebar, also known as a T13 rebar, measured about 12 m in length and weighed about 13 kg each. The plaintiff stated that he “<em>had to repeatedly bend over the scaffold rail</em>” and “<em>stretch himself all the way down to reach the pile to retrieve the rebars</em>”. At about 11.45 am, one of the Chinese construction workers had already lifted one end of a rebar from the pile inside the rebar cage, and the plaintiff was required “<em>to pick up the other </em><b><em>end </em></b><em>of that rebar</em>” (emphasis added). The plaintiff however found his end of that rebar “<em>lying beneath 60 rebars</em>” and the plaintiff “<em>had to exert a lot of strength to lift up his end of the said rebar and while doing so, heard a cracking sound from his back and he fell backwards on the scaffold</em>” and became seriously injured as a result.</a></p><a id="p1_4"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a><a id="p1_5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff substantively repeated this specific incident account in his Affidavit of Evidence-In-Chief (“AEIC”) which he affirmed on the 5 July 2020 for the purposes of tendering his evidence at the trial. There were however some notable differences: the plaintiff’s AEIC account alleged at [7] that there was a fourth party, another Bangladeshi construction worker (who remained un-named<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a>), who was also involved with him and the – variously either two or three – Chinese construction workers in the rebar cage construction.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff’s AEIC account did not however specify where each person was located when he allegedly suffered his injury. The plaintiff’s AEIC account did however state at [12] that by the time his injury was suffered, he had already “<em>repeatedly bent down and picked up about 100 to 120 rebars </em><b><em>from the centre </em></b><em>of the rebar cage</em>” (emphasis added). The plaintiff’s AEIC account also claimed at [13] that after the accident, the plaintiff’s “<em>co-workers came to assist</em>” him to the office to rest, and that he was taken to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital on the company lorry only later that night. The plaintiff’s AEIC did not however identify the “<em>co-workers who came to assist</em>” him. Finally, the plaintiff’s AEIC account attempted at [20] to enlarge the basis for his claim: the plaintiff stated that “<em>the work I was carrying out was unsafe because of its repetitive nature</em>”, duties which required him to “<em>reach down and pull up heavy rebars repeatedly without any rest</em>” and which work was “<em>over and above the work of carrying the rebars continuously first in the morning from the rebar storage area to the [rebar cage area]</em>”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having completed the recount of the plaintiff’s position as to his injury’s causation and the events immediately following – which I shall collectively refer to as his <b><em>original iteration</em></b> – I acknowledged that singular testimony from a plaintiff can discharge the burden of proof. For it to do so, it would need to be clear, complete, internally and externally coherent, and ideally remain consistent on the material aspects at each recount. Testimony with those qualities thus gains credibility for safe reliance by the court. The importance of those qualities are further highlighted when one considers that the defendants were disputing the plaintiff’s account as to how the rebar cage was constructed; the defendants claim that each T13 rebar was simply passed along and that there was no pile of loose T13 rebars resting on cross-member supports inside the middle of the rebar cage, and consequently, that the plaintiff did not even have occasion to stretch and strain in that manner alleged at all. An objective review of the plaintiff’s testimony showed that it lacked the qualities required for safe reliance by the court. The following areas of his testimony regarding causation of his injury were of concern:</a></p><a id="p1_6"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6"></a><a id="p1_6-p2_a">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Clarity &amp; Completeness</b>: The original iteration as to how he suffered his injury appears in his SOC. That iteration referenced the specific incident at 11.45 am which resulted in his injury; that incident being his having to stretch down and strain to lift the end of a specific T13 rebar which was lying beneath 60 other T13 rebars in the pile inside the rebar cage. That iteration was objectively simple and straightforward, and if that was indeed how the plaintiff suffered his injury, then one should be able to expect a measure of consistency on all the material aspects in its recount. It was therefore of concern that the plaintiff did not confidently and completely substantiate that account in his AEIC. Details as to who was present when that alleged incident happened remained unclear and changing, and even where each person was supposedly positioned when the incident happened was also not stated in the AEIC. It also did not inspire confidence that the plaintiff even appeared to shift factually in his AEIC as to the basis for his claim: from the injury being one suffered because of the specific incident, the averment at [20] of his AEIC stating that it was ‘unsafe for the defendants to have worked him repeatedly in heavy menial work over a long period earlier that morning without rest’ appeared to drift away from the specific incident causation complaint. This start state of the plaintiff’s evidence, being incomplete and wavering did not auger well.</a></p><a id="p1_6-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_6-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Coherence &amp; Consistency</b>: The plaintiff was expectedly probed on all those areas of his account during cross-examination, and he did not fare well. The answers as to how many persons were present with him when the incident allegedly took place continued to waver, and it remained unclear as to their respective positions. In the end, the plaintiff even deviated materially from the specific incident’s description as stated in his SOC and AEIC. This was not surprising when one considers that the original iteration was plainly untenable in the first place. That description of the plaintiff successfully identifying the correct rebar at his end from underneath a pile of 60 other identical rebars all bunched up closely together inside the small 30 cm spacing of the rebar cage and then proceeding to think it feasible to attempt to lift the end of that rebar from under those 60 other rebars was simply fanciful; 60 rebars would have a combined weight of 780 kilograms and lifting one rebar from under that pile would have required super-human strength.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a> It was therefore not surprising that the plaintiff abandoned that original iteration altogether during cross-examination. After much clarifications, the new version of the incident as offered up by the plaintiff was that (1) there were only 20 rebars and not 60 rebars in the pile<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>; (2) that there were 4 workers – including him – standing in a line on the scaffold platform, and that he was actually the second in line in the middle of the group and was not standing at one end of the rebars<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>; (3) that the first Chinese worker next to him had held up one end of a rebar, and that when the plaintiff bent <em>under</em> the guard rail to lift up his section of that rebar, he could not as he found it to be ‘<em>stuck with another rebar</em>’<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>; (4) that he had explained to the first Chinese worker that the rebar was stuck, but the Chinese worker got angry and proceeded to scold him, kick against the scaffold platform, and threaten to inform the plaintiff’s employer not to sign the plaintiff’s timecard for that day and also not to give him a job for the next day, before proceeding to demonstrate to the plaintiff how he should go <em>over</em> the guard rail and try to lift up the rebar<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>; (5) that when the plaintiff followed that worker’s demonstration and pulled on the rebar with both his hands, he felt a sharp pain in his back before falling backwards on to the scaffold platform<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>; (6) that there was a fellow Bangladeshi worker named Madbor Ramjan (“Ramjan”) who was then standing next in line to him, and that when Ramjan asked him what happened, the plaintiff had explained that he had a pain in his back, and Ramjan had then tried to explain that to the Chinese workers<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>; (7) that the Chinese workers had then asked Ramjan to bring the plaintiff down from the scaffold platform, and the plaintiff said that he could not even use the ladder and was safety harnessed down instead, but later contradicted and retracted this and said that he actually used the ladder to get down<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>. This new iteration of the incident was materially different from that set out in the plaintiff’s SOC and AEIC, and the lack of consistency was of concern. Significantly, it also meant that the original iteration set out in his pleadings was left contradicted and without support by the plaintiff. Having observed the plaintiff as he offered this new version in cross-examination, I did not get the impression that the plaintiff was firmly grounded at all on his complaint as to how he allegedly suffered his injury, and the changes in details along the way made it appear that this new version was being offered up by him on the fly. In fact, when cross-examination continued the next day, the plaintiff made further changes to his new version: that he could not pull up the rebar because it was “<em>lying below a few other rebars</em>” as opposed to it “<em>being stuck together with another rebar</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Other changes include the plaintiff saying that the rebar being attempted to be lifted was actually the <b>first</b> such rebar from that pile being retrieved.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Based on his recount of that morning’s earlier activities where he had completed installing 20 horizontal rebars for the lower section of the rebar cage, all this therefore directly contradicted his averment in his AEIC at [12] where he had grossly exaggerated that he “<em>had already repeatedly bent down and picked up about 100-120 rebars from the centre of the rebar cage</em>” by the time the accident occurred. I considered whether there were innocent reasons for the different iterations emanating from the plaintiff, particularly whether it was accountable to the challenges of interpretation, and I could not conclude that this was the case. A review of the notes of evidence will reveal that the plaintiff had no particular trouble following the questions in cross-examination, that he was obviously alive to their import, and was capable of being exact on his answers. In my judgment, the different recounts indicated that they were simply not grounded on fact, and that this plaintiff was willing to say anything in his attempt to pin blame for his condition on the defendants. Confirmation of this can be seen when his answers descended into absurdity as the cross-examination drew on: the Plaintiff indicated that after he felt the sharp pain in his back, he grabbed the guard rail to steady himself and tried to sit down but could not as he lost all strength in his right leg and ended up ‘falling backwards’ instead (away from the rebar which he had been straining against) with his lower back – the same area where he had just experienced the sharp pain, and not any other area of his body, making contact with the scaffold platform when he fell. In fact, that his ‘entire lower back fell flat’ and that it was possible for him to fall and hit himself at that area like that even though the scaffold platform decking he was standing on was only 20 cm wide because ‘flesh compresses’.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pause here and do not propose to go further into the plaintiff’s account on the subsequent events. This pause is to note that by the end of the cross-examination, the plaintiff’s pleaded case as to how he allegedly suffered his injury at work did not stand up to scrutiny, and was abandoned in the end by the plaintiff himself when he offered up a new version of the incident instead. The fact that the new version was also not entirely coherent and consistent did not matter that much because the plaintiff made no application to incorporate that as his case. The rules of litigation and procedural fairness demand that a party state the basis for its case clearly, and that where it is contested, be required to prove that case based on its pleaded position. An objective review of the plaintiff’s original iteration in its pleaded case, with its poor start state, and with its subsequent contradiction and abandonment, meant that there was only one possible conclusion: that it had not been factually established on balance that the plaintiff had suffered an injury in the manner alleged.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Other evidence:</p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the testimony of the plaintiff, the only other evidence which he tendered to court in support of his pleaded position was the testimony of Ramjan. To recap, Ramjan is the other fellow Bangladeshi worker who the plaintiff said was standing close by next to him on the same scaffold platform, and who was waiting on him for that section of the rebar to be lifted up. By the plaintiff’s own account, Ramjan witnessed the alleged incident. This meant that Ramjan’s testimony was capable of being entirely consistent with the plaintiff’s original iteration as set out in his pleaded case. A review of Ramjan’s AEIC will however find that this was not so. I now recount Ramjan’s version.</a></p><a id="p1_8"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a><a id="p1_9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of tendering his evidence before me at trial, Ramjan affirmed his AEIC on the 29 November 2020, and stated at [5] that he was also involved with ‘the plaintiff and <em>three</em> Chinese construction workers’ in the rebar cage construction that day. Ramjan claimed that at about 11.45 am on the 12 September 2018, he saw the plaintiff trying to lift a rebar from the pile but could not because there were other rebars on top of it. Ramjan then saw the plaintiff abandon that attempt and heard the plaintiff explain to one of the Chinese construction workers that he could not lift the rebar as there were other rebars on top of it. Ramjan then claims that the Chinese worker started to verbally abuse the plaintiff and told the plaintiff to “<em>lift that rebar or he will inform the foreman to deduct 2 hours of the plaintiff’s work</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a> Ramjan then saw the plaintiff try to lift the rebar again but failed. Ramjan then said that the Chinese worker continued to shout and verbally abuse the plaintiff. Ramjan then saw the plaintiff trying to lift the rebar (for the third time) “<em>until the rebar was bending into a L-like shape</em>” when suddenly the plaintiff <em>shouted</em> and fell onto the scaffold platform.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Ramjan said he was just 2 meters away and he rushed over to the plaintiff and asked him what happened, and the plaintiff replied that “<em>he heard a cracking sound from his back and felt intense pain while pulling the rebar</em>”. Ramjan also saw the plaintiff explaining to two Chinese workers when they came over. Ramjan then helped the plaintiff descend from the scaffold platform, but the plaintiff could walk no further due to pain in his back and in his leg. Ramjan said that he and another Chinese worker ended up “<em>carrying the plaintiff to the rest area</em>”. Ramjan then proceeded to have his lunch and he says he did not know what transpired thereafter.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A review of Ramjan’s evidence in his AEIC will conclude that it has some similarities to the plaintiff’s original iteration in his pleaded case. Though Ramjan’s account made no mention as to where that subject pile of rebars was located, nor any mention of a Chinese worker having first held up a particular rebar, nor the number of rebars which were in the pile on top of the one which the plaintiff was straining for, he does nonetheless imply that the plaintiff was positioned at one end of that pile of rebars (such that he managed to lift one up until it bent into an L-shape), and was trying – at the insistence of a Chinese worker – to lift a particular rebar up from beneath others when his back let out, and all that was minimally consistent with the plaintiff’s original iteration. The issue presented before me therefore was whether this account from this witness could stand alone and be held sufficient to support the plaintiff’s original iteration when the plaintiff himself had said that it actually did not happen that way and that it happened another way instead. I could not so conclude. I found the plaintiff’s own contradiction and subsequent abandonment of his original iteration so fundamental that it threw grave doubt over the inherent veracity of the original iteration, and Ramjan’s minimally consistent account in his AEIC simply could not remediate the situation and form the necessary support to independently prop it up.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also other reasons to be concerned about Ramjan’s credibility and objectivity as a witness when it came to stating things factually against the defendants. During cross-examination, it was revealed that Ramjan had sought compensation from D1 by lodging a complaint to the MOM that he suffered a worksite injury himself about a month later on 19 October 2018. However, the result after due inquiry with the relevant witnesses was the MOM issuing its Notice dated the 29 January 2019 to him (via his solicitors) that “<em>no compensation payable as employee’s injury was not caused by accident arising out of and in the course of employment</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a> A result which Ramjan could have, but did not contest further, and following which he lost his employment with D1 and was repatriated back to Bangladesh by D1 with the MOM’s clearance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> When questioned on these matters, Ramjan was dismissive of the MOM’s conclusion as being based on witness accounts who were biased by the defendants.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> I found Ramjan’s dismissiveness rather glib as it conveniently ignores the fact that he himself had contradictorily reported to the doctor that his injury was due to “<em>an assault</em>” and not as a result of an accident at work – a point for which he offered no coherent explanation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> Whilst I accept that all this did not mean that Ramjan lacked credibility in all things, it indicated minimally that some caution was due when it came to reviewing his objectivity against the defendants and the credibility of the testimony in his AEIC which he was now offering against them.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it turned out, Ramjan also failed to stay consistent on his AEIC account. Like the plaintiff, Ramjan contradicted the version stated in his AEIC and offered up a new version in cross-examination as to how the plaintiff allegedly suffered his injury. Ramjan’s new version was remarkably similar to the plaintiff’s new iteration which was also offered up in cross-examination. Given the new recount as to the positions of the various individuals in this new version, where the plaintiff was situated in the <em>middle</em> of the line of workers rather than at the end near the tips of the rebars, it became apparent that Ramjan’s earlier graphic averment in his AEIC about how he said he saw the plaintiff strain so hard ‘<em>until that rebar bent into an L-shape</em>’ was truly a gross exaggeration and false. Ramjan also remarkably disowned the averments in his AEIC that he heard the plaintiff shout out in pain, and that he saw the plaintiff fall.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a> All considered, it was my judgment that Ramjan’s testimony in his AEIC lacked credibility; being also contradicted and abandoned by this witness in cross-examination, it simply could not be safely relied upon.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion:</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To recap, the plaintiff’s plea was that he ought to be compensated because his disabilities allegedly arose from a specific incident at work. The defendants dispute that. The plaintiff therefore bears the evidential burden of establishing that he was indeed injured in that manner. The plaintiff appeared to do so in his AEIC. However, the plaintiff later said that it actually did not happen like that and offered a new version instead. His witness also did the same thing. Therefore, with all the original evidence being disavowed, there was nothing left over before the court which supported his allegation as stated in his pleaded case. The inevitable conclusion was that the plaintiff’s pleaded case had not been established, and his action deserved to be dismissed.</a></p><a id="p1_13"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff may argue that his action should be reviewed based on the final account offered up since that final account still maintained that his disabilities were suffered at work. That argument ignores the rules of litigation which place the onus on the plaintiff to make clear the basis for his claim, and glosses over the fact that the plaintiff had fundamentally changed his factual position in that regard. It was also my judgment that taking the final account would not have changed the result because the final account was also lacking in clarity, coherence, and consistency, with both the plaintiff and his witness materially contradicting themselves and each other on the details. The descriptions as to the subsequent events also suffered similar flaws which threw further doubt as to the veracity of the final account.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, with the evidence of causation left in that state before me, the plaintiff’s case could not be said to have been established on balance. Accordingly, the plaintiff’s case against the defendants was dismissed with costs to be taxed if not agreed.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"></a><p class="Footnote"><a id="p1_15"><sup></sup></a><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a>[5]-[7] of the SOC.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>[8] and [9] of the SOC.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>The plaintiff only named this fellow Bangladeshi worker during cross-examination in court, i.e. that it was one Madbor Ramjan: NE, day 1, page 24.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>[7] of the plaintiff’s AEIC was badly drafted.
