that the Accused was working in. The victim worked as a delivery driver in the company, whereas the Accused worked as a ‘carrier’ in charge of physically delivering parcels to customers. The Accused and the victim would work in tandem to make deliveries around Singapore. In the course of making these deliveries, the Accused and victim would frequently be required to provide identity documents to register for entry passes into secured premises such as condominiums. As the victim would be driving a motor vehicle whilst they made the deliveries, he would pass his NRIC and driving licence to the Accused, who would then disembark from the vehicle to register for entry into these secured premises at security posts. There were also multiple occasions where the victim had sent images of his driving licence and NRIC to the Accused via the ‘WhatsApp’ application, for the ease of facilitating their entry into these secured premises around Singapore.</a></p><a id="p1_7"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a><a id="p1_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victim did not consent to the Accused’s retention and use of his NRIC particulars and driving licence particulars for purposes other than the registration for entry into secured premises.

Sometime on 13 January 2021, the Accused formed a plan to use the NRIC particulars and driving licence particulars of the victim to rent a motorcar from the company Drive Lah Singapore Pte Ltd (“the company”). He then created a profile on an application created by the company using the name of the victim, as well as the victim’s NRIC details and driving licence particulars. Thereafter, under the victim’s name, he rented a motorcar bearing vehicle registration number SKQ 2701C (“the motorcar”) from the company on its application<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At about 11pm on 13 January 2021, the Accused proceeded to a carpark located at Block 752 Woodlands Circle, Singapore, where he picked up the motorcar that he had rented under the victim’s name. As he had successfully made a booking under the victim’s name with the company, the Accused was able to successfully collect the car keys of the motorcar, which had been placed under the motorcar’s front left tire for the driver to pick up. The Accused then drove the motorcar out of the carpark and picked up two friends at the Hougang and Sengkang regions of Singapore, before heading to the Geylang region for supper. The Accused and his two companions finished eating their supper at about 3am on 14 January 2021, after which the Accused decided to ferry his companions home by car.</a></p><a id="p1_10"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a><a id="p1_11">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 3.20am on 14 January 2021, the Accused was spotted by uniformed Traffic Police (“TP”) officers, driving the motorcar along Tampines Expressway (“TPE”) towards the Pan Island Expressway (“PIE”) and travelling at a high speed of 126 km/h, which was above the road speed limit of 90 km/h. The TP officers then followed the Accused’s motorcar on their motorcycles and signalled for the Accused to bring his vehicle to a halt. However, knowing that he was driving a car rented under the victim’s name and that he did not possess a valid driving licence at the time, the Accused refused to comply with the orders made by the TP officers. He then accelerated the motorcar away from the TP officers, intending to avoid being apprehended by them. TP officers then gave chase, seeing that the Accused was now trying to flee from them, and actively defying an order to stop his vehicle<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At about 3.29am on 14 January 2021, whilst travelling at a high speed of 192 km/h along TPE, which was above the road speed limit of 90 km/h, the Accused lost control of the motorcar, and collided the motorcar into a directional sign (U-turn signage) along the road<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the accident, the weather was clear, the road surface was dry, traffic flow was light and visibility was good. The front portion of the motorcar was dislodged, dented and scratched as a result of the collision. No injuries were also caused as a result of the collision to any of the passengers in the vehicle. At the material time, there was no policy of insurance or security in respect of third-party risks in force as the Accused had rented the motorcar fraudulently- under the name of the victim<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Facts Relating to the Second Set of Proceeded Charges</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This set of offences were committed by the Accused after he had pleaded guilty to the First Set of charges.</a></p><a id="p1_14"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a><a id="p1_15">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 19 August 2022 at about 6.39pm, the Accused was stopped for checks by the Complainant, LTA Enforcement Officer Ganesan (“Complainant”), whilst he was driving motorcar SLV 8091B (“motorcar”) along the Central Expressway towards the direction of Seletar Expressway before the Braddell Road exit. The Accused was unable to produce a driving licence when requested to do so by the Complainant, and later admitted to the Complainant that he did not have a valid driving licence.</a></p><a id="p1_15"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a><a id="p1_16">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investigations subsequently revealed that the Accused had at the time only possessed a Class ‘3’ Provisional Driving Licence (“PDL”) which was due to expire on 2 October 2022. The Accused, being the driver of the motorcar when he was only the holder of a Class 3 PDL, failed to comply with the conditions subject under which a PDL was granted to him. He drove the said motorcar without displaying the distinguishing marks required under Schedule 5 of the Road Traffic (Motor Vehicles, Driving Licence) Rules on the front and rear of the motorcar. Further, he drove the motorcar without the supervision of a person holding an instructor’s licence<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a>.

At the time of the commission of both the first set and second set of offences and when he pleaded guilty, the Accused was below 21 years old. It was clear that rehabilitation was the dominant sentencing consideration in this case.

Defence Counsel asked the Court to consider “<em>material changes to [his] client’s life</em>”. He submitted that the contents of the RT report spoke of how the Accused had shown significant improvement in his behaviour; how he had distanced himself with negative peers and was now very focused in his new business, spending time with his girlfriend et cetera.

Having perused both the probation report and the supplementary probation report, I did not see any reason to disagree with the findings of the Probation Officer. The viability of putting the Accused on probation had been thoroughly considered by the Probation Officer not once but on two separate occasions, and the end result was the same – probation was not recommended for the Accused.</a></p><a id="p1_28"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As reminded in <em>A Karthik v Public Prosecutor</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22640-SSP.xml')">[2018] 5 SLR 1289</a>, a case where the Appellant had requested for a shorter probation period and a shorter number of community service hours, on the basis that the Appellant’s rehabilitation could be sustained “even with minimal formal intervention”, the Court had this to say:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“….<em>while it is true that “the sentencing decision … lies within the exclusive remit of the court alone” such that the court is not bound to accept a probation officer’s recommendations (Praveen Krishnan ([66] supra) at [65]–[67]), the recommendations of probation officers generally ought to carry considerable weight…..</em></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <em>In my view, it makes good sense for the court to give careful consideration to the reports prepared by probation officers. It is the probation officer who is usually best apprised of the offender’s circumstances and, hence, of his suitability for the probation regime. Therefore, the court should ordinarily be slow to depart from the recommendations of a probation officer unless: (a) it is clear that the circumstances upon which the probation officer’s recommendations were based were factually incorrect or have since changed materially; or (b) there was no proper basis for the probation officer’s recommendations.”</em> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>A Karthik</em>, the Court saw no reason to depart from the recommendations in the probation report and in allowing the appeal, the Court substituted a term of imprisonment with probation on the terms as recommended by the Probation Officer.</a></p><a id="p1_30"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having considered both the reports, there was no basis to depart from the recommendations of the Probation Officer. She had given a clear explanation in her reports as well as in court why she did not recommend the Accused for probation. There was no dispute in respect of the factual basis on which she had made the recommendation and the change in Accused’s personal circumstances over time had also been duly considered by her in the supplementary probation report.</a></p><a id="p1_31"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a><a id="p1_32">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of any rehabilitative process, personal preferences and conveniences may inevitably have to take a back seat in order to achieve the desired outcome. The considerations that the Accused’s business “<em>is beneficial for [the Accused] in the sense that it has somehow given him some form of stability in his life, and also an ability for him to provide for his family, for himself”</em>, and how it would be <em>“quite a pity if [the Accused] doesn’t get probation, and unfortunately gets sent to RTC, and the business has to go down the drain</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a>, and/or that it may mean a loss of income to the tune of $30,000 a month<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> and cause hardship to the staff involved in the Accused’s business<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>, were in my mind, weak considerations which could not justify a decision to impose a term of probation. As Ms Xu rightly pointed out, this “<em>unfortunate circumstance</em> (of losing the business<em>) … is brought about due to his own actions</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> [sic]. If not being placed on probation but spending time in reformative training meant that the Accused may have to re-build his business from scratch after he is released, that may very well be an important part in the entire maturing process of rehabilitation for the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Reformative Training as the Appropriate Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the Accused was found physically and mentally suitable for a term of reformative training. The RT report recognized that the Accused had needs that required intervention. Similar to the probation report which noted the Accused’s minimisation of offences, the RT report stated that the Accused “<em>would benefit from attending programmes that addressed his attitudes towards crime, specifically in his tendency to minimise the consequences of offending</em>” <span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As re-emphasized in <em>Public Prosecutor v Ong Jack Hong</em> </a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19524-SSP.xml')">[2016] 5 SLR 166</a>, at [11], “<em>the imposition of reformative training remains within the range of sentencing options for young offenders where the focus is on rehabilitation …….. reformative training too is geared towards the rehabilitation of the offender and hence remains a viable option</em>”. At [14] of <em>Ong Jack Hong</em>, the Court went on to state: “<em>the choice between reformative training and probation is governed primarily by whether there is in the circumstances a need for a degree of deterrence within an overarching focus and emphasis on rehabilitation</em>”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, I was satisfied that a term of reformative training would be the appropriate sentence for the Accused.

As reported, during the interview, the Accused rationalized his recent case in August 2022 as a convenient means to meet his client during peak hours. He mentioned that he was unable to hire a private car vehicle for the appointment and told himself that driving his girlfriend’s car would “be a quick one” and that “it’ll be ok”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found the tendency of the Accused to justify his actions and the commission of the offences for instant gratification to be particularly troubling. With this prevailing mindset and attitude, it was unsurprising that the Accused committed further offences even after he pleaded guilty to the First Set of charges and was awaiting sentence. Even the possibility of being sent to a term of reformative training did not appear to deter him. In my view, the commission of fresh offences whilst being embroiled in court proceedings also demonstrated a clear lack of insight by the Accused into his own offending. A measure of deterrence was warranted.</a></p><a id="p1_37"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a><a id="p1_38">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having regard to the Accused’s character, previous conduct and the circumstances of the offences, I was satisfied that a term of reformative training was necessary to reform the Accused. The proposed term of a Level One intensity of rehabilitation which carried with it a minimum of a six-month detention in the RTC had likely factored in the positive changes which had taken place in the Accused’s life in this period, going by the contents in the RT report.
