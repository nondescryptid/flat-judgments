Further, the accused was “aware” that the urine in the two Blue Urine Containers would be sent to HSA for testing.

This turned on the facts of the case. Based on the evidence provided at the trial, I found that there was no break in the chain of custody. The accused held onto the urine specimens at all times, and when he was not doing so, the specimens were kept within his line of sight. This was the case while the accused was escorted from Woodlands Police Division to Tanglin Police Division, while he was changing his clothes, while he was at his cell at Tanglin Police Division, and while the IUT was taking place. It bore emphasis that the IUT result which was disputed by the accused was the same as the HSA result for the urine specimens which were in the accused’s line of sight throughout.</a></p><a id="p1_28"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a><a id="p1_29">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, PW3 and PW11 testified that all accused persons with COVID-19 symptoms had to be brought to Tanglin Police Division, which was the designated location for persons-in-custody with COVID-19 symptoms.

This was for cases where an accused person was warded in a hospital. It demonstrated that this practice was not unique or conducted for the first time. In addition, I noted the prosecution’s point that there was no requirement under the Misuse of Drugs (Urine Specimens and Urine Tests) Regulations for urine procurement, IUT and sealing to be carried out at the same location.</a></p><a id="p1_30"> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a><a id="p1_31">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the prosecution witnesses provided detailed evidence and consistent testimony.

The accused had the opportunity to raise this in his statements, but he did not do so.

However, the accused did not raise concerns to PW2 during the urine procurement process. In addition, the accused’s statements did not contain any of these points which the accused identified as “serious issues with urine procurement”. If these were indeed serious issues in the accused’s opinion, the accused would have raised them during the urine procurement process or in his statements, especially since the accused had previous experience with the urine procurement process. On the contrary, the accused asked for leniency in the Notice of Warning.</a></p><a id="p1_33-p2_a"> </a><p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a><a id="p1_33-p2_b">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not accept the accused’s explanation that he did not know the procedure when the prosecution posed the point to the accused that he would not have agreed to send the urine specimens to HSA if they had not been his.

highlighted that general deterrence aimed to educate and deter other like-minded members of the general public by making an example of a particular offender and dissuading the public from committing drug offences. In the present case, specific deterrence also applied, as the accused was heavily traced for multiple drug, property and other offences involving weapons, gaming, affray and desertion from civil defence.<span class="FootnoteRef"></span></a><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prosecution sought an imprisonment term of seven years and six months to eight years, with six strokes of the cane.

The accused’s consistent pattern of offending did not present an optimistic picture for his rehabilitative prospects. The accused’s long string of drug-related antecedents dating back to 2009 (including drug trafficking, drug consumption, drug possession, possession of drug utensils and failing to report for urine test offences) showed an overall lack of commitment to rehabilitation and reintegration. In addition, the offence was identical in nature to the offence for which the accused was placed on a remission order.

There must be specific deterrence. The Charge was a Long Term 2 offence for which the accused claimed trial.

The fresh offence was the same as the offence for which the remission order was given. Further, the fresh offence was committed shortly over a year from the start date of the remission order. This demonstrated the accused’s inclination to reoffend. The accused’s rehabilitative prospects were low. I found that this fell within Band 3 (high degree of severity) of the <em>Mutalib</em> framework, which was 2/3 to the full remaining duration of the remission order at the time of the fresh offence. In my assessment, the appropriate enhanced sentence for this offence was 130 days. This did not exceed the main sentence for the Charge.</a></p><a id="p1_45"> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion </p> </a><p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a><a id="p1_46">46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused was convicted on the Charge.
